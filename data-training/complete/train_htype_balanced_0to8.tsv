I‚Äôm against hunting. In fact, I‚Äôm a hunt saboteur. I go out the night before and shoot the fox.	4
every object, thing and product in the world is free, you are not paying for the actual thing, only for the work people have put into it.   so a hunter makes a snare or a trap out of some wood and catches an animal, he sells it to a butcher and asks for money for his time spent catching and handling the animal. the animal and the makeshift trap did not cost him any money so the only expense for him was the time he spent. then the butcher cuts the animal into stakes and pieces of meat and sells the meat to a chef, adding his fee to the amount that he paid to the hunter. the chef takes the meat and prepares it and sells it to the customer again adding whatever his time is worth to the sum he had paid for the meat.   so no one actually pays for the thing, only for the cumulative amount of time every person that has contributed to the final product.  yes, there is rent, cost of tools, loans and interests, but all of them can be broken down to the first piece of metal found in the ground, or the first rock picked up. all of these things that need to be accounted for are just branches of cumulative actions that have contributed to a larger branch that comes together to form a tree that finally ends up as the product.     as every link in the chain is using multiple chains to complete his action, the value of time in a certain link can be found from the length and amount of said chains that connect to that link.  tl;dr cars are free, price is an illusion, only time has value.	6
