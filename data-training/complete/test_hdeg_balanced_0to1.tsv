a protester walks into a bar...     â¦and orders a drink. itâs midday on a weekday, and with covid19 and the fires, the bar is basically empty, except for a gay man sitting at the other end of the bar.  the gay man immediately notices him, dressed in all black, looking mysterious. when the protester takes his mask off, the gay man is taken aback by how beautiful he is. he must go talk to him. unfortunately, heâs a bit shy, so he decides to order a few more drinks to help him overcome his shyness. he drinks them quickly, so he can build up his courage before the protester leaves.  after consuming several drinks, the gay man feels confident enough to approach the protester. he walks up to him and introduces himself. they make small talk for a bit.   unfortunately, the drinks in rapid succession start to creep up on the gay man. he starts to slur his speech, lose his inhibitions, and becomes way too overconfident. he leans into the protesterâs ear and whispers:  âhow about i give you a blow jobâ  upon hearing this, the protester leaps off of his stool, grabs the gay manâs collar, and drags him across the bar. he opens the door, throws him out, and yells:  âdonât you ever say that to me again!â  he slams the door shut and storms back to his barstool.  the bartender is in shock. he asks the protester:  âwhat the heck did he say to you?â  the protester responds:  âi donât know, something about giving me a jobâ	1

"jesus & moses in a boat so jesus and moses were rowing a boat fishing for supper and after no action jesus was getting bored and he was like 'hey moishe, moishe--check it out, you think i can still walk on water? you think i still have it? how much you wanna bet i can still walk on water?' moses says 'i'll take any bet you put up.' he says half serious. so jesus steps out of the boat and stands up on the water outside one foot at a time. he straightens up, takes one step, takes another, turns around, smiles, and then--  \\---he plummets to the bottom of the lake! he's drowning! bubbles are coming up there's nothing at the surface, so moses breathes in and takes one of the oars and dips it into the water--he holds his arms out wide and two giant waves burst up and part the lake in front of the boat, he breathes out--and all the snapping turtles and perch and bass and sunnies are floppin around at the bottom of the lake floor with jesus right in the middle--he's coughing up algae and snot, getting his legs caught in the muck up to his knees, a couple of fishing lures hooked to his robe in different places. moses smiles, asks god for a little umph and is able to lift jesus back up with the oar's power into the boat, he returns the water back to normal, gently--all the animals are fine.   moses sits jesus down on the middle bench. jesus is hacking and burping with his head in his hands and when he's done he yells 'what the hell happened man?! what the hell?! i'm the son of god i am the lord of heavens & earth what is this shit?' moses shakes his head and he says   my friend, you didn't have holes in your feet last time!"	1

""**hey, barkeep!**"", he yells. ""**gimme that bottle o' whiskey!**""  shaking, the barkeeper hands the bottle over. in one massive gulp, he downs the entire bottle before smashing it over his own head.

""simply hold a lighted match directly under his feet."" was the shop owner's reply.  the shop owner held a lighted match under the parrot's left foot. chet began to sing: ""jingle bells! jingle bells! ..."" the shop owner then held another match under the parrot's right foot. then chet's tune changed, and the air was filled with: "" silent night, holy night...""  the young man was so impressed that he paid the shop-keeper and ran home as quickly as he could with chet under his arm. when the wife saw her gift she was overwhelmed.  ""how beautiful!"" she exclaimed, ""can he talk?"" ""no,"" the young man replied, ""but he can sing. let me show you."" so the young man whipped out his lighter and placed it under chet's left foot, as the shop-keeper had shown him, and chet crooned: ""jingle bells! jingle bells!..."" the man then moved the lighter to chet's right foot, and out came: ""silent night, holy night...""  the wife, her face filled with curiosity, then asked, ""what if we hold the lighter between his legs?"" the man did not know. ""let's try it,"" he answered, eager to please his wife. so they held the lighter between chet's legs. chet twisted his face, cleared his throat, and the little parrot sang out loudly like it was the performance of his life: ""chet's nuts roasting on an open fire...."""	1

""i owe you a debt l of gratitude! your idea saved the day! i've been reading reviews online and everybody is raving about how much they enjoyed the show!""  the stagehand nodded confidently and said, ""i'm not surprised. redditors love a good play on words."""	1

"so there was this man in bulgaria who drove trains for a living. he loved his job. driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. he loved to make the train go as fast as possible. unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. he made it out, but a single person died. well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. he was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. when the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. after eating the banana, he was strapped intoÂ the electric chair. the switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. the man was perfectly fine. Â   well, at the time, there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. the trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. for his final meal, the man requested two bananas. after eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed. Â   well, this of course meant that he was free to go. and once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. to what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. on the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas. Â   ""you know what? no,"" said the executioner. ""i've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. i'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. the switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. the executioner was speechless.   the man looked at the executioner and said, ""oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. i'm just a bad conductor."""	1

so this city blonde goes to a barn she asks the farmer: âexcuse me, why does that cow have no horns?â.   the farmer, being quite the expert on the matter, explained to her with great detail:   âwell mâam, thereâs many reasons why some cows donât have horns. some breeds donât have horns. for example: angus cows donât have horns. another reason is that when youâve been milking a cow for too long, their horns get very sensitive, so we remove them in a process thatâs completely painless to the animal. and sometimes, when theyâre calves, we donât want them to grow horns so we put a little acid where the horns would grow and they never grow horns.   but the reason why that cow doesnât have horns is because itâs a horseâ.	1

""so you're telling me you were speeding...and committed a robbery?"" ""yes,"" the man calmly says. ""i have the loot in the back.""  the cop begins to get angry.

""i'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!"" the cop pulls his hand out. ""wait here,"" he says.  the cop calls for backup. soon cops, cars, and helicopters are flooding the area. the man is cuffed quickly and taken towards a car. however, before he gets in, a cop walks up to him and says, while gesturing to the cop that pulled him over, ""sir, this officer informed us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. however, we found none of these things in your car."" the man replies, ""yeah, and i bet that liar said i was speeding too!"""	1

""well, as i was saying, i had just loaded bessie, my favorite cow, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my john deer tractor right in the side. i was thrown into one ditch and bessie was thrown into the other. i was hurting, real bad and didn't want to move. however, i could hear old bessie moaning and groaning. i knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.  shortly after the accident a highway patrolman came on the scene. he could hear bessie moaning and groaning, so he went over to her. after he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. then the patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, ""how are you feeling?""

"a man was traveling through asia when one night, he stopped at a monastery he asked the monks for a place to sleep and some food, and the monks indulged him. but that night, he couldn't sleep. he kept hearing this droning, thumping sound. after a while, he went to investigate. he followed the sound down the stairs, into the basement. there he encountered a richly decorated room. he tried open the door, but it wouldn't budge. he tried to peer through the keyhole, but couldn't see anything either. disappointed, he went back to bed.  the next morning, he asked the abbot what the sound was. the abbot said: ""i would love to tell you what it is, but you'd have to become a monk first. it's a long and arduous process, so you have to be really dedicated."" the man declined, and went on his way. yet, the curiosity stayed with him. he traveled the world, and nowhere did he find anything as mesmerizing as the sound. each night in his sleep he could hear the sound again. at long last, he decided to return to the monastery and become a monk.  ""to become a monk,"" said the abbot, ""you have to finish three tasks, each one of which will test one of your qualities. the first one is patience. you have to sit in the garden and wait until the brown flutterer lands on your head. but beware! the brown flutterer is the shyest of all butterflies.""  so the man went into the garden and sat there for days on end. he braved hunger and cold, heat and illness. he sat there unmovingly, not even blinking, waiting for the brown flutterer. the only reason he stayed sane was by focusing on his goal: uncovering the source of the magical sound that had nested in his brain. a few times, the brown flutterer entered the garden, but even the slightest hint of excitement would scare it off again. then finally, after a few months, only when the man had complete mastery of his body and mind, did the brown flutterer land on his head. he returned to the abbot and reported it to him.  the abbot said: ""great, you are now ready for the next test. this one will test your perserverance. you will have to go to the island at the end of the world and find the golden orb."" so the man set out to find the golden orb. first, he traveled to new zealand. from there on out, he took a boat to a barely known island in the pacific. then he rented a small sloop and went looking for the island at the end of the world. it was only a few weeks before he found it. while there, he systematically searched the island. he inched his way through the impassible ravine, he dogded horrible wild beasts in the jungle of terror and he felt his way through the pitch black of the dark caves until finally, somewhere on mount snow, he found the gold orb. he retraced his steps and went back to the monastery.  ""incredible,"" said the abbot, ""and now you can begin with the third and last test. this one will test your balance. you must cross the gorge without bottom blindfolded, on a rope and one-legged."" the man immediately started training. he stood on one leg for days on end, he walked on a rope for miles and he walked around blindfolded until he was able to find his way without problem. then he combined these skills: he hopped around blindfolded, he crossed every rope on one leg and he felt his way across any rope without seeing. then, when he finally mastered the skills, he crossed the rope over the gorge without bottom.  he went back to the monastery and told the abbot. the abbot cheered and said: ""you are the first person in twenty years to complete the three tasks. at last, you are ready to see the source of the sound. come with me."" they went to the basement and there the abbot took out a stained golden key, hanging by a chord from his neck. he put it in the lock, and the doors swung open, and there it was: the source of the sound.   i would love to tell you what it is, but you'd have to become a monk first."	1

an arm with no body crawls into a military recruiting station.     the sergeant looks on in amazement as the arm hops onto his desk, grabs a pen and writes;   âiâm here to enlist!â  âyou canât enlist, youâre just an arm!â  the arm quickly wraps itself around the sergeantâs neck and puts him into a submission hold; letting him go just before he passes out.  the arm writes, âhow about now?â  the sergeant reluctantly agrees and the arm goes off to basic training.  the drill sergeant at basic training doesnât believe his eyes, but the arm is amazing at every drill and task set before it. the arm passes basic training with flying colors.  shipped off to war, the arm serves admirably. able to infiltrate nearly impossible enemy positions, the arm is given numerous medals and commendations for bravery and duty.  the arm eventually tries out for and succeeds in joining the elite delta force. on a particularly dangerous mission the rest of the squad is captured and is taken to a remote location to be tortured and killed.  before they can begin, the arm assaults the enemyâs position. using his training heâs able to kill all the enemies freeing the squad, but accidently trips a mine and loses everything below the elbow.  thereafter, the arm began what would be his final and most rewarding career.   that of a shoulder of fortune.	1

""yes,"" the greyhound replies. after recovering from the shock of hearing the greyhound talk, the man asks, ""so, tell me your story."" the greyhound looks up and says, ""well, i discovered that i could talk when i was pretty young. i wanted to help the government, so i told the sas. ""in no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one imagined that a greyhound would be eavesdropping. ""i was one of their most valuable spies for eight years. but the jetting around really tired me out, and i knew i wasn't getting any younger so i decided to settle down. i signed up for a job at heathrow to do some undercover security work, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. i uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded several medals. i got married, had a few puppies, and now i've just retired."" the man is amazed. he goes back into the house and asks the owner how much he wants for the greyhound.

the kindness of the elderly . . . when we get older, we think differently, don't we? this letter was sent to the principal's office after the school had sponsored a luncheon for the elderly.Â  an elderly lady received a new radio at the lunch as a door prize and was writing to say thank you. this story is a credit to all humankind . . . especially if you are familiar with the elderly.Â Â    dear kean elementary,  god bless you for the beautiful radio i won at your recent senior citizens luncheon.  i am 84 years old and live at the springer home for the aged. all of my family has passed away.Â  i am all alone now and it's nice to know that someone is thinking of me.  god bless you for your kindness to an old forgotten lady.Â  my roommate is 95 and has always had her own radio, but before i received one, she would never let me listen to hers, even when she was napping. the other day her radio fell off the nightstand and broke into a lot of pieces. it was awful and she was in tears. her distress over the broken radio touched me and i knew this was god's way of answering my prayers.  she asked if she could listen to mine, and i told her to kiss my ass.  thank you for that opportunity.  sincerely,  agnes	1

"in the empire of china, under the reign of emperor taizong... in the empire of china, under the reign of emperor taizong, a young courtier resided in the noble palace. this courtier, in particular, was known to be considerably disliked by the rest of the court, on account of rumors about the true nature of his parentage (it was alleged that his mother had been impregnated by a base commoner who had been able to slip past the guards of his father's manor house). while they would never stoop to an assassination attempt, the nobles generally agreed that the boy was an embarrassment, and that something must be done to remove him from the court to spare the emperor from his unsightly existence.     one of the higher-ranking nobles was able to catch the emperor's ear, and suggested to his heavenly majesty that it might be advisable for the king to map out some of his southern provinces in greater detail, and that a trusted advisor should accomplish the work- someone like young lu zhishen, who had served the emperor well and was likely suited to such a task. the emperor agreed to this, and before long lu zhishen was forced to pack his bags and set out to the south.     lu zhishen first stopped in a village named shÄnjiÇo, which means mountain foot. the beds there were rough, the people spoke in an uncouth manner, and there was little to no of the luxury he had become accustomed to. as his retainers bargained for supplies and scouted out the local woods. lu zhishen felt a restlessness creep over him, and resolved to inspect the village himself, to determine anything of interest that might befit the attention of the emperor. he left his room, and, upon surveying the village for a few minutes, noted a few strange anomalies. firstly, there were no young men of his age. there were boys, older men, and the elderly, and girls of every age, but it seemed as if all the young men between twenty and thirty summers of age had mysteriously vanished. secondly, as he inspected the tall mountain range for which the village was named, he noted a strange red shape high up along the winding path through the mountains.     pulling aside an old man, he interrogated him for answers.   ""old man, what is up on that mountain, and why can i find no young men within this village?""   the old man smiled his toothy grin, and replied thus:   ""upon that mountain is the temple of the buddha. once the young men here reach twenty years of age, they are required to climb that mountain and spend ten years in the temple along with the other monks there.""   ""ten years!"" lu zhishen exclaimed. ""and what do they accomplish while they are up there? do they debate, or read scripture?""   the old man shook his head. ""they meditate, in utter silence. once a man steps foot through the gateway of the temple, he must not speak another word until a decade has passed.""     stunned and fascinated by this, lu zhishen returned to his quarters, where he took a meager meal and rested until the morning. when he woke up, he left the inn only to find that the town was nearly empty, devoid of any inhabitants. returning to the innkeeper, he inquired about this.   ""they are likely waiting out in their fields,"" the innkeeper replied. ""it is the harvest day- the day of the reaping.""   ""waiting?"" lu zhishen replied. ""there are only so many hours in the day to work- whatever are they waiting for?""   ""the monks,"" the innkeeper replied. ""it is customary for the monks to begin the reaping.""     lu zhishen walked to the fields, and sure enough watched as a chain of orange-clothed monks descended down the mountain. meanwhile, the farmers all stood idle in their fields, watching the group slowly descend. all this was quite irritating to lu zhishen, but he kept quiet as the ritual proceeded. finally, the monks arrived, each carrying boxes from which emanated a delicious smell. all at once, the monks stood at attention, and with the ringing of a bell from the center monk (who lu zhishen determined to be an abbot or leader of some kind), all of them shouted ""time to harvest!""   all at once, all of the farmers sprung to work- some cutting their fields, others sampling the food the monks had brought. meanwhile, the monks broke into fevered discussion- amongst themselves, and to the farmers. this confused lu zhishen greatly, and so he turned to a nearby farmer.   ""doesn't it break their vows to shout and speak like that?""   the farmer shrugged. ""you'd think so, but apparently not. the abbot only permits speech now, and only he knows why. you could've asked the old abbot, but unfortunately, he died a month ago.""     the next day, lu zhishen set off on his journey to map the rest of the south. he encountered many more adventures, most of which are too long and too complex to be fully detailed here. there were many things that seemed strange or obscure, but none so much as that peculiar farming ritual he had observed his first week in shÄnjiÇo. he puzzled it over in his head for months on end, but could never come to a conclusion as to why such a flagrant violation would be allowed under the laws of the monastery.     a year after he left, lu zhishen once more returned to shÄnjiÇo, once more upon the day of the reap. once more, the monks descended from the mountain, and once more the same peculiar ritual was observed. lu zhishen refrained from interacting this time, instead doing his best to guess at the intentions of the abbot. after the reaping, he rushed to the abbot's side and begged him to explain this contradiction, but the abbot only smiled and touched his lips, bound to silence as they all were.     lu zhishen rode for seven more years, growing into a man. after years of arduous labor, he completed his map of the south, and began to ride north, on the verge of fulfilling his promise to the emperor. all thoughts of the monks and their strange ritual escaped from his mind, until, one day, as he rode through shÄnjiÇo, he was accosted by an old man.   ""lu zhishen!"" yelled the man. ""it's me- the farmer you spoke to! the old abbot has retired! now's your chance to ask him!""     intrigued, lu zhishen immediately tied up his horse and went to the old abbot's cottage, where the same man he'd tried to speak to seven years earlier now sat, slowly drinking a pot of stew. lu zhishen bowed heavily.   ""grandfather,"" he said. ""i have seen your rituals, but there is one question that has always eluded me: why do you allow your monks to speak on the days of the reaping?""   the old man smiled, and gave this simple answer: ""my son, to be a good host, one must engage their guests in conversation. and as any scholar of the buddha would tell you, reap hosting is an excellent way to accumulate karma."""	1

""where are you off to?"" asked the scarecrow. ""i'm off to see the wizard to see if he can take me back to kansas,"" said dorothy.  ""do you think he can give me a brain?"" asked the scarecrow. ""i suppose,"" replied dorothy. and so, dorothy and the scarecrow set off down the yellow-brick road.  dorothy and the scarecrow walked through a forest and met a man made of tin. ""where are you off to?"" asked the tin man. ""i'm off to see the wizard to see if he can take me back to kansas,"" said dorothy. ""and to see if he can give me a brain,"" added the scarecrow.  ""do you think he can give me a heart?"" asked the tin man. ""i suppose,"" replied dorothy. and so, dorothy, the scarecrow, and the tin man set off down the yellow-brick road.  dorothy, the scarecrow, and the tin man walked through a jungle and met a lion. ""where are you off to?"" asked the lion. ""i'm off to see the wizard to see if he can take me back to kansas,"" said dorothy. ""and to see if he can give me a brain,"" added the scarecrow. ""and to see if he can give me a heart,"" added the tin man.  ""do you think he can give me courage?"" asked the lion. ""i suppose,"" replied dorothy. and so, dorothy, the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion set off down the yellow-brick road.  finally, dorothy, the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion arrived at the emerald city and met the wizard. ""what brings you here?"" asked the wizard. ""i came here to see if you can take me back to kansas,"" said dorothy. ""and to see if you can give me a brain,"" added the scarecrow. ""and to see if you can give me a heart,"" added the tin man. ""and to see if you can give me courage,"" added the lion.  the wizard transported them all back to kansas. ""hey!"" said dorothy. ""only i wanted to go back to kansas! what about the other three?""  the wizard turned to the scarecrow, the tin man, and the lion. ""this is the united states, where you don't need a brain, a heart, or courage,"" he said.  and thus began three successful political careers."	1

""itâs a great magic dildo""  laughing, he says ""yeah right, great magic dildo my ass."""	1

three men are travelling home on christmas day together as they round a corner their car goes head on into a tree and the three men are instantly killed. all three men arrive at the pearly gates at the same time and stand in a long queue waiting to receive st peterâs judgement. while waiting, one of the men points ahead to front of the queue after noticing that some people are being asked to stand to one side rather than being directed to heaven or hell. the men discuss how the people look extremely frustrated and are deep in thought thinking of something. when the three men get close enough o the group one of them asks the person nearest Â  âwhy is it you are being put to one side? why are you not going to heaven or hell?â Â  â st peter has declared that as it is christmas day and a day for happiness and festive cheer, that rather than judge everyone on whether they led a good or bad life, he will admit you to heaven if you can give an example of something christmassy. but the catch is you can only use items that were on you when you perishedâ. â the reason that we are stood here is that st peter has declared that in the spirit (â¦) of christmas he will give us 2 chances. hence we are over here wracking our brains for some kind example of christmasâ Â  the men step back in line and immediately start discussing between them selves what they can possibly use to demonstrate an element of christmas. Â  when they get to the front of the queue they stand one by one in front of st peter Â  âto gain entry to heaven on this holy day you must demonstrate to me an example of christmas spiritâ demands st peter Â  the first man steps forward and rummages through his coat pockets and pulls out a lighter. Â  holding it alight the man says âthis flame represents the lighting of candles at christmas day massâ Â  st peter considers this for a second and says, âitâs a stretch but i shall grant you entry to heavenâ Â  the gates open and the man joyfully runs up the stairway to heaven. Â  the second man, feeling more confident having seen this, pulls out his car keys. he holds them aloft and starts jangling the keys. Â  âthese jangling keys represent the bells of st nicholasâ sleigh as he delivers presents to the childrenâ Â  st peter laughs at the thought but again grants access to heaven to the second man. Â  the third man is now stood in front of st peter and is rummaging around his pockets looking more and more desperate as he tries to find something. eventually checking his back pocket he pulls out a lacey red thong which he kept from a one night stand. Â  st peter steps back and says â how on earth are you going to explain that those ladies undergarments represent christmas?!â Â  the third man simply replies, âtheyâre carolâsâ	1

"bob goes to the zoo one day, bob decided to go to the zoo.  when he got to the ape cage, he found himself looking at a big male ape, who was staring right back at him.  when he scratched his head, so did the ape.    noticing this, bob decided to have some fun.  so he started to scratch under his arms and jump around saying ""ooooh oooh oooh"" and so did the ape.    stopping to think about what to do next, bob scratched his chin, as he was thinking.  before he could even react, the ape pulled the bars of his cage apart, jumped the moat, and proceeded to beat the ever living shit out of him,  a few weeks later, bob comes to in a hospital room, in full traction.  when they realized that he was awake, the staff brought a man into his room, and left the two of them alone.  ""mr. smith, my name is albert.  i am the zookeeper and i want to see if we can figure out what happened before you were attacked.""  ""i....don't know.  i was looking at the ape, and noticed he was mimicking my movements.""  ""i need to know exactly what you did.""  ""well, when i first noticed it, i was scratching my head.  when i noticed he was scratching his head, i started to play around, and i started to scratch my underarms and make oooh sounds.""  ""ok, then what happened?""  ""well, i was trying to think of something else to do, and i think i scratched my chin, which is the last thing i remember.""  ""you scratched you chin???   oh that explains everything!  you see, in ape, that means 'go fuck yourself'.  thank god, because if the attack was unprovoked, we'd have to shoot him.""  so the zookeper left bob to sit in traction for another six months, and if you've ever been in a cast, you can only imagine the misery of six months of not being able to move, shit or pee, or even get to that one itch, without someone elses help.  it wears on a man.  so bob spent all that time coming up with a plan to get his revenge on that damned ape.  he's finally released from the hospital, and makes his first trip to the local butcher, where he buys a giant polish sausage, and a pair of nice new butcher knives.    he then goes straight to the zoo, and marches up to the ape cage, where he is soon standing face to face with his attacker.  ""remember me?"" he asked as he got the apes attention, and saw that he was once again mimicking him.  he smiled and reached into his bag, and tossed a butcher knife into the apes cage.    when the ape picked it up, bob got his attention, by holding his own knife high, while he reached into his pants, and pulled the polish sausage out through the fly.  just as he expected, the ape mimicked him, holding his knife high, and his junk in his other hand.  seeing this, bob sliced down with his big butcher knife, cleanly cutting the polish sausage in half.   seeing the sausage laying on the ground, he looked up smugly to see how much pain the poor dumb ape must be in right now... where he saw him standing there, scratching his chin."	1

""wait. how about, you only have to give me five dollars if you don't know. but if i don't know i give you 5,000 dollars."" the lawyer said, very confident in his abilities.   ""okay... what goes up a hill with 2 legs, and comes back down with 10?"" the plumbers ask.    the lawyer thinks about it for around ten minutes then sighs,   ""i don't know."" he opens his briefcase and takes out the 5,000 dollars.   the plumber grabs the money and stands up,   ""this is my stop.""   ""before you go,"" the lawyer says, ""what was the answer?""   the plumber smiles at him, pulls out his wallet and hands him 5 dollars.        edit: spelling"	1

"the gunny's gun (a military joke)... u.s. armed services recruiting efforts are slipping. they've advertised, offered college money, granted large bonuses to new recruits... all to no avail.  so, the joint chiefs of staff all get together one day at a tavern in washington d.c. to brainstorm a solution. after many hours of back and forth conversation, they finally settle on their solution:  the department of defense will finance a netflix special where the most decorated member of each service is called to the filming location for a little contest. each member will be awarded $1,000 for every centimeter between body parts, and they can choose which body parts.  the day of the filming is here. the judges and the official measuring-tape private first class stand in front of the highest decorated air force member, a captain. the air force captain sticks his hands out to each side, with flat palms facing downward. the measuring-tape private first class stretches the measuring tape from middle finger-tip to middle finger-tip. the length is recorded as 154 cm and the captain quickly receives a check for $154,000 along with several ""thank you for your service"" handshakes.  the navy is next; a rear admiral this time. he decides to stick his arm straight up in the air and measure from his toe to his raised hand. the measuring-tape private first class stretches out the measuring tape and records 182 cm. the admiral then receives a check for $182,000.  it's now army's turn. the highest decorated soldier is a sergeant major, of equal height to the admiral. the sergeant major chooses the same measurement as the sailor before him, but instead of standing with his arm straight up in the air, he strikes a pose that resembles john travolta's signature move in saturday night fever. he manages to lump on an extra 13 cm, resulting in a check for $195,000.  aaaand finally... it's the marine corps' turn. the branch's highest decorated marine is a crusty, salty dog of a gunnery sergeant at least a foot taller than the other servicemen. with a face resembling an english bulldog, the gunny says loud and clear, ""from the tip of my dick, to my balls.""  everyone laughs, the joint chiefs make fun of the devil dog, claiming that ""even if he has a huge johnson, he'll still get less money. what a crayon-eating dumbass!"" the host asks the marine if he might consider changing his mind... but the gunny sticks to his selection.  so, the marine drops his trousers and the measuring-tape private first class kneels down to measure. but he doesn't move. the marine confidently asks, ""what's the matter, private? forget how to read numbers?""  ""no, gunny. but...... where... are your balls?"" replies the confused measuring-tape private first class.  without missing a beat, the marine corps gunnery sergeant says, ""oh, about 20 miles south of baghdad, give or take."""	1

thereâs a blond, redhead, and brunette stranded on a magic cliff. this cliff is magical because when you jump off, you can become anything you say.    the three girls want to escape so the brunette jumps off and yells, âpaper airplane!â  she turns into one and flies away.    the redhead jumps off and says, âbird!â  she becomes a red bird and flies away.  the blond has had a lot of time to think about her transformation, so she starts running toward the edge of the cliff.  when she gets to the edge, she trips and falls over the cliff screaming âoh shit!â  (this is my first ever post, so pls give some feedback so i can improve!)

"a young blonde girl in her late teens, wanting to earn some extra money for the summer, decided to hire herself out as a ""handy woman"" and started canvassing a nearby well-to-do neighborhood.  she went to the front door of the first house and asked the owner if he had    any odd jobs for her to do. ""well, i guess i could use somebody to paint the    porch"" he said.  ""how much will you charge me?""     delighted, the girl quickly responded,    ""how about $50?""      the man agreed and told her that the paint and brushes and everything she would need were in the garage.      the man's wife, hearing the conversation, said to her husband, ""does     she realize that our porch goes all the way around the house?""      ""that's a bit cynical, isn't it?"" he responded.      the wife replied, ""you're right. i guess i'm starting to believe all those    dumb blonde jokes.""      a few hours later the blonde came to the door to collect her money.      ""you're finished already??"" the startled husband asked.      ""yes,"" the blonde replied, ""and i even had paint left over so i gave it two    coats.""      impressed, the man reached into his pocket for the $50 and handed it to her along with a $10 tip.      ""thank you,"" the blonde said, ""and, by the way, it's not a porch,     it's a lexus..."	1
[nsfw] a joke my dad told me  (repost with edits (i was the original poster))  a young man wanted to buy a christmas present for his new girlfriend. they hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived  far away from him. he consulted with his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note... not too romantic and not too personal. off he went with his sister to the shops and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. his sister bought a pair of sexy knickers for herself at the same time. the shop had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and the man unknowingly got the knickers. he sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter.  dear maggie  i chose these because i've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. if it had not been for my sister i would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). these are a very delicate shade, but the lady i bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and i hardly noticed any marks. i had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. she also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. in fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them.  i wish i was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before i have a chance to see you again. when you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing. just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year. i hope you will wear them for me on our next date. all my love, patrick  p.s. my mum tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.	1

probably a blonde! a woman decides to have a face lift for her 50th birthday. she spends $15,000 and looks sensational.  on her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper. before leaving, she says to the clerk, âi hope you donât mind my asking, but how old do you think i am?â.  âabout 32,â is the reply.â  ânope! iâm exactly 50,â the woman says happily.  a little while later she goes into mcdonaldâs and asks the counter girl the very same question.  the girl replies, âiâd guess about 29.â the woman replies with a big smile, ânope, iâm 50.â  now sheâs feeling really good about herself. she stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.  she goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.  the clerk responds, âoh, iâd say 30.â  again she proudly responds, âiâm 50, but thank you!â  while waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.  he replies, âlady, iâm 78 and my eyesight is going. although, when i was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. it sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra then, and only then i can tell you exactly how old you are.â  they wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. she finally blurts out, âwhat the hell, go ahead.â  he slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. he bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. he pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.  after a couple of minutes of this, she says, âokay, okay.....how old am i?â  he completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, âmadam, you are 50.â  stunned and amazed, the woman says, âthat was incredible, how could you tell?â  âi was behind you at mcdonaldsâ.	1

""something for this, i have."" yoda says again. once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.  yoda and luke return to yoda's home, where yoda looks through his bag. he's used all his forks but one, he discovers.  ""that's ok master."" luke says, wanting to be helpful. ""i'll write us a note reminding us to buy more.""  so he writes the note and uses the very last fork to  pin it to the bulletin board.  he looks down at yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.  ""master yoda!"" he asks. ""what did i do wrong?""  yoda replies sagely, âa jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. never for a tack!"""	1

"a rather attractive woman goes up to the bar in a quiet rural pub. she gestures alluringly to the barman who comes over immediately. when he arrives, she gently steps with her high heels on the bar stool and plops herself on the bar top, crosses her legs, and seductively signals that he should bring his face close to hers. when he does so, she begins to gently caress his beard which is full and bushy.  are you the manager?"" she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands. ""actually, no"" he replies. ""can you get him for me - i need to speak to him?"" she asks, running her hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. ""i'm afraid i can't"" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. ""is there anything i can do?"" ""yes there is. i need you to give him a message"" she continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently.

the aduit    the irs decided to audit grandpa, and summoned him to the irs office. the irs auditor was not surprised when grandpa showed up with his attorney.  the auditor said, âwell, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. iâm not sure the irs finds that believable.â  âiâm a great gambler, and i can prove it,â says grandpa. âhow about a demonstration?â  the auditor thinks for a moment and says, âok. go ahead.â   grandpa says, âiâll bet you a thousand dollars that i can bite my own eye.â  the auditor thinks a moment and says, âitâs a bet.â   grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. the auditorâs jaw drops.  grandpa says, ânow, iâll bet you two thousand dollars that i can bite my other eye.â  the auditor can tell grandpa isnât blind, so he takes the bet.   grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. the stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with grandpaâs attorney as a witness. he starts to get nervous.  âwant to go double or nothing?â grandpa asks. âiâll bet you six thousand dollars that i can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.â  the auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides thereâs no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.  grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he canât make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditorâs desk.  the auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. but grandpaâs attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.  âare you ok?â the auditor asks.   ânot really,â says the attorney. âthis morning, when grandpa told me heâd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that youâd be happy about it.â	1

"a couple had been happily married for years. the only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke. the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.  every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. he told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. she told him to see a doctor; she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.  the years went by and he continued to rip them out! then one thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.  she took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.  some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.  the wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! after years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.  about twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. she bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter.  he said, ""honey, you were right. all these years you warned me and i didn't listen to you.""  ""what do you mean?"" asked his wife.  ""well, you always told me that one day i would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. but by the grace of god and some vaseline, i think i got most of them back in."""	1

""ah, it's a little game we got 'ere"" says the barman. ""it'll cost a tenner to hear the rules but if you pass three tests you get all the money in the jar.""  ""alright, i'm interested. what do i do?"" says the man, handing over a Â£10 note.  ""right. here's the rules - first off, you got to drink this whole bottle of tequila in one minute and keep a straight face the whole time.""  ""after that there's a pitbull out back and he's got a rotten tooth. you gotta get that tooth pit of his mouth without using any tools.""  ""and finally there's my great aunt irene upstairs. she's 102 years old, she's been bedridden and incontinent since 1962, and she's never had sex. you've got to go up there and pop her wrinkled, leathery cherry.""  the man is aghast. ""there's no way i could do all that! i'd barely make it out the door after that much tequila, let alone do the rest!""  ""that's up to you"" says the barman. ""but you paid to hear the rules, and i told you the rules, guess this tenner of yours will just have to go to someone who ain't afraid of a little challenge.""  so the man gets stuck into his pint, then another, and another... and eventually bravado gets the better of him.  ""right. gimme that bottle!"" he demands.  the barman hands him the bottle and the man tears the cap off, and he starts necking it. gulping it down and with tears streaming down his face, he fights the urge to grimace and somehow polishes it off in 50 seconds flat!  then he staggers towards the back door, to find the pitbull chained up to a pole. before long, everybody inside hears a cacophony of growling, crashing, screaming. and then, silence.  the silence is deafening. for a few long moments everybody fears the worst. suddenly, the door is kicked open and the man lurches back inside with his clothes ripped to shreds and soaked in blood. with a look of grim determination on his face he drunkenly slurs ""right- where's that old woman with the bad tooth then?"""	1

the saga of max mallory and mark kensington were two star struck lovers who had been married for 12 years. mallory was a commercial airline pilot and mark was the captain of a nuclear submarine. they were both very responsible with their money, lived simply, had no children, and no vices. the only exception to their frugality was their dog max whom they doted on at every possible occasion.   unfortunately for max, fate had terrible plans in store for him. one dark august day, mallory and mark were both at their respective jobs and in a cruel twist of fate suffered major mechanical failures at the same time. in a million to one oddity, they both perished in the astonishing first-of-its-kind airplane/submarine accident.  the funeral was a simple affair, but it was the reading of the will that shocked the attendees; everything they owned had been left to max. the kensington family was understandably upset about this, and within a few months time, the lawyers had finagled their way through to screwing max over with little thought to his feelings. shortly thereafter, unloved, unwanted, and aloneâ¦ max had been cast out onto the streets of new york penniless. as you can imagine, this was a real hardship for max.  max, destitute, wandered for weeks before he finally settled down on the corner of 5th and main. he found a âcomfortableâ cardboard box to live in, and his friend hobo jones was relatively sane. now for max, this whole new life was a real hardship, and difficult to adjust to butâ¦ he persevered. a few months later, while talking to hobo jones, he learned that there was a dog show in town. while an unattended dog at a show may be slightly unusual, max thought it just might be possible for him to improve his lot in lifeâ¦ there was a cash prize!  at the dog show, max was suitably impressive. he had bathed in the local gutter with hobo jonesâ help, and positively glowed with a hint of the radiance that he once had under the care of the kensingtons. the judges muttered among themselves every time they saw him and to a man they decided to award max first place.   ecstatic, max approached the judgesâ panel. unfortunately, dog show judges arenât the most scrupulous of people, and they kept the money, only giving max his trophy. what dog can complain about being cheated? faced with yet another hardship, max lugged his trophy home, whilst the judges had a wild night on the town with the cash that was supposed to go to the winner.  hobo jones comforted max when he got back. âmax, itâs ok. i know you got screwed, but hey you got this really neat trophy and at least youâre qualified for the city-wide dog show! maybe the judges will be better there, and you can really move up.â  max considered this good advice, and while his hardships seemed overwhelming at times, hobo jones had made a fair point. for the next month, max trained himself like never before. he exercised regularly, worked his fur into a grand sheen, and all around just persevered. the day of the city-wide show came around and he was excited. he trotted down to the performance hall, and quickly impressed everyone in attendance. by time the second round of judging had occurred, he was considered a favorite to win, and by the final round of judging, he was the clear victor. ecstatic, he rushed to claim his prize.  i donât wish to dishearten you or cast a pallor on the integrity of dog show judges everywhere butâ¦ max was just cursed by hardships. the judges at this particular show were, if anything, more corrupt than the previous judges. max received his trophy, and accolades rang from all but the cash was sadly lacking. these judges liked vegas more than they liked dogs, and the prize money that no human could claim would get them there in style. max, heartbroken, trudged home through the pouring rain dragging his (rather large) trophy behind him.  to the rescue came hobo jones. maxâs distressed demeanor was lightened by his antics and encouragement. after all, it was true that he had qualified for the state championships. besides, max was practically creating a name for himself in the dog show worldâ¦ two overwhelming victories with no owner? almost preposterous! so, that night, max curled up around his two trophies and considered that maybe his hardships were coming to an end. he wagged his tail a bit before he fell asleep.  this same sorry state of affairs continued for max through state, regional and even the national dog show. when max had just won the national dog show, he should have been living the good life, the $10,000 prize would have bought him quite a bit of comfort. unfortunately, plagued by hardships and corrupt judges, max had nothing but his five trophies to keep him warm at night. with a frustrated shake of his head, max decided to simply focus on how he would get to the international dog show in paris at the end of the year. he decided to see if he could get passage on a ship.  after spending an entire day begging every captain he met on the pier to take him along, max was beginning to despair. nobody seemed to want a dog underfoot, regardless of how useful he may be. luckily though, he decided to try one last ship. it was an old thing, and looked like it had come straight out of a story book. it was a ship that had clearly seen better days, and was in fact astonishing for itâs incongruity amongst other more modern shipsâ¦ it even had sails! max trotted up to the grizzled old sea captain and bade him good afternoon. astonishingly, maxâs luck seemed to take a turn right away for the captain immediately lit up and started chatting like they had been old friends his whole life. within an hour, max had secured passage to paris (provided he work during transit) and had found a new friend.  the following morning, max took his leave of hobo jones and boarded the ship. for many months they sailed and had many grand adventures, but this story is not about those. suffice it to say that the captain and max grew very fond of one another, and they shared many stories of hardships that each at faced. when they finally reached paris, the captain promised to wait for max, and wished him good luck at the show. this was it! the international dog show that max had been preparing for for so many months. he strutted in confidently and was greeted with uproarious applauseâ¦ he was practically famous now! the dog with no owner, the champion extraordinaire. round after round of judging, dog after dog was eliminated. finally, it came down to just two dogs, max and another yorkshire named augustus winthrop the third.   the judges whispered amongst themselves for an eternity. as you well know, the prize for the international dog show is nothing to sneeze at. it well exceeds thousands of pounds, and could set all of maxâs hardships aside for the duration of his life. unfortunately, human greed being what it is and maxâs lack of human company being what it wasâ¦ he never had a chance. with yet another cruel laugh from the fates, the judges awarded max the title of champion dog, the trophy, the accolades, andâ¦ not the money. max faced with yet another hardship, lugged the huge trophy back to the ship, and sadly went to his bunk. tired out, and depressed, he promptly fell asleep. the captain, knowing what had occurred the moment he saw max arrive, decided to leave immediately and cursed the judges heartily as they sailed out of port.  several hours later, a freak storm blew up. sailors were cursing, the captain was wide-eyed with stress, and max was awoken by the noise. he scampered to deck just in time to notice a sailor caught in the rigging trying to bring down one of the sails. without pausing a moment to think, max bounded up the rigging and immediately helped the sailor free, chewing through the ropes that had ensnared him. he let the sailor down first and was about to follow suit when a sudden wave rocked the ship violently and the worst happened. max lost his grip.  max fell.  max hit the deck.  max didnât move.  in one of those weird little moments of life, the sudden fury of the world paused. the sailors all gasped, shocked. the captain turned his eyes towards max. nobody moved. nothing moved. they all prayed silently for the poor dog, hoping against hope that he would rise once more. the spell was broken by the first mate who took a step forward, then another, anotherâ¦ tears were appearing in his eyes. then, miracle of miraclesâ¦ max got up. he was fine! the sailors all cheered, shouting for joy.   the first mate, astonished, turned to the captain and said, âcaptain, how could max survive a fall like that?â  âdonât you know?â said the captain, unsurprised in the least, âhe was used to hard ships.â	1

""what! are you saying i'm dead? i don't want to die! i'm too    young,"" said tom. ""i want you to send me back immediately.""      ""it's not that easy"", said st.peter. ""you can only return as    a dog or a hen. the choice is your own.""      tom thought about it for a while, and figured out that being    a dog is too tiring, but a hen probably has a nice and    relaxed life. running around with a rooster can't be that bad.      ""i want to return as a hen,"" tom replied.      and in the next second, he found himself in a chicken run,    really nicely feathered. but now he felt like his rear end    was gonna blow. then along came the rooster.      ""hey, you must be the new hen st. peter told me about,"" he    said. ""how do you like being a hen?""      ""well, ok i guess, but it feels like my ass is about to    explode.""      ""oh that!"" said the rooster. ""that's only the ovulation going    on. you need to lay an egg.""      ""how do i do that?"" tom asked.      ""cluck twice, and then you push all you can.""      tom clucked twice and pushed more than he was good for, and    then 'plop' an egg was on the ground.      ""wow"" tom said. ""that felt really good!"" so he clucked again    and squeezed. and you better believe that there was yet    another egg on the ground. the third time he clucked, he    heard his wife shout:      ""tom, for christ's sake! wake up! you're shitting all over    the bed!"""	1

"a scary midnight story a taxi driver is going home at midnight when he decides to take a shortcut through a cemetery. he's driving slowly through the dark when he suddenly stops in shock. in front of his headlights is a lady in white hailing him down.   before he has time to think, the woman climbs in and says in a low whisper, ""i'm so glad you're here. nobody ever goes by here anymore.""  there's something really creepy about the lady, and the cabbie doesn't talk with her, just drives to the address she gives. he's so nervous and jittery that he starts swerving hard along the country roads.  embarrassed that he's so scared, he turns around to apologize for his driving-- but the woman is gone.   terrified, the cabbie floors it until his heart stops beating like a jackhammer, and he catches his breath at a stop sign.   starting to think it was all a dream, he looks back to make sure no one is in his car. but he sees the woman in white again. this time, her eyes are dripping blood, and she starts to reach out to him with a pale hand.   this starts the cabbie again and he drives like a lunatic, not knowing what he's doing in his fright. he turns to see if the lady is close, and then hits the brakes-- she's gone again!   shaking, he pulls a flask and takes a swig of whiskey to steady his nerves, when cold fingers touch his shoulder. he looks behind him and sees the woman's face completely covered with blood now, staring down at him behind a veil of disheveled black hair.   the cabbie panics and drives like a madman, his only instinct is to escape. when he finally calms down, he stops and looks behind him to see that the lady has disappeared again. but as soon as he turns back toward the road, he notices that the lady is now seated beside him in the front passenger seat, blood covering her from head to toe and dripping from her open mouth.   crazed with fear now, the woman staring him down, the cabbie drives the final stretch to their destination like hell on wheels. when they get there, he collapses back into his seat, all the fight gone out of him.   the blood-covered lady leans over and whispers, in a creaking voice from the edge of the afterlife, saying,   ""hey, cabbie. you gotta fix that back door, i fell out and had to catch up to you three times."""	1

'miss beatrice', he said, 'i wonder if you would tell me about this?' pointing to the bowl..   'oh, yes,' she replied, 'isn't it wonderful? i was walking through the park a few months ago and i found this little package on the ground.  the directions said to place it on the organ, keep it wet and that it would prevent the spread of disease.  do you know i haven't had the flu all winter!	1

"a young man wants to become a lumberjack, so he goes to the forest and starts chopping. after a few days of doing this, he realizes he is simply not fit for this type of job. on his final day of trying to chop down trees, he notices an old scrawny man chopping down trees as if he was a woodpecker, the amount of hits he made grew more and more each swing. the first swing was one hit, the next, ten hits, the next one, a hundred hits, and the next one after that, a thousand. he kept swinging until the tree he was swinging at was chopped down. amazed, the young man walks over to the old man and asks, ""sir, what is your secret, how do you chop them down so quickly?""  the old man turns and says, ""it's all about the rhythm."" puzzled by the old man's answer, the young man returned home pondering what he said.  the next morning, he was motivated to keep trying to be a lumberjack. ""if an old scrawny man can do it, so can i!"" he thought.   so he went back to the forest, and tried to use his advice. trying to time each swing, he realizes this simply doesn't work. later in the day, he sees the old man again, comes up to him, and asks, ""i tried to time my swings, but it does no more than just chopping normally. how do you do it?""  ""you can't just make up any old rhythm and follow it, you have to find a very specific one,"" he says,  ""you have to find the logger-rhythm."""	1

so thereâs a farm. on this farm, thereâs a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends.      they do just about everything together. and one day, theyâre sitting at the window of the house, and the farmerâs kid is watching mtv, and theyâre watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says âyou know what? iâm gonna learn how to do that.â      so the horse calls up guitar center, and he says to the guy on the phone, âhey, listen. i wanna learn to play guitar.â      guy on the phone says âno problem. come on down.â      âno, there might be one problem. iâm a horse.â      ânaw, it ainât a problem. weâll get some attachments, i can teach you to play. promise.â      so horse turns out to be a natural. he gets good. and he calls over cow and chicken and heâs like âlook what i can doâ and he jams out like jimi hendrix. and cow says âholy shit. thatâs awesome. i want to learn to do something like that too. whatâs like that?â and horse says âbass. learn to play bass.â      so cow calls up guitar center, and she says âhey, listen, i wanna learn to play bass guitar.â      guy on the phone says âno problem, miss, come on down.â      âeh, this might be a problem. iâm a cow.â      ânah, no problem. i helped a horse recently, i can teach you to play too. promise.â      so cow learns to play the bass, and cow is fucking amazing at it. so cow and horse are jamming, and chicken gets a bit jealous. he says âdamn, i wanna learn something too. but not like that.â      horse says âwell, i mean, we need a drummer around here.â      so chicken calls up guitar center, and he says âhey, listen, i wanna learn to play drums.â      guy on the phone says âno problem, man. come on down.â      âeh, maybe a problem. iâm a chicken.â      ânaw. ainât no thing. i taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. i can teach you drums.â      so chicken learns the drums, and heâs fucking amazing. so cow, horse, and chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmerâs out. and one day theyâre playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. and he hears them, and heâs like âwhat the fuck? that sounds amazing.â so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. and he says âholy shit. you guys sound awesome. i wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. youâre gonna be huge.â      so cow and chicken and horse take this guyâs deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and theyâre big. real big. top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. they get set for their first tour. but thereâs a problem, see. horse gets a phone call, his momâs real sick. cow and chicken, though, theyâre cool as hell. they say âlisten. go see your mom. weâll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us.â      horse says âthanks, guys. youâre the best,â and he takes off.      couple of days later, horseâs mom is just fine. turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. the following morning, he gets a call. itâs his agent. cow and chickenâs plane went down, they died in the crash. the band is done. heâs lost his best friends. and horse, this breaks him, man. heâs been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. so he takes a walk, and while heâs on that walk, he just canât shake the blue, so he figures to himself âalright, alright. one drink, just to get over it.â      so horse walks into the local bar. bartender looks at him and says âhey. why the long face?â	1

the three babies an englishman, welshman and a jamaican are in hospital waiting for their wives to give birth. after much pacing up and down, the nurse emerges from the maternity ward and announces that each are the father to a bouncing baby boy.  âunfortunately thereâs just one small problemâ she adds. âbecause they were all born at the same time we got the tags mixed up and donât know which baby belongs to which parent. would you mind identifying them?â. the three men agree and go into the delivery room to look at the babies. immediately the englishman picks up the black baby. âyes, this is definitely my babyâ he says confidently.  âer, excuse meâ says the jamaican âbut i think itâs obvious that this is my son.â  the englishman pulls him aside and says, âi see where youâre coming from, mate, but one of these babies is welsh and iâm not prepared to gambleâ.	1

""we could live for a thousand years  but if i hurt you i'd make wine from your tears""  the crowd went nuts!  ""mystify  mystify me mystify mystify me""  the crowd were having the time of their life but we're dying to know who the band was.  a man decides to go to the barman: ""i'll buy you a drink if you tell me who they are"" the barman shook his head.  another man tries: ""listen, i'll get you a drink, and you can have my car for a day, hows about it?"" the barman again shook his head.  a woman decides to take up the challenge: ""you can have me, and my twin sister for the night, if you just tell us who they areeeee"" the barman politely declined.   for the rest of the night people focused more on finding who the band was then on the actual band. the barman was getting fed up.  finally a man tries his luck, sure of his deal: ""listen pal, you can have my car for a week, my wife for a day, my house for a month, my job if you want it. market shares? yours. these d&g shoes, my wife's valentino heels, my butler will do your bidding and any single item from my house you choose.  the barman was much past boiling point now.

""sir, i cannot do this.""    the dalai lama laughs and says,   ""i will give you two weeks more.""   then he leaves.   two weeks later, the man is exhausted.  charts and chalkboards are filled out and thrown around the room.  he has textbooks littered everywhere from him researching physics, chemistry, any other subject he can think of that might give a hint to an answer.  alas, the man finds none.  the dalai lama laughs and tells the man that in one month, he will return again.   another month passes, the dalai lama is walking to the house when he sees the man on his porch, smoking a cigar, drinking a scotch, and chuckling when he sees the man who gave him the duck and bottle close to two months prior.   the dalai lama looks at him and smiles.    ""i see you found the answer, my child?""  the man grins and yells,  ""not my duck, not my bottle, not my fucking problem!"""	1

""cathy,"" he asked his wife, ""would you do me a favor?  dress up in my uniform, smear your face, put on my helmet and ride the pine for me today.  nobody will know, and i'm headed for the deer woods.""   cathy reluctantly agreed, and sure enough no one knew sammy wasn't there.  the first three quarters of the game were uneventful, but in the fourth quarter sammy's team suffered a rash of serious injuries.  with no one left on the bench, the coach yelled, ""sammy, get in there!""   trembling, cathy ran onto the field, crouched down at the line of scrimmage and was knocked cold just after the ball was snapped.  when she came to, the coach had a handful of tit in one hand and was vigorously massaging her pussy with the other.   ""don't worry, sammy"" he said nervously.  ""once we get your balls back in place, your dick'll pop right up!"""	1

"the terrible legend of bahuda three explorers are making their way through a one of those generic jungles that always shows up in these sorts of jokes, when they are suddenly ambushed by a tribe of massive cannibals. (that's ""massive"" in the sense that they are very large, although they are also particularly passionate about eating other humans.) they are immediately bound and carried back to a village â the explorers, i mean, not the cannibals â where they are presented to the chief.  ""you are very fortunate!"" the chief bellows (in perfect english, somehow), ""for tonight, you will be given a choice! you may choose to be eaten in a grand feast... or you may marry my beautiful daughter, bahuda!""  ""why can't bahuda marry one of the other cannibals?"" the second of the three explorers whispers.  ""shut up,"" hisses the first. then he clears his throat and addresses the chief. ""i will marry your daughter!""  a cheer goes up in the village, and every cannibal starts to chant ""bahuda! bahuda! bahuda!"" from a nearby hut, a truly gargantuan woman emerges, her muscly arms as broad as some of the nearby tree trunks. the first explorer is intimidated by the sight of her, but he goes through with the ceremony, being wed to her on the spot. the other two explorers are allowed to stay alive for the evening, in honor of the happy occasion.  that night, as the village grows quiet, the sounds of screaming, bones cracking, and decidedly ominous squishing fill the air... and the next morning, the two unwed explorers are brought before the chief again.  ""alas,"" he says, ""my gorgeous daughter, bahuda, was unexpectedly widowed during the night... so i shall present you with the same choice as before! you may choose to be eaten in a grand feast, or you may marry bahuda!""  the second explorer raises his hand. ""sorry,"" he says, ""but i'm still not clear on why bahuda can't marry one of the other cannibals.""  ""i heard 'bahuda' and 'marry' in that sentence,"" replies the chief, ""so i'm going to assume that you intend to wed her.""  ""okay..."" the second explorer mutters.  ""*excellent!*"" the chief exclaims. ""you shall be wed immediately!""  as it had before, a cheer goes up in the village, and every cannibal starts to chant ""bahuda! bahuda! bahuda!"" from within her hut, the imposing figure of bahuda appears, her balled-up fists as large as a man's head. the second explorer swallows nervously, but he goes through with the ceremony, and his remaining friend is allowed to stay alive for another day, if only to provide an impromptu best man's speech.  that night, as the village once more grows quiet, the sounds of shrieks, limbs being snapped, and not-at-all-reassuring crunches echo beneath the stars... and the next morning, the third explorer is yet again brought before the chief.  ""a grave misfortune has befallen this village,"" he says, ""and my impossibly alluring daughter, bahuda, has experienced a second widowing... so i shall present you with the same decision as i did your friends! you may choose to be eaten in a grand feast, or you may marry bahuda!"" he grins expectantly. ""i assume you will take the latter option.""  ""well, that's where you're wrong!"" the third explorer shouts back. ""haven't you heard that one in three men is gay?""  the chief considers this. ""i mean, bahuda is fairly manly.""  ""i don't care,"" replies the third explorer. ""i will die with my dignity. i choose death!""  a murmur ripples through the village, and the chief looks stunned. ""nobody... nobody has ever chosen death,"" he eventually answers. ""still, if that is your wish, so be it."" then he turns to face his tribe, raising his hands above his head. ""he has chosen death; death by bahuda!"""	1

"heaven or hell while walking down the street one day a corrupt senator (that may be redundant) was tragically hit by a car and died.  his soul arrives in heaven and is met by st. peter at the entrance.  ""welcome to heaven,"" says st.. peter. ""before you settle in, it seems there is a problem. we seldom see a high official around these parts, you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""  ""no problem, just let me in,"" says the senator.  ""well, i'd like to, but i have orders from the higher ups. what we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. then you can choose where to spend eternity.""  ""really? i've made up my mind. i want to be in heaven,"" says the senator.  ""i'm sorry, but we have our rules.""  and with that, st. peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell.  the doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course.  in the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.  everyone is very happy and in evening dress. they run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people.  they played a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and the finest champagne.  also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who is having a good time dancing and telling jokes.  they are all having such a good time that before the senator realizes it, it is time to go.  everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.  the elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens in heaven where st. peter is waiting for him, ""now it's time to visit heaven.â  so, 24 hours passed with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. they have a good time and before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and st. peter returns.  ""well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. now choose your eternity.""  the senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: ""well, i would never have said it before, i mean heaven has been delightful, but i think i would be better off in hell.""  so st. peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell...  now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. he sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls to the ground.  the devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders.  ""i don't understand,"" stammers the senator. ""yesterday i was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. what happened?""  the devil smiles at him and says,  ""yesterday we were campaigning,  today, you voted.."""	1

"a pathologist is teaching her class how to do autopsies the students are taken to the morgue and once in there they are shown the corpse of a dead man. the cadaver is bloated and old, several traumatic wounds are visible, its skin is pale and dried and the faint smell of chemicals and rot emanates from him.  ""to become a good pathologist you need to learn two lessons."" says the teacher, as she turns around the dead body and spreads his asscheeks.   ""the first lesson is to not be disgusted by the human body."" without flinching the teacher then pushes one of her fingers inside of the man's rectum and then licks it.  ""alright, now each one of you has to do it. if you can't you are failed.""  a couple of students flake and leave the morgue, the rest get in line and do as asked. one by one they proceed to push their index finger inside the dead man's rectum and then lick it. a few vomit as well.

"the swing bar jim's friends take him to a bar he hadn't been to before then. it was like any other joint, minus the oddly cheap booze, and the group of people huddled in the corner.  jim asks the bartender what they're doing, and he explains that they're having a ""swing"".   jim and his friends venture over to view the ritual, and see an old man sitting on a bar stool in the middle of the crowd, with a long line jutting from it. when asked what's going on, a woman from the group tells jim that everyone takes turns lugging the man upside his head, and whoever knocks him off the stool wins $50.   the old man looked very weathered, but sat up straight with a demanding presence.  jim wasn't very comfortable with the idea of hitting an old man, but his friends urged him on. after a good five minutes of waiting, it was his turn to swing. coyly, he threw a weak jab at the old man's cheek.   sensing his hesitation, the old man urged him to hit as hard as he could. so jim pulled his arm back once more, and propelled his fist violently into the old mans left temple, and he fell from the stool, the whole crowd silent with shock. then the crowd suddenly roared with cheering, joyous that someone had finally knocked the old man off of his throne.  the old man slowly pulled himself off the ground, and after dusting himself off, began reaching into his wallet to reward the jim with the promised payment, but before he could, he bet that jim  couldn't knock him down once more. jim was still uneasy about what he'd just done, but the encouragement from the crowd persuaded him to take the bet.   the old man sat himself back on the stool, and prepared for the blow to come. jim pulled back his hand, and like a plane from a runway, sent his fist into the old man's jaw. the sound was like the cracking of a whip, and it shook the souls of everyone in the bar. the old man hit the floor, throwing up the dust of the wooden boards. the crowd went ballistic, cheering for jim and his victory. the old man took a few minutes to stand back up, and was struck with confusion. after he finally regained his composure, he payed jim $100 for his double knockout and sat down at a table.  with his reward, jim bought the whole crowd a round of drinks, and had a great time the rest of the night.   that next weekend, jim and his friends were thinking of things to do. he proposed they return to the bar, and they did. when they entered, scattered cheers filled the room, eminating from some of those who viewed his show of strength a week earlier. and in the corner was the old man, back on his stool, another great crowd around him.  one thing led to another, and jim was in line to pummel the old man once more. when his turn had come, the old man sneered at him, proclaiming he had trained for this the past week, hoping jim would return to the bar. jim, uncaring of the old man's teases, swung and knocked the old man from his chair. he received his $50 and him and his friends spent it all on alcohol.  jim capitalized on his odd talent for punching the elderly and took his friends to the bar every weekend, almost never having to pay for their drinks, using his swing money instead. he grew to enjoy hitting the old man so much he would sometimes simply go to the bar by himself. he'd even go during the week, when the bar was less busy, so there was no punchline."	1

""will i be able to buy that dish?""  ""well it's not common as we require the prized bull and a bullfight, not to mention it's expensive and you'll have to preorder it.""  ""it's alright i'll wait don't worry about the money or anything i'll pay but i want that dish.""  and the deal was done.  a few days later he had the dish and he loved it. in fact he loved it so much he asked to see the chef  he said to the chef,"" i really loved the dish it was delicious thank you very much. although i have 1 question. that day when i saw the dish the balls were really big but today not so much, why is that?""  and the chef replied,"" well unfortunately sometimes the bull wins.""    note: if you're spanish pls don't b offended i also did some research and they do not eat human testicles. tho the bull testicles is true. dish is called criadillas if anyone's interested."	1

"a farmer takes a trip into town. he's a self sufficient guy so this is a rare occurrence, however finding himself low on essentials he decides there's nothing for it and heads in.  being something of a special occasion he takes his youngest child with him, thinking it was the perfect chance to show off his knowledge of the world outside to an eager audience. on the trip in, they chatter away until they arrive at their first stop, the bakery. pulling up, the little one excitedly asks where they are.  ""why this is john the baker, youngest. you see, when dad doesn't make any bread, john makes it for him."" the little one stares at him wide eyed and asks ""is it as good as yours?"" with a small grin he replies ""no, mine is better!"" and off he went to get the bread.   arriving at their next stop, the little one again queries where they are. ""why this is ted's liquor store, youngest. you see, when dad doesn't make any beer, ted makes it for him.""   the little one stares at him, thinking hard, and asks ""is it as good as yours?""  with a bigger grin he replies ""no, mine is better!"" and off he went to get some beer.  at their final stop, the butcher's shop, the little one thinks the world makes a lot more sense now. ""so then dad..."" his smallest child begins, and looks at him expectantly.   ""yes that's right little one. this is tom the butcher. and when dad hasn't made any sausages...."" he trails off.

""you're so stupid, i wish for all of the bears in the neighboring forests were female."" the genie granted the wish and then the bear made his last wish, ""now i wish that all the bears in all the forests in all of the world were female.""  the genie granted his last wish. then the rabbit pulled on his helmet and revved up his motorcycle and before he tore off into the sunset he pointed at the bear and said, ""i wish he was gay."""	1

'we must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances.' inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair... we need you to kill her' the man said, 'you can't be serious. i could never shoot my wife.' the agent said, 'then you're not the right man for this job. take your wife and go home.' the second man was given the same instructions. he took the gun and went into the room. all was quiet for about 5 minutes. the man came out with tears in his eyes, 'i tried, but i can't kill my wife.' the agent said, 'you don't have what it takes. take your wife home.' finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. he took the gun and went into the room. shots were heard, one after another. they heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. after a few minutes, all was quiet. the door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow.

"the broken grandfather clock a man once owned a beautiful grandfather clock (well, he probably still does, but let's put that aside for now). now, when i saw the grandfather clock was beautiful, i mean absolutely gorgeous. the clock stood nearly 6 feet tall, made from the most splendid mahogany wood, accompanied by intricate hand carved detailing. it was the kind of clock that makes one think ""wow, what a fine clock that is.""  but besides its incredible beauty, the grandfather clock was extremely valuable to the man for the heritage it represented. the clock had been in his family for generations, even surviving the trip from germany in 1939 when his great grandparents fled the nazis. so, you could imagine the man's utter dismay when the clock stopped working.  well, it stopped half working i should say. the clock would continue to tik, but it would not tok.  the man's first thought was to contact his father. his father had owned the clock before him, and was a carpenter by trade, so the father was rather good with his hands. the father, distraught by the news that the family grandfather clock had stopped working, came over right away and began looking at the clock to figure out the issue.  ""well, here's your problem,"" the father said. ""the clock can tik, but it won't tok.""  ""i know that, pa."" the man said irritably. ""can you fix it?""  unfortunately, the father could not. but the pair wouldn't give up there. the two contacted a local clock shop, who happened to employ a man who specialized in grandfather clocks. the father and son thought this would be perfect, and asked the shop to send the repairman over right away.  the repairman came over to the man's house and immediately set up examining the broken grandfather clock. he hmmed and hummed to himself for a while as he tinkered inside the clock.   ""i believe the problem is that the clock can tik, but it cannot tok."" the repairman said.  ""we already know that!"" the man and father said in unison. ""can you fix it?""  the repairman removed his hat rubbed the sweat from his brow. ""i'm afraid this clock is beyond me. it's an advanced design from germany, only the original designer and builder would have the skills to fix this.""  the situation seemed hopeless. how were they to track down a man in germany who had been building clocks since before the second world war? it was an impossible task, but the father and the son set out researching the clock and its origins.  after nearly a week, a breakthrough was made. as it turns out, the shop that had built the grandfather clock was still in business, owned by the man who had originally created their grandfather clock! they asked the german clocksmith if he would be willing to travel to take a look at their beloved clock.  ""i would be honored to fix your clock,"" the german said. ""it is not every day you get to see one of your original creations!""  so the german flew out to see the father and son and their old grandfather clock. the german arrived at their house, and upon seeing the grandfather clock his face lit up like he was 20 years younger.  ""oh my, she is beautiful!"" he exclaimed. ""you have certainly taken very good care of her. but, what seems to be the problem?""  ""the clock can tik, but it cannot tok.""  ""well now,"" the german said, turning towards the clock. ""we have ways of making you tok."""	1

""what's the matter today, honey?""   ""well you see, all through my life i've never been kissed""   so he gives her a kiss, she's happy again, and he goes on his way.  on the third day, the man sees her again and once again she's crying. getting sick of this he walks up to her and says   ""what's the matter today?""   she looks up at him sheepishly    ""well, all through my life... i've never been fucked.""   he thinks to himself for a moment...   ""okay"" he says and her eyes light up.   he picks the woman up and starts walking to the edge of the water and then hurls her into the ocean.   ""there, now you're fucked!"""	1

"a mathematician and a physicist were arguing over whose field of study was better. a mathematician and a physicist were arguing over whose field of study was better.  they decided to settle the argument by posing questions.  the mathematician went first, and posed a complicated mathematical problem.  with a great deal of effort, several books of mathematical tables and techniques, and a few hours, the physicist gave the solved problem to the mathematician, who was duly impressed.  ""all right, my turn.  here's the problem: you have a pot of water on the stove, at 60 f.  you want to heat it up to 70 f.  what do you do?"" the mathematician replied, ""oh, that's easy.  you turn the stove on.  fourier's equations govern how heat transfers from the stove to the pot, and you can solve them numerically to find out how long it takes for the water to reach 70 f."" the physicist then asks, ""all right, so what if the water's at 65 f?""  ""oh, that's even easier.  you take the pot of water, stick it in the refrigerator until it cools down to 60 f, and then it simplifies to the previous problem!"""	1

the only survivor of a shipwreck washes up on a deserted island heâs stranded alone on the island for over ten years surviving on coconuts and fish. one day heâs sitting on the beach thinking about life back home when a woman in a wetsuit and scuba gear stands up in the ocean and starts walking out of the surf, fins in hands. the man shakes his head and blinks his eyes trying to figure out if heâs dreaming. when he refocuses itâs like a scene from a movie: the woman has taken off her mask and is shaking out long hair, water droplets glinting in the afternoon sunlight.   he can tell sheâs stunning.   he sits there as she walks across the sand dropping her scuba gear as she goes. she stops standing in front him and says, âbeen here long mister?â he can only nod his head while he lols for his voice.   she laughs and asks, âyou smoke?â  he nods again and she unzips a dive bag and pulls out a pack of cigarettes and a lighter. she pops one in her mouth and lights it before handing it over for him to smoke. she lights one for herself and they smoke together in silence while he drinks in her beauty.   when theyâre done she asks, âyou drink?â  he nods again, still mute, and she pulls out a bottle of 20 year old scotch and two glasses. she pours a couple fingers of scotch in each and hands one to him before replacing the bottle of scotch and setting the dive bag aside. she sways seductively while humming as the drink the scotch together.   when both glasses are empty she smiles and takes his glass, setting both aside on the ground. standing up she starts unzipping the front of her wetsuit and asks, âyou want to have a little fun?â  the man stands up breathing heavily, eyes following the slowly descending zipper. he stutters, eyes wide as he finds his long unused voice and says, âyou mean to tell me youâve got golf clubs too?â	1

"a handsome man went into a hotel and asked to see the boss. when the boss came, the story began.  \\-client: is room 39 empty?   \\-boss: yes, sir.   \\-client: can i book it?   \\-boss: of course you can.   \\-client: thank you.    before going to the room, the client asked the boss to provide him with a black knife, a white thread 39 cm and an orange 73g.  the boss agreed though he was surprised at the weird things the client asked to have.  the client went into his room, he didn't ask for food or anything else.    unfortunately for the boss, his room was next to room 39.  after midnight, the boss heard strange voices and noise in that client's room. voices of wild animals and of utensils and dishes being thrown on the floor.  the boss didn't sleep that night. he kept thinking and wondering what might be the source of the noise.    n the morning, when the client handed the keys to the boss, the boss asked to see the room first.  he went to the room and found everything alright. nothing unusual. he even found the thread, the black knife and the orange on the table.  the client paid the bill and gave the bellboys a very good tip and left the hotel smiling.    the boss was in a shock but he didn't reveal what he heard to the bellboys. in fact, he started to doubt himself.    after one year, the client showed up again. he asked to see the boss again. the boss was in a puzzle.  the client asked the same things: room 39, black knife, white thread 39cm and an orange 73g.  this time, the boss wanted to know the truth by all means possible. he spent a sleepless night, waiting for something to happen. after midnight, the same voices and noises started, this time louder and more indecipherable than the year before.    again, before leaving, the client paid his bill and left a large tip on the table for the bellboys. the smile didn't leave his face.  the boss started searching for the meaning of everything the client asked to have. why did he ask room 39? why the white thread? why the black knife???  the boss didn't arrive to any convincing answer to all these questions.    the boss now was eagerly waiting for the month of march, the month in which the client showed up.  to his surprise, on the first day of march, the same client showed up. he asked the same questions. wanted to book the same room, wanted to have the same things as before.  the boss again heard the same noises, this time more louder than before.    in the morning, when the client was leaving the hotel, the boss apologized politely to the client and asked to know the secret behind the noises in the room.    \\-''if i tell you the secret, do you promise to never reveal it to anyone else?''   \\-''i promise i will never let anyone know''.   \\-''swear''   \\-''i swear i won't reveal your secret''   so finally, the client revealed his secret to the boss.   unfortunately, the boss was a sincere person. until now he hasn't revealed his secret to anyone.  when he does, i will let you know... thank you for reading.  &#x200b;  *(sorry if this has been posted before. my brother sent to me and i found it hilarious...)*"	1

new hr policy dear employee:  as a result of the reduced budget, we are forced to cut down on our number of personnel.     under this plan, older employees will be asked to take early retirement, thus permitting the retention of younger people who represent our future. therefore, a program to phase out older personnel by the end of the current fiscal year, via retirement, will be placed into effect immediately.  this program will be known as slap (sever late-aged personnel). employees who are slapped will be allowed to look for jobs outside the company.  slapped employees can request a review of their employment records before actual retirement takes place. this review phase is called screw (survey of capabilities of retired early workers). all workers who have been slapped and screwed may file an appeal with upper management. this appeal is called shaft (study by higher authority following termination).     under the terms of the new policy, an employee may be slapped once, screwed twice, but maybe shafted as many times as the company deems appropriate.     if an employee follows the above procedure, he/she will be entitled to get: herpes (half earnings for retired personnel's early severance) or clap (combined lump sum assistance payment).     as herpes and clap are considered benefit plans, any employee who has received these will no longer be slapped or screwed by the company.     the management wishes to assure the younger employees who remain on board that the company will continue its policy of training employees through our shit (special high-intensity training). we take pride in the amount of shit our employees receive. we have given our employees more shit than any company in this area.     if any employee feels that they do not receive enough shit on the job, see your immediate supervisor. your supervisor is specially trained to make sure that you receive all the shit that you can stand.  and, once again, thanks for all your years of service with us.	1

""aye, you show such kindness to me.  i will grant ye three wishes.""     ""t'is ok, i am already blessed enough as it is.  if you could kindly point me to my ball i will be on my way.""  the leprechaun pointed him to the ball, then said, under his breath ""ye refuse my wishes? i will give them to you me-self.  i wish ye great fortune, i wish ye great success at what you love, and i wish you a great love life!""  so a couple of years later, the man's back at the golf course, and the leprechaun goes to him.  ""aye! i see you are back.  how are things?""  ""well, it's funny you mention that.  i've been super busy.  my golf game suddenly turned around and got good enough that i'm now on the professional tour!""

""naw, it ain't a problem. we'll get some attachments, i can teach you to play. promise.""  so horse turns out to be a natural. he gets good. and he calls over cow and chicken and he's like ""look what i can do"" and he jams out like jimi hendrix. and cow says ""holy shit. that's awesome. i want to learn to do something like that too. what's like that?"" and horse says ""bass. learn to play bass.""  so cow calls up guitar center, and she says ""hey, listen, i wanna learn to play bass guitar.""  guy on the phone says ""no problem, miss, come on down.""

suite 103  the scotch wasnât going down easily today, but that didnât make pouring some more any more difficult for adam. the phone call he had received three days earlier kept replaying in his mind over and over again. she was out of town for a press conference. âi canât not go, honey. i was the lead designer for the prototype. who else is going to announce and describe its features?â adam never became too involved in alexaâs career. he was supportive, but the amount of time she spent away from home was anything but enjoyable for adam. adam was a retired homicide investigator, though his retirement was earlier than heâd have preferred. heâd known it would happen if he kept pursuing the case, but a double homicide on two children under the age of 10 was too much for adam to just âlet go.â during his investigation, he got in a bad way with some worse people and became too much of a liability for the department. retirement was the only option. the phone call thoughâ¦ the phone call changed everything. alexaâs assistant was in tears as she told him. adam couldnât suppress his despair when he found out his beloved wife was found with a gun in her hand and a bullet through her head in the company paid hotel suite: suite 103. adam was waiting. he was told that his arrest was inevitable if he interfered with the investigation. that wouldnât stop him from conducting his own once the unmotivated machine-men finished lazily going through their procedures. he arrived the next day at the hotel, and his hangover disappeared as soon as he walked through the doors. the hotel manager seemed to be giving him looks of disapproval as soon as he walked through the door, so unsurprisingly, he refused to allow adam into suite 103 since the investigation was over and had already deemed the death a suicide. adam knew alexa better than that. this wasnât a suicide no matter what the investigation seemed to reveal, and no bitter hotel manager with a big nose and a bigger stick up his ass would keep adam from finding out what really happened in that hotel suite. adam headed into a maintenance hallway and began watching the workers. they seemed to still be talking about the incident in suite 103. adam noticed one girl in particular: a blonde, around 22 years of age who he knew would have a wonderful smile if she allowed one to occupy her face. a smile seemed out of the question for her, though. she seemed to feel more uncomfortable talking about the âsuicideâ than the other workers, and upon learning she worked with the housekeeping staff, adam knew she was his way in. he waited for her to enter the restroom and seated himself close enough for her to notice him when she walked out, but far enough away to be covert about it. thinking about alexa was all adam needed for tears to begin streaming down his face. the blonde exited the restroom and stared at him for a bit before approaching him. âare you okay?â whispered the girl. âiâve had better days.â stuttered adam. while explaining his situation, adam learned the girlâs name was alexâa convenient coincidence as far as adam was concerned. alex had tears glistening in her eyes by the time adam was finished, and it was not difficult to convince her to help him. there were three conditions adam had to follow if he wanted to have access to suite 103: 1. he had to make his own copy of the key to the room. 2. alexâs involvement in helping him had to remain a secret no matter what. 3. adam had to only access the suite at evenfall for around half an hour each day, as that was the latest time he could enter without seeming suspicious, and shift changes of security personnel lasted around that long. adamâs first day in the suite didnât yield much. he noticed the bullet hole in the wall didnât make much sense with what he expected based on evidence from alexaâs head, but that was all speculation since adam didnât get to observe the initial investigation. over a period of nine days, adam visited suite 103 each day for a half hour. he noticed nothing that the investigation hadnât already revealed. he went home on day nine and thought that maybe he didnât know his wife as well as he thought he did. he tried to convince himself that his efforts werenât all for naught, but nothing seemed to support that idea. as he was drowning in those depressing thoughts, he realized that there was one thing he hadnât looked at. investigators avoid searching sheets and any other form of fabric for fingerprints because the material does not hold the prints like a glossy and hard surface does; however, that hotel room had a blanket over the comforter on the bed that was mainly there for aesthetic appeal. this blanket had some sort of glossy coating on it from what adam had observed when he removed it from the bed on day one. if there were one place from which someone wouldnât think to clean their fingerprints, that place would be on a blanket. adam couldnât wait for the next night. he grabbed his supplies for revealing prints and his key to the suite and rushed back to the hotel. he hurried through the doors and saw alex whose eyes widened upon seeing him. she vigorously shook her head, but adam ignored it and jogged to the suite, opening the door and entering. he began applying a powdery residue to the glossy blanket. the door swung open and the hotel managerâs silhouette came into view on the mirror in front of the door. âget out!â he screamed. adam knew he wouldnât be able to reason with the hotel manager, so he just kept searching the blanket for fingerprints. adam worked through the hotel manager calling the police and worked through the hotel managerâs constant screaming. sure enough, the blanket was covered in prints. prints from multiple people. prints from more people than were involved in his wifeâs death, but adam knew that some of them belonged to her killer. seconds after this revelation, adamâs arm was grasped firmly and he was handcuffed and brought to his feet. âno! my wife was killed! murdered! the killerâs prints are on that sheet! i know it!â the officers would not listen and they led adam to the doorway. adam walked away from his life and left his heart on that blanket. as the hotel room door closed, adam turned back toward the room as a single tear streamed down his cheek. emotion overwhelmed his voice as he opened his mouth and whispered, âgood night, suite prints.â	1

"jokes my grandpa told me when i was a kid. a man goes duck hunting and spends two days without seeing a duck. on the third day he finally sees one and shoots it. the duck wounded tries to fly away. it lands in a farmer's yard, hits the barn roof, and falls off.  the hunter tries to sneak over the fence. as he gets close to the duck, he sees the farmer turn the corner around the barn.  ""hey there, buddy... why are you in my yard?""  ""well i have been hunting for three days now and this is the first duck i have seen.""  ""well,"" says the farmer. ""that's my duck. it's in my yard.""  ""no way! i shot it, it's mine.""  ""you don't know about country laws here buddy. it's on my property it's my duck.""  ""if i hadn't shot it, it wouldn't be here!'  ""tells ya what... we'll settle this how we do in the country. we'll take turns kicking each other in the groin, until one of us gives up. but, i go first.""  the hunter agrees and the farmer kicks the hunter in the groin as hard as he can. the hunter falls to the ground screaming and writhing. after ten minutes the farmer is able to stand again. ""ok, my turn...""  the farmer waves his hand and says, ""ahh... you can keep it.""    a man hires some a few men to put sprinklers in his very large yard in august. two men start the trenching while one man sits under a large tree in the shade. after an hour, one of the men doing the trenching says to the other, ""hey man, why are we working so hard and sweating it out in the sun, and he is sitting in the shade?""  the other guy says ""i have no idea, it's not fair. go ask him who he thinks he is and why he isn't working.""  the first guy goes over to the guy in shade and asks, ""why aren't you working like we are? what makes you think you can sit here while we are killing ourselves?""  shade guy stands up and says, ""well, it's very simple. it's called sense.""  ""sense? i got sense!""  shade man says ""ok, lets see."" shade man turns and puts his hand against the tree and says, ""i bet you can't punch my hand.""  the other guy steps up and throws a punch, only to have shade man pulls his. the first guy hits the tree and starts screaming his pain doing the pain spins.  ""see, that's sense,"" says shade guy. ""i had the sense to pull my hand, you didn't have the sense to realize i would move my hand.""  shade man sits back down, and puts his head aginst the tree and closes his eyes. the first man walks back to the other man still shaking his hand.

notice is hereby given: **notice is hereby given:**  please be advised that anyone planning to dash through the snow in a one-horse open sleigh, going over the fields and laughing all the way are required to undergo a full risk assessment addressing the safety of open sleighs. this assessment must also consider whether it is appropriate to use only one horse for such a venture, particularly where there are multiple passengers.   please note that permission must also be obtained in writing from landowners before their fields may be entered.   to avoid offending those not participating in celebrations, we request that laughter is moderate only and not loud enough to be considered a noise nuisance and therefore must not occur after 11pm and before 7am.  benches, stools and orthopedic chairs are now available for collection by any shepherds planning or required to watch their flocks at night.  while provision has also been made for remote monitoring of flocks by cctv cameras from a centrally heated shepherd observation hut, all facility users are reminded that an emergency response plan must be submitted to account for known risks to the flocks.  the angel of the lord is additionally reminded that prior to shining his/her glory all around s/he must confirm that all shepherds are wearing appropriate personal protective equipment, including eye protection, to account for the harmful effects of uva, uvb and the overwhelming effects of glory.  following last yearâs well publicised case, everyone is advised that ec legislation prohibits any comment with regard to the ârednessâ of any part of mr. rudolph reindeer. further to this, exclusion of mr. rudolf reindeer from reindeer games will be considered discriminatory and disciplinary action will be taken against those found guilty of such an offence.  while it is acknowledged that gift-bearing is commonly practised in various parts of the world, everyone is reminded that the bearing of gifts is subject to hospitality guidelines and all gifts must be registered and where necessary, taxes and import duties paid as appropriate. this applies regardless of the individual -even royal personages.   it is particularly noted that direct gifts of currency or gold are specifically precluded under provisions of the foreign corrupt practices act. further, caution is advised regarding other common gifts, such as aromatic resins that may initiate allergic reactions.  finally, in the recent case of the infant found tucked up in a manger without any crib for a bed, social services and the local authority safeguarding board have been advised and will be fully investigating. the rspca are also seeking reassurance that no donkeys were harmed during this incident.  compliance of these guidelines is mandatory in order for you to fully participate with the festive spirit. wishing you a very merry christmas (but bear in mind this must be under 107 milligrams per 100 millilitres of urine or 35 microgrammes per 100 millilitres of breath if driving â uk, wales & northern ireland).   regards, the christmas regulatory & assessment panel (crap)	1

a group of guys were all turning 30... a group of guys were all turning 30, so they decided to go somewhere and celebrate. after some discussion, they finally settled on tj's tavern over in summersville, because the prices were good and it stayed open late.  ten years later, they were all turning 40, and they thought it might be fun to meet up somewhere again. after some discussion, they finally settled on tj's tavern over in summersville, because the waitresses were attractive and there was an excellent beer selection.  another decade passed, and they were all turning 50. to mark this milestone, they wanted to get together again somewhere. after some discussion, they finally settled on tj's tavern over in summersville, because the food was delicious and the service was fast and friendly.  ten more years rolled by. now they were all turning 60, and they wanted to continue their tradition of meeting up up somewhere for the occasion. after some discussion, they finally settled on tj's tavern over in summersville, because there was a great senior discount and plenty of parking.  after another ten years, they were all turning 70, and once again they began planning a reunion. after some discussion, they finally settled on tj's tavern over in summersville, because it was wheelchair-accessible and the restrooms were conveniently located.  yet another decade flew swiftly past. they were all turning 80, and wanted to go someplace particularly special to commemorate the event. after some discussion, they finally settled on tj's tavern over in summersville, because they'd never been there before.	1

a thug starts harassing a nun on a bus he's saying things to her like 'show me what's under that outfit' and 'i bet you're not wearing any underwear'. the nun is clearly uncomfortable and eventually clutches her bible to her chest and yells 'lord protect me' and gets off the bus at the next stop.     the thug starts yelling abuse at her as she hurries off down the road. the bus driver sees all this and looking around seeing it's an otherwise empty bus shouts 'hey bud! you wanna get with that nun? i know how!'. the thug walks to the front of the bus to the driver and is told that there's a costume shop a few stops away and if he hires out a wig and long beard, plus loincloth and sandals he can dress up as jesus. after late night mass at the local church, the nun will walk to the convent half a mile away down an alleyway that leads nowhere else so there will literally be nobody around. all the thug has to do is 'appear' as jesus and the nun would surely put-out.     so the driver lets the thug off a few stops later at the costume shop. later that night the thug jumps out of the bushes down the alley that leads to the convent and 'appears' to the nun. she's flabbergasted and drops to her knees proclaiming 'oh lord! oh lord! i have devoted my life to you and will do anything you ask'. so the thug says 'well, actually sister, i need to have sex with you right now as a sign of your love and devotion to your lord and saviour'. the nun stutters and says 'oh ...uhm... my lord i would love to but i am unlcean and not worthy of you, i am menstruating'. the thug thinking quickly says 'uhm .... but as it says in the bible, when one door closes another one shall open, so i shall take you from behind'. the nun seems to be placated by that and agrees!     the thug, being the total douchebag he is finishes off inside her after a fairly brutal and hard rear-entry session then almost immediately tears off the wig and beard and yells 'hahaha! i'm not really  jesus, i'm the guy from the bus!!!!!'. the nun then tears off her head dress and yells 'hahaha that's okay - i'm really the bus driver!'	1

a little idaho humor from john h. hill  a girl potato and boy potato had eyes for each other,  and finally they got married, and had a little sweet  potato, which they called 'yam'.  of course, they wanted the best for yam.  when it was time, they told her about the facts of life.  they warned her about going out and getting half-baked, so she wouldn't get accidentally mashed, and get a bad name for herself like 'hot potato,' and end up with a bunch of tater tots.  yam said not to worry, no spud would get her into the sack and make a rotten potato out of her!  but on the other hand she wouldn't stay home and become a couch potato either.  she would get plenty of exercise so as not to be skinny like her shoestring cousins.  when she went off to europe, mr. and mrs. potato told yam to watch out for the hard-boiled guys from ireland .  and the greasy guys from france called the french fries.  and when she went out west, to watch out for the indians so she wouldn't get scalloped.  yam said she would stay on the straight and narrow and wouldn't associate with those high class yukon golds, or the ones from the other side of the tracks who advertise their trade on all the trucks that say, 'frito lay.'  mr. and mrs. potato sent yam to idaho p.u. (that's potato university ) so that when she graduated she'd really be in the chips.  but in spite of all they did for her, one-day yam came home and announced she was going to marry tom brokaw.  tom brokaw!  mr. and mrs. potato were very upset.  they told yam she couldn't possibly marry tom brokaw  because he's just......  a commontater	1

"a woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon.    as she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. after a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""i'm sorry, your duck, cuddles, has passed away.""     the distressed woman wailed, ""are you sure?"" ""yes, i am sure. your duck is dead,"" replied the vet.. ""how can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""i mean you haven't done  any testing on him or anything. he might just be in a coma or  something.""     the vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. he returned  a few minutes later with a black labrador retriever. as the duck's  owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his  front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to  bottom. he then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.   the vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. a few  minutes later he returned with a cat. the cat jumped on the table and  also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. the cat sat back on  its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the  room.     the vet looked at the woman and said, ""i'm sorry, but as i said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""     the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..     the duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""     the vet shrugged, ""i'm sorry. if you had just taken my word for it,  the bill would have been $20, but with the lab report and   the cat scan, it's now $1,500."""	1

"the penis requested a wage raise from his company one day he presented the following arguments to justify his request:  ""dear board, i, as the penis, request a raise due to following reasons:  1. i work hard physically. 2. i always use my head in every job i do. 3. i work in both deep and superficial environments. 4. my working environment is very hot and no overtime is paid. 5. i work in dark and damp environments without any air. 6. i don't have any holidays, celebration leaves or annual vacations. 7. i have no social security despite the fact that i have a high risk of contracting a disease during work.   therefore, i kindly submit this request for your evaluation.""  the management board discussed his request and responded as such:  ""dear penis, we have assessed your request for a raise but unfortunately it is declined due to reasons listed below:  1. you cannot work for straight 8 hours without any pause. 2. you sometimes leave the premises before your job is done. 3. you act on your own accord and you sometimes take more interest in others' workplaces rather than your own. 4. you do not wear equipment when you work and you object to the notion when you are reminded of it. 5. you cannot start working on your own, you always require incentive and motivation. 6. you leave a dirty mess behind you when your work is done. 7. you get tired very easily and you sleep for hours, sometimes days. 8. you get picky about the job to be done and decline doing job offers, you act maladjusted to company's wishes. 9. you are rendered unable to work before 60 years old.  and also as a side note, the fact that you are always seen with two balls makes you look like a weirdo."""	1

'yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in heaven.'

"there was a tramp walking  there was a tramp walking out in the country during a long winters night when he heard a girl screaming.  he turned to see a little girl struggling in the broken ice in the middle of the lake. she'd been skating and had fallen into the icy water. without a moment's hesitation the tramp ran onto the ice and slipped and slided over to the little girl. he managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and he carried her back to the road.  he took off his coat and wrapped the little girl in it and began looking for a car to flag down. a few moments later a huge chauffeur-driven limo pulled up, and who stepped out but the little girl's father - the mayor of the nearby town and a multi-millionaire.  ""how can i ever thank you sir?"" says the father after putting his daughterinto the warmth of the limo.  ""just name your price - i'm a wealthy man.""  ""ahem, well ..."" stammered the tramp ""...eh i'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out""  ""certainly"" says the girl's father and he pulls out his wallet.  ""oh dear"" says the father, ""i don't carry much cash with me, i only have ten dollars - but come home with me and i'll get more from the safe""  ""no! no!"" says the tramp, ""why ten dollars is more money than i've seen in my whole life - that will be plenty"".     ""well, if you insist"" says the father - ""now what will you do with your money?""  ""oh that's easy"" says the tramp ""i've not had a rest in 20 years. i think i'll buy myself a holiday""  ""well good luck"" says the father, and he gets into the car and signals his chauffeur to drive home.  ""ten dollars"" thinks the tramp, ""i'm rich! i'm rich!"", and off he goes to the town, to buy himself a holiday.  he finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk.  ""i'll have one holiday please!""  ""ahem, which holiday would sir like"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.  ""oh, any holiday i don't mind"" replied the tramp.  ""well how much money does sir have to spend on sir's holiday?""  ""oh lots - anything up to ten dollars""  ""ten dollars!! you'll never get a holiday for ten dollars"" says the girl incredulously.  ""oh dear"" said the tramp, ""and i was so looking forward to a holiday - i'll probably never get another chance - isn't there anything you can do?""  ""well i don't think so sir, but hold on and i'll check""  the girl goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. there - to her amazement - she finds an old file.  ""well you'll never believe it"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop.  ""i've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten dollars""  ""yippee"", exclaims the tramp, ""i'll take it""     the tramp takes the tickets and, shouldering his dirty old pack, he heads out the door to hitch-hike to the port where the ship is waiting.  a few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen. amazed at his luck and good fortune, he slings his pack over his shoulder, and marches up the gangplank.  ""get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.  ""but i've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and i want on!""  hardly believeing his eyes, the captain examines the ticket and admits that our man the tramp is correct.  ""ahem, well o.k."", says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, i don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. come back at midnight when it's dark and i'll let you on then.""  so the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.  ""psst"", says a voice, waking him with a start. it was the captain.  ""hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin""  the tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship! the tramp had never in his wildest dreams imagined luxury like this.  first they went doen through the first class level:  oriental carpets - 6"" pile.  a genuine rembrahndt on every wall.  leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair.  24 ct gold trim everywhere.     then the second class:  as above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep.  and so on...  3rd, 4th, 5th class,  down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with, a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.  ""sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""a room of my very own.""  ""i'm glad you like it"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing...""  ""your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. so that's what the alarm clock is for. enjoy your cruise.""  well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. one-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...  then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. he had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below. he climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived....  ...and what a dive...!  perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple. now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.  ""that was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""where did you learn to dive like that?""  ""eh, well i've never actually dived before"" replied the tramp.  ""well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""i've never seen ....""  he broke off.     ""hey, i've an idea"", he started again.  ""how would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. i'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""  ""it's a deal!"" says our man.  for the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced. back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it. then one morning the captain came to talk.  ""o.k. i'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. we're going to erect a high diving board for you.""  ""o.k."" agreed the tramp.  two days passed, and the big day arrived. the ship was humming with excitement. everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. the captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck.  gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. then the tramp turned to regard the diving board. higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.  ""well tramp"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""let's see what you can do.""  and with that the captain handed him a walkie talkie.  and the tramp began to climb....  up and up ...  up and up ...  higher and higher ...  below him the ship grew smaller ...  up and up ...  on and on ...  past a solitary albatross ...  and still higher, till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below ...  still further, till the ocean grew dim, and the earth itself began to shrink...  and higher, ever higher ...  on and on ....  higher, and higher, and on and on towards the diving board,  he climbed on top and radioed the captain .... and then...  he jumped .     slowly at first  but speeding up  faster, and faster  and by now the earth was growing large in the distance,  the oceans and land masses grew clear,  faster, and faster...  past the albatross,  faster  double-back somersault,  and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,  hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,  down on the ship the crew strained their necks,  ""i can see him!"" yelled a passenger, ""look!!""  the tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...  not a ripple on the surface!  down through the water!  smashed through the pool bottom!  down through the first deck!  smashing through the second!  down!  down!  through the crew's quarters!  through the engine rooms!  smashing through his own little cabin!  and down through the steel hull of the ship!  still down...!  deeper,  deeper into the murky depths,  till..........  smash! into into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.  desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.  up and up, desperate, gasping....  out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.  hero! wonderful! amazing! bloody good show what!  and handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.  ""well tramp, i have never seen anything like that, ever. that was the most stupendous piece of diving i have ever seen""  the tramp blushed.  the captain went on:  ""but tell me; most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""  and the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly:  ""well you see i'm a poor tramp so you must understand...  >!i've been through many a hardship in my life""!<"	1

""these are your cars now!"" and hands the man all the car keys. again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says ""everyone down here gets some cool cars! how would you drive around without having cars?"".  they walk on and the area gets even nicer. there are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. they arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. she looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. the man couldnÂ´t be any happier. the devil says ""everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we donÂ´t want anyone to be lonely!""  as they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. he peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. there are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. a stench of sulfur is in the air.  terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""what is going on there?"" the devil just shrugs and says: ""those are the christians, i donÂ´t know why, but they prefer it that way""."	1

"samsung note 7 there was once a man named sam, who lived in a town named samsville - ironic, i know.  well, sam was a really good singer, so good that he became famous and began touring the world.  on sam's tour, he was singing, like any ordinary song, and then, suddenly, he sung a note so perfect it could melt hearts.  a member of the audience who happened to be a father of a church cried out that he knew what that was; a holy note.  he explained that a holy note was extremely rare, and could only be sung by the most talented of singers.  now that it was known that sam was able to sing holy notes, his tours became infinitely times more popular.  as he toured the world, sam sung holy notes 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 and then his tour was over.  after the tour, sam decided to go back o his home town of samsville for one last show to the people he knew and loved.  he performed the show in their local church which was oddly large, and the mayor of the town attended.  about halfway during the performance, sam sung a note so horrible that it sounded like a cross between a loud metal fork being scraped across a dinner plate and a demon screeching.  after he sung this note, sam burst into flames and melted to the ground in a puddle of human goo.  everyone was so shocked, the whole church was silent.  after a moment, the mayor questioned what just happened.  the father of the church looked at the mayor with a sad look and said, ""don't you know mayor... sam sung note 7...""  &#x200b;  end of joke, if you didn't get it, here's an explanation.  the phone samsung note 7 was notorious for bursting into flames so at the end of the joke where the father says that sam sung note 7, its a joke about the phone.  i know it's less funny when i have to explain it, but to some of the people that i have told this joke to in real life, i had to explain it.  :d"	1

""so i'm a huge fan of gardening. i love cutting my plants and making sure they look beautiful. today i was in my balcony gardening my plants when a bird flew into my face. i tried to move backwards as i was shocked, but i tripped over a plant and fell over the railing on my balcony. luckily for me, i managed to grab the edge of my neighbor's balcony 2 floors below mine. i called for help, and he came outside with a crazed look in his eye. he saw me and ran back inside. i thought he was getting help, but the lunatic came back with a hammer and smashed my fingers. i inevitably lost my grip and fell, but luckily i landed in some bushes. i thought that i was saved, and was ready to celebrate when a refridgerator fell from the sky and killed me.""  at this point st. peter was extremely amused. he let the second man in, and was eager to hear the third man's story. he told the third man the conditions, and the third man began to tell his tale.

"voodoo dick. there was a man that often went away on business trips. while he was away on his trips, his wife would get very... frustrated. so, before a long trip, the husband wanted to get his wife something special to help the 'lonliness' while he was away.   he went to his local sex shop, and talked to the person behind the counter. he explained his situation, and then asked: ""i need something really amazing for my wife. all i see here are normal toys. do you have anything in the back that will really knock her socks off?""  ""well sir, there's the voodoo dick, but i don't want to sell you that. it's too powerful"" replied the clerk.  ""please! that sounds exactly like what my wife needs!"" said the man.  the salesclerk took him into a room and pulled out a box. they opened it, and inside was something that looked like a normal dildo.  ""that doesn't look like anything special... what does it do?"" he asked.  the clerk gave the man a wink. ""check this out. voodoo dick, the door."" the toy jumped out of the box and began to thrust itself against the door.  ""voodoo dick, the ceiling!"" the clerk shouted. like magic, the dildo shot towards the ceiling and began pumping away.  ""i'll take it!"" the man was so happy. the clerk put the toy back in the box and wrapped it up.   so the man took the voodoo dick back home to his wife and showed her how to use it. then, he left for his next trip.  the wife, with her husband away, took out the voodoo dick and said ""voodoo dick... my pussy!""   it was the best toy she had ever had. she kept at it for hours.   finally, she wanted it to stop. unfortunately, every time she pulled it out, it just lept back in and started again. she decided to go to the sex shop to see if the clerk could tell her how to turn if off.  while she was driving, the voodoo dick started making her come. her arms and legs were shaky, so she started swerving, and a cop pulled her over.  when the cop came to her window, she was frantic. ""somyhusbandgotmethevoodoodickandican'tgetitoutsoiwantedtogobacktotheshopbutistartedtohaveanorgasmandiwasshakingandthatswhyiwasswervingandican'tgetittostopit'sstillgoingnow..."" she blurted as the toy was still going to town.

john and the cab driver one cold, winter evening john finished his office job in london victoria and went straight to the pub. he had few drinks too many that night and decided to take a cab home, but when he looked in his wallet he only had last Â£20 inside. he approached a black cab outside the pub and asked how much would it cost him to go to kings cross and the cabbie replied Â£25. after asking if he could possibly take him for Â£20 the cab driver declined and told him to get a buss. john was desperate for that cab so he asked again and again but without any luck, the cab driver just wouldnât change his mind. so having no choice john had to take a bus home. the next morning he woke up with a sore head and it was time to go back to work. when he left his apartment and was walking past kings cross station he passed a long line of black taxis and on the end of that line was the cabbie from last night. john went back to the first taxi and asked the driver how much was it to victoria, he replied Â£25. john said â iâll give you Â£50 if you suck me off on our wayâ the cabbies response was âfuck off you pervertâ. then john approached the second cab in line and popped the same question and pretty much got the same response. he carried on from cab to cab asking the same question and getting the same answer until he finally got to the last cab, the one from previous night in victoria. he asked the driver âhow much is it to victoria?â he responded âitâs Â£25 mateâ, then john said â i tell you what, iâll give you Â£50 if you drive off slowly and we both wave to all of your cabdriver friendsâ	1

""do you think that will work?"" she asked.   ""just worked for me!!"" he replied."	1

""these men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over afghanistan."" he says, ""instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive allah's justice, then return home.""  the marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.  after 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.

"one evening, after attending the theater, two gentlemen were walking down the avenue when they observed a rather well-dressed and attractive young lady walking ahead of them.  one of them turned to the other and remarked, ""i'd give $250.00 to spend the night with that woman."" much to their surprise, the young lady overheard the remark, turned around, and replied, ""i'll take you up on that offer.""     she had a neat appearance and a pleasant voice, so after bidding his companion good night, the man accompanied the young lady to her apartment. the following morning the man presented her with $125.00 as he prepared to leave. she demanded the rest of the money, stating, ""if you don't give me the other $125.00, i'll sue you for it."" he laughed, saying ""i'd like to see you get it on these grounds.""     within a few days, he was surprised when he received a summons ordering his presence in court as a defendant in a lawsuit. he hurried to his lawyer and explained the details of the case. his lawyer said, ""she can't possibly get a judgment against you on such grounds, but it will be interesting to see how her case will be presented.""     after the usual preliminaries, the lady's lawyer addressed the court as follows: ""your honor, my client, this lady, is the owner of a piece of property, a garden spot, surrounded by a profuse growth of shrubbery, which property she agreed to rent to the defendant for a specified length of time for the sum of $250.00. the defendant took possession of the property, used it extensively for the purposes for which it was rented, but upon evacuating the premises, he paid only $125.00, one-half of the amount agreed upon. the rent was not excessive, since it is restricted property, and we ask judgment be granted against the defendant to assure payment of the balance.""     the defendant's lawyer was impressed and amused by the way his opponent had presented the case. his defense, therefore, was somewhat different from the way he originally planned to present it. ""your honor,"" he said, ""my client agrees that the lady has a fine piece of property, that he did rent such property for a time, and a degree of pleasure was derived from the transaction. however, my client found a well on the property around which he placed his own stones, sunk a shaft, and erected a pump, all labor performed personally by him. we claim these improvements to the property were sufficient to offset the unpaid amount, and that the plaintiff was adequately compensated for the rental of said property. we, therefore, ask that judgment not be granted.""     the young lady's lawyer answered thus: ""your honor, my client agrees that the defendant did find a well on her property. however, had the defendant not known that the well existed, he would never have rented the property. also, upon evacuating the premises, the defendant removed the stones, pulled out the shaft, and took the pump with him. in doing so, he not only dragged the equipment through the shrubbery but left the hole much larger than it was prior to his occupancy, making the property much less desirable to others. we, therefore, ask that judgment be granted.""     in the judge's decision, he provided two options: ""pay the $125.00 or have the equipment detached and provided to the plaintiff for damages."" the defendant wrote a check immediately."	1

""i happen to own the toughest bulldog in the whole shire, and he's never been beaten in a fight. i'll wager Â£1000 that my dog could beat that ugly mutt of yours any day of the week.""  the aussie takes the barman up on the bet and they bundle the two unfortunate creatures unceremoniously into the back room of the pub and pull the door shut. immediately there is a frenzy of snarls, growls and yelps, followed by an eerie silence.   grinning, the barman opens the door, keen to collect on his Â£1000 wager. to his dismay, his bulldog is lying dead in a pool of blood whilst the aussie's four-legged companion lays in the middle of the room, casually chewing on the remains of the bulldog's left rear leg.  the barman shakes his head as he reaches into his back pocket and hands over a large roll of bank notes.  ""17 fights..."", he mutters, ""17 fights my dog has been in and he's never lost a single one until now. who ever knew that such an odd-looking mutt as yours would be able to fight so well. what sort of breed did you say he was again?""  ""he's a long-nosed, short-eared, long-bodied, short-legged water-hound,"" the aussie grinned, ""although up in far north queensland where i come from we just call them crocodiles."""	1

"a well-dressed man, complete with top hat and monocle, walks into a bar. the bartender, who has seen it all, pours the dapper gentleman two fingers of their top-shelf 25-year-old scotch. just as the man begins nursing the peaty, smoky booze, a rabbi, a priest, and a minister all walk into the bar, arguing about how to prove the existence of their respective gods.  moments later, as the bartender is busy filling their orders, three women; a blonde, brunette, and a redhead, walk into the bar. apparently, each just had a bizarre encounter with a traffic cop, and needed a drink as they swapped stories and advice.   soon, a mathematician, a physicist, and the dean of the local college swept through the door. they were engaged in some heated debate about something so profound and obscure, it was difficult for the bartender to even parse out the topic that has his customers so riled up! still, the bartender is a professional, and after a few minutes of trying to get their attention, he finally gets their orders and begins filling them. in the meantime, the dapper gentleman signaled for another splash of the good stuff, and the bartender is pleased to note a $100 bill peaking out from under the empty glass. he rushes to fill this, as well as a half-dozen other orders.  he barely got the peanut bowls refilled when the door opens once again, this time admitting an old cowboy (whose horse, much to the bartender's surprise, is tied to a hitching post he never noticed before), and what appeared to be a wwii-era sailor. both needed a drought of his strongest stuff, pronto. the bartender risks stepping away from the bar to slip into the storage room. there, he digs out an ancient, dusty bottle of that ol' widowmaker. according to legend, wyatt earp once took a swig from this very bottle before riding out on his vendetta against the cowboys. the bartender knew this was bullshit, but hey, the customers liked the story well enough, and they always seemed willing to pay the exorbitant price for a single shot. the cowboy and the sailor silently downed their shots, and while never breaking eye-contact, silently dared the other to grimace. as this contest of masculinity raged on, the door opened once more.  a man of absolutely no outlandish characteristics walks in. he takes the final empty stool at the bar. the bartender actually breathes a sigh of relief, but then gasps the breath right back in when the man pulls a ten-inch pianist and correspondingly small but fully-functional piano out of his satchel. the tiny piano player immediate sits down and begins banging out some 1930's-era ragtime piece. the bartender decides he should make his rounds before confronting this new strangeness.  just as the bartender made his way back to the bar after making a wide circuit among his eclectic customers, a young man approached him with a bet: that he, the young man, could pee into a shot glass placed at one end of the bar while he stood on the other end, without spilling a single drop. that was when the bartender noticed a small group of similar young men at the pool tables. they were watching the developing scene with keen interest.  that was it. flabbergasted, the bartender stood up on top of the bar, and at the top of his voice, yelled, *""what is this, some kind of joke?!?""*"	1

"100% true story - funniest thing that ever happened to me not long after my younger son was born i left the army and, not having a new job to go to and my wife having a great job, i looked after the house and my two boys for some years.  when my older son started school, we would walk home together and discuss what he'd learned and talk about life.  he was (and still is, many years later) an earnest chap with a real curiosity for the world around him.  and i became used to having to answer quite obscure questions about science and society.  so i wasn't too surprised when, one day as we walked home, after a few moments when he looked really deep in thought, he asked me:  ""daddy, what's a soul?""  now, i wasn't born yesterday.  i know a parent-trap when i see one, so i said:  ""well, it depends on how you spell it.  if you spell it one way, it can mean the bottom of your foot, or a type of fish.  but if you spell it another way, it's what people call the bit of you that some people think lives for ever.""  he took all of this in and looked like there was some important issue still nagging at him.  i could tell there was more to come and i waited patiently, as we walked along, with all the wisdom of the grown-up that i could muster.  and sure enough, eventually, he opened his mouth to ask the question that was really eating at him:  ""so, daddy,' he said, ""what's an ar-soul?"" . . . . . . . this was almost thirteen years ago and i'm still laughing."	1

just in time for the farmers thanksgiving. nsfw there was this farmer that every morning would wake up and the first thing he would do is fart. wet farts, dry farts, stinky farts, and especially loud farts. his wife would constantly tell him, âhoney, you really need to go to the doctor and have them look at that, one day youâll end up farting your guts out.â and every time he just rudely brushes her off and never goes to the doctor.   well, along comes thanksgiving day and the wife gets up really early in the morning to start preparing the big meal. she gets the turkey to start preparing it, she reaches inside to pull the innards out and a lightbulb goes off in her head. knowing that her husband is a heavy sleeper, she sneaks back into the bedroom with the turkey guts and slips them into his underwear. giggling to herself she heads back to the kitchen and gets back to working on the dinner.   a while later, sure enough she hears him let one rip she could hear it all the way in the kitchen. itâs immediately followed by a blood curdling scream. she laughed to herself and just goes back to work. a short while later, her husband walks into the kitchen fairly proud of himself and says; âhoney, you were right, i should have gone to a doctor about that fart. cause this morning i did fart my guts out.â excitedly he holds up 2 fingers and exclaimed âbut by god, with these 2 fingers, i got em back in!â	1

"a man and a woman were dating. she, being of a religious nature, had held back the worldly pleasure that he wanted from her so badly. in fact, he had never even seen her naked.   one day, as they slowly drove down the freeway, she remarked about his slow driving habits. ""i can't stand it anymore,"" she told him. ""let's play a game. for every 5 miles per hour over the speed limit [60 mph] you drive, i'll remove one piece of clothing.""  he enthusiastically agreed and sped up the car. he reached the 65 mph mark, so she took off her blouse. at 70 off came the pants. at 75 it was her bra and at 80 her panties. now seeing her naked for the first time...and traveling faster than he ever had before...he became very excited and lost control of the car.  he veered off the road, went over an embankment, and hit a tree! his girlfriend was not hurt, but he was trapped. she tried to pull him free but alas he was stuck.  ""go to the road and get help,"" he said. ""i don't have anything to cover myself with!"" she replied.  the man felt around, but could only reach one of his shoes. ""you'll have to put this between your legs to cover it up,"" he told her. so she did as he said and went up to the road for help.  along came a truck driver. seeing a naked, crying woman along the road, he pulled over to hear her story. ""my boyfriend! my boyfriend!"" she sobs, ""he's stuck and i can't pull him out!""  the truck driver looking down at the shoe between her legs replied, ""ma'am if he's in that far, i'm afraid he's a goner!"""	1

""sounds like a catch to me! where can i find him?""  ""he's just a block over, but he's also a little kooky. see, he only has sex with women named after flowers, so if i meet someone like that, i send them his way. then, he sends me the flower as a thank you. yesterday was rose, and a week ago, i recommended a woman named violet to him,"" he said, indicating a slightly wilted violet in a vase behind him.   the woman thanks him for the info and leaves the shop, a little bitter about her own name. but she visits the well-endowed florist anyway. she steps up to the counter and pointedly says, ""i heard you're particularly...*skilled*...in certain areas?""  he smirks. ""what is your name?""   she pouts a little and says ""kris."" his smile falters, and he sighs and shakes his head.  kris's heart drops. ""well...then i'd like some flowers for my mother.""  suddenly, he brightens up again. ""i think we can make this work."" he takes her hand and locks the shop door.   three hours of mind-altering sex later, she stumbles to the shop door and bids him goodbye with a kiss. ""and please,"" he says, ""tell your mother she is welcome to as many flowers from my shop as she would like."" taken aback, she promises to convey the message, and calls her mother that night to tell her everything.   the next day, kris feels like a million bucks and swings by the original florist's shop.  ""i just wanted to thank you for telling me about that gentleman! he was amazing!""  he smiles sheepishly. ""i suppose i should thank you too. i just got another beautiful flower for recommending you to him.""

shameless self-repost an elf courier walked through a dense, mystical forest  carrying a sealed message from his king with only a map to show where to deliver it to  &nbsp;   as he arrived at his destination, he could see movement in the huge, thousand-year old enchanted oak trees and decided to take a closer look  &nbsp;   upon inspection, he discovered that they were treants! he realised that he had been sent to deliver a message to the kingdom of sentient trees,  &nbsp;   he stopped to ask them directions towards where he should hand in the letter, as he moved closer he realised they were working on a particularly strange looking tree with millions of tiny branches winding like coils.  &nbsp;   âahem,â he began, âiâm sorry to bother you but i have been sent to deliver a message to your king, where can i find him?â  &nbsp;   the two treants slowly turned around and looked upon him with suspicious eyes, however they soon relaxed as they realised the elf was alone and not armed.  &nbsp;   âwe have no king, only the great elder, you can carry onwards west until you find the tall ebony arches which signifies the royal halls.â one treant said, speaking softly and well-mannered, before him and his friend turned back to work on the mysterious tree.  &nbsp;   curious, the elf wished to learn more about what the treants were doing;  âwhat is it that youâre working on?â he asked,  &nbsp;   yet again, the treants slowly turned around before stating; âthis is the communication tree, it has magic infused within which can allow us to speak with our kind through itâs many branches, it is our job to send messages and keep it well-maintained.â  &nbsp;   satisfied, the elf thanked them for the information and carried on towards the royal halls.  &nbsp;   upon arrival, he was ushered into the great elderâs chambers, where he was met with darkness and a great silence.  &nbsp;   suddenly, a loud, booming voice echoed through the room; âwho enters the great chamber?â  &nbsp;   the elf was rather spooked by the noise and slinked back before whimpering out the words âi am just a messenger from the elven kingdom,â  &nbsp;   out of the corner of the room, a giant tree with grey bark and ritualistic carvings slowly stepped into the dim light.  &nbsp;   âi welcome you,â the treat said, a little more softly this time, âi apologise for any discomfort i may have caused you, for sometimes even i do not know the strength of my own voice.â  &nbsp;   the elf delivered the letter to the elder and turned to leave, but was stopped by the great elder;  &nbsp;   âwait, before you go, i wish to apologise for scaring you, it was not my intention. please, allow me,â  &nbsp;   the treant gave the confused elf food and water before speaking again;  &nbsp;   âi wish to talk to you, i am over a thousand years old and i do not get much company aside from other treants who come here only to worship me. please, i am somewhat lonely, will you stay and chat with me?â  &nbsp;   the elf didnât want to refuse an offer from the great elder - that would be insulting to the whole treant kingdom! so, he accepted, and the two sat for hours chatting about their lives, the elven and treant homes, the differences between their races and how the letter the elf had just delivered was a peace offering between the two kingdoms.   &nbsp;   however, it was clear that the elder had very poor social skills, as he sounded and looked uncomfortable and sometimes had nothing to say.  &nbsp;   to lighten the mood, the elf decided to tell a joke.  &nbsp;   he said, âwhy did the boar cross the footpath?â  &nbsp;   after a few seconds of intense contemplation, the elder replied âin order for the boar to cross the footpath, it would have had to have been close to the road, however they are skittish creatures and often do not wander into intelligent civilisation, so the probability of this occurrence would be so incredibly low that i have not considered it ever happening, and unfortunately i do not have an answer to this question.â  &nbsp;   the elf, dumbfounded, decided to carry on with the joke and say, âto get to the other side!â  &nbsp;   the great elder thought for an even longer duration, before finally replying,  âyes, i suppose that is a plausible reason for movement.â  &nbsp;   the elf then realised that the treant had never heard a joke in itâs life! he decided to then teach the elder how to tell jokes. he explained, in detail, the intricacies of humour to the elder, who quietly listened with intent.   &nbsp;   finally, the elf said, âi have taught you all i know, now i wish to see if i have been successful in my mentoring, please tell me a joke,â  &nbsp;   the elder steeled himself and thought precariously for 4 long minutes, the elf getting impatient, before finally beginning to speak.  &nbsp;   âwhy did the griffin fly south instead of east in the springtime?â  &nbsp;   the elf replied âi donât know, why *did* the griffin fly south instead of east in the springtime?â  &nbsp;   the great treant then replied, in the most monotonous voice; âbecause he thought that it was summertime instead of springtime!â  &nbsp;   the great elder burst out laughing with the deepest and heartiest laugh imaginable.  &nbsp;   âdo you understand? because griffins normally fly east in the springtime and south in the summertime, but this particular griffin had mistaken springtime for summertime and flown south instead of east!â  &nbsp;   the elf, not wanting to cause any insult, decided to laugh along with the great one, however he did not feel like the elder truly understood the concept of a joke.  &nbsp;   upon leaving the kingdom to return to his home, the elf found the first two treants he had seen on his journey, and wanted to thank them before making his return.  &nbsp;   as he approached, he saw that they were still working on the magical tree used for the treantâs communications. this time it was twitching and lighting up, it seems the tree was working and the treants were sending messages.  &nbsp;   âhello, i thank you again for your directions, i have successfully delivered my letter and will be heading off shortly.â  &nbsp;   the treants slowly turned around before waving him off before one treant said âwatch out for the two-dimensional spiderlings, i heard that they are a real *plane* in the backside!â   &nbsp;   the elf laughed out loud, uncontrollably from the unexpected joke.  &nbsp;   âyou like that?â the other treant said, âi have one of my own, why did the necromancerâs skeletons flee the battle?â  &nbsp;   the elf smiled and waited for the punchline;   &nbsp;   âbecause they had no guts!â  &nbsp;   again the elf burst out laughing, even harder than the last time.  &nbsp;   âwow, you guys are great at telling jokes, much better than the great elder.â said the elf,  &nbsp;   the treants replied; âwhy of course, everybody knows the best jokes are always in the comm-ents!â	1

a man with no arms applies to be the local church bell squire. the pastor looks him over and says - well, we didn't get alot of interest in the posting, so the job is yours, but i'm not sure how you plan on pulling the rope to the bell? the man climbs up to the church steeple and runs at the bell as fast as he can. boooong! he hits it with his face and it sounds perfectly clear!  the pastor isn't excited about the idea, but hires him anyway as he really needs the help. for weeks the squire sounds the bell clearly and on time for service in the morning. one day however, he gets too careless, and runs at the bell and misses! falls ten stories from the steeple to his death. the congregation gathers around him, and begin asking questions - who is this man? - where did he come from? someone pipes up - i dunno, but his face sure rings a bell...?  a month later the pastor is having trouble replacing his previous bell tower squire when another man with no arms enters his church looking to apply for the job. the pastor is amazed! the man turns out to be his previous squires twin brother! he gladly hires him for the job after a quick show that he also sounds the bell perfectly in a similar unorthodox fashion. a few weeks go by and the brother becomes careless also. he misses the bell and tumbles ten stories from the steeple to his death! again the congregation gathers in curiosity around the poor man's body. someone observes the obvious family resemblance - hey! he's a dead ringer to the guy last month!	1

the farmer a farmer was worried that none of his pigs were getting pregnant. he called a vet and asked what he should do if he wanted more pigs. the vet told him he should try artificial insemination. the farmer, not wanting to appear stupid, answered okay and hung up the phone. unclear on what the vet meant by artificial insemination, the farmer decided it must mean he had to impregnate the pigs himself, so he loaded all the pigs in his pickup and drove down to the woods and shagged them all.  the next day he called the vet again, and asked how would he know if the pigs were pregnant. the vet told him they would be lying down rolling in the mud, but when he looked out the window not even one was lying down.  so, he loaded them up in his pickup again and drove them to the woods and shagged them all again. to his dismay they were all standing the next morning. so, again he loads the pigs in his truck drives them to the woods and shags them for the third time.  by the next morning the farmer is beat, so he asks his wife to hop out of bed and look out the window to see what the pigs are doing.  she says 'hmmm - that's weird, they are all in the truck and one of them is blowing the horn.'	1

""what does it mean?"" asked the astronauts. ""oh i cannot tell you. it is a secret that only our tribe and moon spirits are allowed to know."" when they returned to their base, the astronauts searched and searched until they found someone who could speak the tribal language, and asked him to translate the message. when they repeated what they had memorised, the translator started to laugh uproariously. when he calmed down, the astronauts asked him what it meant. the man explained that the sentence they had memorised so carefully meant, ""don't believe a single word these people are telling you. they have come to steal your lands.""    ----stolen shamelessly from yuval noah harari's sapiens"	1

""i don't have a clue!!!"" the rabbi said.  ""first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger. then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here.""  ""and then what?"" asked a woman.  ""who knows!!"" said the rabbi. ""he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!"""	1

"a lemon, a potato, and a pea all had a tough week working at the grocery store... ...so they decided to let off some steam with a bar crawl at the weekend.  they had a great time, hitting bar after bar, knocking back drinks, but being so genetically different, the alcohol affected them each in different ways: the lemon got very acidic and refluxy; the potato, being a big starchy chap, took the booze in his stride; while the little pea reacted to all the sugar and started to get a touch hyperactive.  at the end of the night, the three friends found themselves leaving a bar at the top of a tall hill, when all of a sudden the pea started bouncing up and down excitedly: ""lads! lads! i've got a great idea! weâre all vaguely round in shape, let's not get a cab home, let's just roll down the hill!"" and before the others could protest he was off - shooting down the hill at a rate of knots.  the lemon lurched after him, but soon started listing violently from side to side as he went, owing to his oval shape, which did nothing for his unsettled stomach. with a sigh, the potato trundled along slowly behind.  by the time the potato had bounced his way to the bottom of the hill, the lemon was spewing lemon juice all over the pavement, but the pea was already jumping up and down again ""that was great, that was great, let's do it again!"".   the lemon was now chundering up pips with the acid, but the pea didn't seem to care ""come on! let's go again, that was great!"".  the potato turned to him and said ""easy peasy, lemon's queasy.""     edit: typo. also, i donât know if itâs the done thing to âthank you for the goldâ etc, but british politeness prevails: thanks for my first gold &amp; silver!"	1

"a man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. he goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, ""my car broke down. do you think i could stay the night?""the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. as the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. a sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. the sirens that nearly seduced odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. he doesn't sleep that night. he tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.the next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, ""we can't tell you. you're not a monk."" distraught, the man is forced to leave.years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.the monks reply, ""we can't tell you. you're not a monk.""the man sa,ys, ""if the only way i can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.""the monks reply, ""you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. when you find these answers, you will have become a monk.""the man sets about his task. after years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. a monk answers. he is taken before a gathering of all the monks.""in my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, i traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: by design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. only god knows what you ask. all a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.""the monks reply, ""congratulations. you have become a monk. we shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.""the monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, ""the sound is beyond that door.""the monks give him the key, and he opens the door. behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. the man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. and so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. the sound has become very clear and definite. the monks say, ""this is the last key to the last door.""the man is apprehensive to no end. his life's wish is behind that door!with trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......but, of course, i can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."	1

"at the national art gallery in dublin... ... a husband and wife were staring at a portrait that had them completely confused. the painting depicted three black men totally naked, sitting on a bench. two of the figures had black penises, but the one in the middle had a pink penis. the curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered his personal assessment. he went on for over half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of african americans in a predominately white patriarchal society . ""in fact"", he pointed out, ""some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary society"".   after the curator left, an irishman approached the couple and said, ""would you like to know what the painting is really about?""   ""now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery""? asked the couple.   ""because i am the artist, who painted the picture"", he replied, ""in fact, there are no african americans depicted at all. they're just three irish coal miners. the guy in the middle went home for lunch"""	1

"after years of research and exploration, an archaeologist discovered an ancient book... the book was said to answer any question asked of it. being a professional, the archaeologist took the book back to his prestigious university, which was home to several leaders of certain fields. to research the book's power in a controlled manner, the archaeologist rounds up three of the university's brightest minds. a researcher of astrophysics, who had led the field for many years and had produced many papers theorising cosmic events was first. the archaeologist told him to ask the book one question, and to document whether the response was accurate.  the astrophysicist thought for a moment and asked the book ""what was existence like before the big bang?""  the archaeologist opened the book and showed the physicist, and he instantly went insane and began scrawling equations on the nearest pad of paper, mumbling distressed words to himself.  shocked and uneasy, but willing to see his research through, the archaeologist moved on to the next researcher, a leading professor of mathematics. she had produced many papers and interpretations on numbers themselves, and the human interpretations behind ever-growing sequences. the archaeologist asked the mathematician to ask the book a question.  the mathematician barely thought for a second. ""how can a human being best visualise infinity?""  the archaeologist once again opened the book and showed it to the mathematician. her eyes widened in shock and confusion and she, too, went insane immediately. she ran out of the room yelling, back to her notes to make sense of what she'd seen.  shaken but persistent, the archaeologist turned to the final volunteer. he was one of the world's most highly regarded philosophers, and had spent his whole life researching different views and interpretations of a variety of philosophical debates. the philosopher knew the process by now, and confidently asked:  ""what is the meaning of life?""  the archaeologist opened the book and showed the philosopher. confused at first, the philosopher let out a sigh.  ""my dear boy, i'm afraid to say that your book doesn't work. the pages are blank."""	1

"two long time friends, ollie and brock, woke up early for work as they always do. they each got into their trucks and headed to the local ag plant where they work as produce haulers.  ""what do you have for us today flower?"" asked brock as they walk in.  their secretaryâs real name is ava but they always jokingly call her flower.  ""well we've got three shipments that all need taken up north to pepperâs corner market,"" says flower, ""asparagus, brussels sprouts, and artichokes.""  ""i'll take the artichokes!"" tom says as he walks in the room, late as usual, happily walking past the other two. the artichokes would be the heaviest so he would get paid slightly more for the same trip.Â   brock and ollie often argued over the produce and then tom would hear his cue, come bursting through the door, and take the best choice.  brock and ollie sigh in unison, they were hoping he wouldnât turn up. Â   ""fine i'll take the sprouts,"" ollie concedes and they all head off.Â   \\---  ""man, that tom gordon is the worst human being,"" brock says over the radio to ollie.Â   ""i know,"" ollie agrees, âhe always takes the good shipment. wish heâd let us have it for once.â  âiâm thinking of getting a new truck here pretty soon,â brock said, âprobably get a heavier one so i can haul more.  this oneâs in good shape, figure i can sell her easy enough.â  âdefinitely wonât be able to keep up with me then,â ollie challenges his friend, ânot that you can now.â  âhey i donât care, it runs fine just doesnât have much room,â brock answers, âplus i bet i can beat you as it is.â  they drive for about an hour before ollie gets a call from ava.   âwell brock,â ollie radios to his friend, âi guess i wonât beat you this time.  i just got a call from mrs. kahto and she wants me to go give tom a tow.  guess heâs stuck on the side of the road somewhere.â  âleave him there,â brock says impatiently.   âi wish i could. why am i the one that has to get him?â  \\---  ollie pulls up behind tom and gets out to find him standing near his back right tire.    âgot a flat huh?â ollie asks him seeing the tire squashed against the ground.  âyeah,â says tom, âthanks for coming to get me. damn thing always leaks.â    âwell you know, thatâs what you get for always taking the heavy shipments,â ollie says nicely enough.  tom looks at his flat tire regretfully.    âi know,â he mutters, âi should have brought asparagus.â"	1

"there was a man. an especially unattractive man. he had sex when he was younger. but the older and uglier he grew the less women wanted to be with him. at present he hadn't had sex in over 30 years. no prostitute would sleep with him. not even a blowjob or a handjob. such was his level of ugliness. he had given up on jerking off years ago. he needed to have sex. he was desperate.  so one day he goes to a doctor. he doesn't know why. sheer desperation drives him. maybe some miracle drug that will relieve his sexual tension. maybe the doc knows of some woman equally as desperate. he doesn't know. but he goes anyway.   he explains to the doc the situation and how he misses sex so much. predictably the doctor says there's no drug to simulate sex. there's no one as ugly as him that would want to sleep with him. there just nothing the doc can do. so the man gets up. sad. dejected. horny. he's about to leave when the doc says wait a minute. "" son,you're not the first man i've had this issue with. the worst case yes,but not the first. so i might have an idea. you won't like it. but it works"". the man is desperate. ""anything doc. please. tell me. help me."". the doc says "" ok.  down at the harbour  on friday nights there's an old fishing vessel that docks there called the santa marie. on the port side of the ship there is a barrel. this barrel has a hole in it. i'm sure you can figure out what to do with that hole son."" the man is a little disappointed but you know what, he has nothing to lose. fucking a barrel with a hole is better than nothing.  so that friday he goes to the harbour and finds the santa marie. he finds the barrel and lo and behold there is actually a line of ugly men waiting to fuck the hole on this barrel. this makes the man feel a little more comfortable. he's not alone in this world. he smiles to himself. soon enough it's his turn to have a go. he's a little nervous but with some encouragement and much horniness he has a go. and my god does it feel good. the man was amazed at how tight and smooth this hole in a barrel was. he starts thrusting harder and he is loving it. soon enough he cums inside the barrel and satisfied for the night,he nods his new friends goodnight and leaves.   he does this routine every week. he loves his new friends. he loves fucking a barrel.   a few months later he gets there. high fives his buddies. everyone is on a good mood. he's even allowed to go first. he gets to the barrel. puts his dick in and..........weird. that feels horrible. he thrusts a little more. what the fuck. who broke the barrel? as he's about to turn around and start complaining he looks at his friends and they all seem equally confused. mike speaks up and says.

"[long]so, a pianist walks into his local jazz bar... as he's been down on his luck and is looking for work. he asks one of the waitresses there to speak to the manager, who he approaches and asks,   ""are you the dumb fucker that runs this shit hole of a bar?""   the manager, taken very much aback, responds, ""excuse me? i am the manager, yes, can you please stop swearing in front of my patrons?""  ""good! 'cause i need some fucking work and i'm half decent on the keys!""   and he sits down and begins to play the sweetest, grooviest, bluest-of-blues tracks the bar manager has ever heard.   ""d..did you write that? that was beautiful! what's it called?""   ""that i did! it's called, why don't you go fuck the ass off of a low flying duck you insolent cunt?""   aghast, the manager gestures for the pianist to hush, and quietly asks ""do you know any jazz? anything a little more intricate?""   ""'course i do!""   and again the pianist plays the most delightful and devilish jazz piece the manager has heard.   bracing for the name of this track, he asks ""well what do you call it?""   ""i'll fuck your mother's hairy minge under the cover of pale moonlight!""   appalled, though aware of the man's talents, the manager offers him a spot on the bill, on the proviso that he doesn't name his songs after he plays them, and the pianist happily agrees.   *later that evening...*   about 5 from showtime, the pianist has set himself up on stage and is perusing the crowd, gauging the energy of the room, when he suddenly spies the most beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous woman he's ever seen - tight fitting red dress with red lipstick to match, high heels - you name it. after slight deliberation, and with the 5 minutes to spare, the pianist decides it a good idea to go try rub one out in the men's room, to ""deal with the stress of performing"", as he justifies it.   well, lo and behold it takes a little longer than 5 minutes, and the manager comes bursting into the bathroom (on the other side of the stall, mind you), and yells  ""christ mate, where have you been?! the people are getting agitated - you've a show to play! don't you fuck this up for me!""  before leaving the bathroom abrutply.   the pianist rages on with the task at hand, and after wrapping up he bursts from the bathroom back onto the stage and sets right to playing.   after his first song, the lovely woman he had spied earlier approaches him from the side of the stage, leans into his ear and whispers   ""excuse me, do you know your dick is hanging out of your pants and there's cum dribbling onto your shoe?""  stunned, the pianist turns to her and says   ""know it?! i wrote that fucking song!"""	1

3 brothers enter the hospital room of their dying parents who have lived a long life of exploring and treasure hunting. their parents greet them, and tell them of the last adventure they were unable to complete. âthereâs a cave down in south america, deep in the jungles of brazil. go there and find the treasure we have been searching for the last 20 years. we know the three of you will find it.â   the brothers leave to prepare for their journey, their hearts heavy from their parents passing, but set with vindictive courage determined to find this mysterious cave.   3 years later the brothers are hopeless, having found no evidence of such a cave in the brazilian jungles. they make it back to their parents house eventually... where they find a little glass bottle on top of the fridge, with a scroll rolled up inside.   the first brother uncorks the bottle and gets the scroll out, starting to unroll it. *crinkle crinkle* the paper is very brittle.  on it reveals a clear path through brazil to where this mysterious cave might be. they only wish they knew about this treasure map 3 years ago... but alas, their journey begins.  finally, within the brazilian forests they arrive at the steps of a vine-encased stairway surrounded by foliage. there is no sign or anything, but this is where their parentsâ treasure map led them to.   the brothers take each other by hand and begin to descend. after what seems like 1,000 steps they finally reach a dim torch-lit room with three doors. one door has a fire symbol. one door has a water symbol. and the last door has a question mark.  bewildered by these symbols the first brother decides to take one for the team and enters the fire door. it slams  behind him as he descends another 1,000 stairs. finally reaching the bottom he finds red rubies scattered about the floor in piles he could never have imagined! he begins gathering rubies into sacks he brought and once he picks up the last ruby.. he notices a fireball start to form in the corner of the room. so he lifts his sacks in an adrenaline-fueled rush and bee-lines it for the door, 1,000 stairs up. he just barely makes it out, slamming the door on the fireball behind him.   his brothers are impressed by his riches that he gathered! while also afraid that the fire door housed a killer fireball. but the second brother canât be outdone by the first.  he makes his way down the stairs of the water symbol door. making it to the bottom of the steps he finds sapphires scattered everywhere and begins to gather them up. he picks up the last sapphire and water immediately begins seeping in from all corners of the room... in a rushed panic he picks up his sacks of sapphires and trudges through the water, barely making it up the stairs and closing the door before the water level rose enough to kill him and his brothers.   the third brother is now wildly impressed with his first two brothersâ riches! and also terrified to open this third door and see what evils may linger behind a question mark symbol.   he gathers up some courage and enters. this time there are only 10 steps. he finds rubies, sapphires, emeralds, and diamonds galore! there are so many treasures he fills up 4, 5, 6 enormous sacks of gems and.. nothing happens. he picks up his treasures and barely manages to make it up those 10 steps with all the extra weight.   his brothers are astounded. how did you get all that treasure?! why did nothing attack you?!   nevertheless, the boys returned home with their respective treasures, feeling fulfilled by completing their parents goal.   the first brother celebrates by buying a nice house on a lake in texas, getting all sorts of fun toys and things to play with considering his newfound fortune. years go by, and one day there is a gas leak in his kitchen. as he leans in to examine the issue, a fireball explodes in his face and kills him in a fiery death.  the very same day years later, the second brother was out enjoying a margarita on the beach, in front of his new beach mansion. those sapphires really paid off for him to live a stress free life! that is until a tsunami forms faster than ever and engulfs the beach, claiming the second brotherâs life before he or his margarita knew it.   now the third brother hears about the tragic deaths of his brothers.. and recalls the fire door, and the water door which relate to his brothersâ deaths. since he doesnât know what to expect he begins to prepare for the worst. as he had saved his jewels and not lived an extravagant lifestyle the past few years, he had plenty of wealth to invest in a castle with a drawbridge and an alligator moat. an entire team of armed guards was set up for 24 hour lookout and protection.   weeks go by and there is no cause for any alarm. until one day where he gets a dispatch on his walkie-talkie, âpsshhhhk- hello sir, you may want to have a look at this.. uh, iâm not sure how else to describe it. we have identified a.. floating coffin? it seems to be headed in our direction at a steady pace.. just ominously floating.â  the brother immediately heads to the lookout tower to get a glimpse through binoculars. and then he sees it. the floating coffin has a big question mark on the front of it.. floating directly towards him 1,000 meters away. he immediately recognizes this as the question mark on the door where he found his treasures.   in a panic, he yells into his walkie talkie, âpsshhhk- attention all guards, do not let that thing into this castle. open fire, raise the drawbridge! do anything you have to do to protect me!!â   he then makes his way to the deepest, most secluded portion of his castle, ending up in a guest bathroom underground where he was holed up waiting for his fate to arrive.   his guards radio in as he starts to hear rumbling and crashing upstairs above him.   âpsshhhk- sir! sir.. we canât stop it. our bullets just bounce off of it! it just floated over the moat and crashed through our drawbridge!! it is coming for you.. we canââââ and the walkie falls silent.   in a panic the brother starts to look for anything he might be able to use to defend himself... he really is at a disadvantage in this guest bathroom as all he can find is an old rusty razor and a bottle of nyquil. he thinks just maybe he could try and slice at it with the razor and maybe use the bottle of nyquil as a projectile.   soon enough, he hears the coffin crashing through the outer door, and crash the bathroom door shatters into pieces as the big question mark fills his view. quickly, he throws the bottle of nyquil and lunges at the coffin with the razor in hand... but he swings at nothing.. the coffin had vanished into thin air as soon as the nyquil made contact.   and thatâs when he realized.. nyquil stops the coffin.	1

'who in their right minds would ever *choose* hell?' confidently, he says ""heaven, my master.""  god nods. instantly the priest is sent to the heaven.  the priest looks around and finds a single, modest house. there's a tiny garden nearby and a few animals graze in it silently. the priest, having lived a life of modesty, settles quickly into the life. for lunch, he's given bread and butter. for dinner, he's given bread and butter.  the next day, he finds bread and butter for breakfast. he wonders, 'maybe this is temporary.'  finding a tiny hole in the wall, he walks to it and peeps into what the status is in hell. he's shocked at what he sees.  a full banquet has been laid. people eat all kinds of fruits and sandwiches. they're drinking merrily and laughing. it doesn't look like hell at all, for the priest had imagined satan burning the men and women at stakes and laughing devilishly.  dissapointed at the lord's ways, but accepting them nevertheless he goes back to his hut.  for an entire week, he endures bread and butter. the silence around his hut suffocates him. unable to sustain it anymore, he walks to the lord.  ""why, if i've chosen heaven, am i treated so badly? where is my banquet and my half of fun? is my service all in vain? why do i have to eat the bread and butter every day?"" he laments.  god looks at the priest as if he has missed the obvious and says, ""well, we're not going to keep the kitchen busy and running just for one person, right?!"""	1

"an italian mama mrs. ravioli comes to visit her son anthony for dinner. he lives with a female roommate, maria. during the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty anthony's roommate is. over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between anthony and his roommate than met the eye.  reading his mom's thoughts, anthony volunteered, ""i know what you must be thinking, but i assure you, maria and i are just roommates.''  about a week later, maria came to anthony saying, ""ever since your mother came to dinner, i've been unable to find the silver sugar bowl. you don't suppose she took it, do you?""  ""well, i doubt it, but i'll email her, just to be sure.""  so he sat down and wrote an email:  dear mama,Â   âi'm not saying that you ""did"" take the sugar bowl from my house ; i'm not saying that you ""did not"" take it. but the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.â  your loving son anthony Â  several days later, anthony received a response email from his mama which read:  dear son,Â   ""i'm not-a saying that-a you ""do-a"" sleep-a with maria, and i'm not-a saying that-a you ""do not"" sleep-a with her. but-a the fact remains that-a if she was-a sleeping in her own bed-a, she-a would have found-a the sugar-a bowl by now.""  your loving mama."	1

"three bulls heard the rancher was bringing another bull onto the ranch. the first bull growled, ""i've been here five years. i'm not giving this new bull any of my 100 cows!"" the second bull snorted, ""i've been here three years and have earned my right to 50 cows. i'm keeping all my cows!"" the third grunted in agreement, ""i've only been here a year and so far, you guys have only let me have 10 cows. i may not be as big as you fellows, but i'm keeping all 10 of my cows!""  just then, an 18-wheeler pulls up in the pasture carrying the biggest bull they've ever seen.   at 4,700 pounds, each step he takes strains the steel ramp.  the first bull reconsiders, ""i think i can spare a few cows for our new friend.""  the second bull ponders, ""i actually have too many cows to take care of. i can spare a few. i'm certainly not looking for an argument.""  they look over at the third bull and find him pawing the dirt, shaking his horns and snorting.  laughing they said, ""son, don't be foolish! let him have some of your cows and live to tell about it!""  the third bull whimpered, ""hell, he can have all my cows!! i'm just making sure he knows i'm a bull!!"""	1

"there once was an old toymaker. his name was abram wright, and he had spend his entire life working on his craft. his only joy was to bring a smile on children's faces, by giving them the toys he made, entirely with his own two hands. he started working with wood, when he himself was a kid, and made the most wonderful dolls; then he started working with metal, and made the most ingenious automatons; and then he learned to use various tools and materials, and brought to life the most marvelous, almost living toys.  one day, the old man felt he was going to die. he had led a fulfilling life, and caused many a smile; he was happy; though in his heart, he couldn't help but regret seing the end of it. he dreamt of making children happy forever.abram was beloved and respected by all. when the townsfolk heard that his end was near, they went and ask the authorities to help him. one day, as abram was lying, his restlest hands still making small wooden toys, even on his deathbed, there was a knock on his door. an important sounding man was there, clothed in army colors. he told the old toymaker that his life was too great, that he was too important to be left to die. the joy he has brought was extraordinary. ""we want you to keep making the children happy"", he told him, ""and we have just the technology for you to do that. we can extract your mind from your brain, and then put it back somewhere it could thrive. there is just one problem we still haven't solved: we can't create a proper recipient. a human brain cannot accept a different mind than its own, so we need a mechanical one. and no one, but you, is skilled enough to make one. build yourself an automaton, a puppet with a brain intricate enough to contain your mind, and we will put you into it, so you can live forever.""  abram was happy. he didn't want to die yet, he wanted to stay and make even more toys. so he got out of his bed, and he got to work. the army had given him everything he could possibly need: every material that existed on the world, the most advanced technologies, and all the hands he wanted. he worked tirelessly, days and nights, creating the most advanced toy he had ever made. and then, finally, it was done.  ""mr wright"", said the general, ""you have worked well. but we now face a new problem: we made tests on your creation. our technology should work, yet somehow any brain we transplant fails to animate this vessel. if your mind also fails to fit your puppet, you will die."" ""i'm dying anyway"", answered the old man, ""i might as well take one last chance before i go.""  and so it was done, and it worked to perfection. abram fell asleep on a flesh body, and woke up in one made of wood, metal, and plastic. he couldn't feel anymore, he wasn't hungry anymore, he wasn't sleepy anymore; but he was alive. and he could still make toys. he had given himself slender hands, a limber and fast body, so not only could he still bring joy to everyone, but he could also repair the most intricate parts of himself as needed, and he could live forever. ""i don't understand why it worked"", said the general, ""but i am glad it did. you're now immortal, abram wright, so go and spread joy as it is you do.""  the toymaker was happy. both children and adults went to marvel as this big great toy that was making others. he was sworn to secrecy: no one would know that he was still alive. but he never cared. he spent his days playing with the children, and his nights making more toys for them. and he was happy.  one night, there was a strong knock on the door of his workshop. ""we know you are here, toymaker!"", yelled a powerful voice, ""come out, come out, we want to talk to you!"" abram opened the door, puzzled to discover two asian-looking men sharing the same face. they could have been twins, but somehow he could tell: they looked even too much alike. like the same man having the two same bodies. ""who are you?"", he asked in his mechanical voice. ""i am lee chan wong"", one of the man answered, ""and i seek to be immortal. i spent my life working on cloning myself, and i managed to put myself in a younger version of my body; but my science is imperfect, and i am dying fast. my clones can't hold out. i stole the technology to put one's brain in a mechanical one, now, i'm going to need you to build the body i will then inhabit.""  abram refused, but the two clones took him and started tearing him appart. his body was resilient, but not strong, and he could do nothing to fight the two men that were one. but the toymaker lived for nothing but his craft. he felt nothing but the need to bring joy. ""you can destroy me!"", he cried, ""but you can never make me pervert my toys!"". ""fine"", one of the clones said, ""if you're not going to give me a new brain, i will have to take yours.""  the poor toy could do nothing. the clones took him to their lab, where he recognized the technology that had brought his mind inside of his puppet; he was strapped to a table, and the machine was put in place. ""i have studied the intricacies of the brain for longer than a lifetime, mr wright. i know the technology hasn't worked on anyone but you, and though nobody can tell why, i will use my first clone to understand the process, and then my second clone will take your place.""  and so the poor toymaker's mind was erased. he layed there, powerless, as he heard the machines whirring sound getting closer; he felt the electric waves going into his mind, and then, he was gone.  but then, as the brain of his first clone dived into the mechanical one, lee realized his error. what he hadn't know about abram wright, what nobody had ever figured out, is that the man wasn't simply great: he was a genius. his brain could animate the machine because his mind was simply greater. the technology had worked only with him, because it simply couldn't work on anyone else. a normal mind was merely not enough to animate his greatest toy.  the cloning technology that lee had spent a lifetime developing had one curious side effect: it was not just his body, but also his mind, that was shared. he could feel, as if he were there himself, the anguish of his clone, stuck into his mechanical prison. he screamed and yelled and cried and fought and fought and fought, but he simply didn't have the strenght to make to automaton move. he didn't have enough brain. the desperate scientist knew what he had to do: one brain wasn't enough for the puppet to move, but two would surely be. he plugged himself into the machine, and sent his mind with his other self, inside the giant toy.  he saw the dark around him, as he couldn't see. he felt the absence on his limbs, as he couldn't feel. he heard the silence, as he couldn't hear. a wave of terror went crashing down on him, a double panic filling his double mind, as both brains came to the same realization: they had failed. two of the crazed scientist's brains weren't enough to animate the toy. crying a cry no one could hear, they stayed there, in a prison of wood, metal and plastic, burried inside the mechanical mind of a man too great for them to ever match.  &#x200b;  they should have known. two wongs do not make a wright."	1

this is a long showerthought, so read the description. there could be senses that exist that we donât know about because we donât have them. for example, if everyone in the world was blind, no one would believe that sight exists and grasp it, especially if it doesnât overlap any of their own perceptions. this means that what we perceive isnât all that there is. maybe there are other things that are in front of our faces that we canât  experience.  edit: this expands from the idea that you can prove something is real by experiencing it, but you cannot prove that something is not real by not experiencing it.	1

""well, that is wonderful,"" replies the husband.  his wife then says, ""you know, you haven't been exactly a ball of fire in the bedroom these last few years. why don't you go see the hypnotist and see if he can do anything for that?""  the husband agrees to try it.  following his appointment, the husband comes home, rips off his clothes, picks up his wife and carries her into the bedroom.  he puts her on the bed and says, ""don't move, i'll be right back."" he goes into the bathroom and comes back a few minutes later and jumps into bed and makes passionate love to his wife like never before.  his wife says, ""boy, that was wonderful!""  the husband says, ""don't move! i will be right back.""  he goes back into the bathroom, comes back and round two was even better than the first time.  the wife sits up and her head is spinning.  her husband again says, ""don't move, i'll be right back.""  with that, he goes back in the bathroom.  this time, his wife quietly follows him and there, in the bathroom, she sees him standing at the mirror and saying,  she's not my wife! she's not my wife! she's not my wife!""  his funeral service will be held on saturday."	1
"a man wakes up in a slum with no idea how he got there. man wakes up in a slum with no memory of how he got there.  he wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.  ""you're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""but you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""  all of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. the man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. when the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. only then does the man realize how hungry he is. a guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.  the beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""that one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. all the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. i've heard the food is better there.""  so the man gets his food. it's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. the guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. it's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. all the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. and to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.  ""what are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. the beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. when the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. on a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. a cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. the beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""that's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" the man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.  while he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""the best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. you can never get tired of it!""  sadly, this proved not to be true. after only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. but he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. this time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. after ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. he went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.  and wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. the man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""come,"" the beggar told him, ""i'll take you to the evening meal."" so the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. and sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. one of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""that's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals four times a year!""  the man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. four changes a year was enough for him. but one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""what is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what i have here?"" that question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. he was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.  fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. when he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. the architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. to his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.  the beggar laughed jovially. ""i got here only three years ago myself, but somehow i knew you would be right here behind me. i've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. the room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. an angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.  smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""that's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.  ""what is it?"" the man asked his old friend.  the beggar replied, ""there appears to be no punchline."""	1

"an atheist decides he was to be jewish... an atheist is inspired by the jewish philosophy and approach to religion, how it's built around questioning and responding with more and deeper questions. he's not sold on the god stuff, but decides he can look past that if it means getting to engage with a thoughtful, inquisitive community.  so, he goes to see the local rabbi and ask about joining. the rabbi explains it's not so easy. there's a process, and it's a long one, and maybe easier to go back in time and be born to a jewish mother, if truth be told.  but, the atheist says those rules are outdated, and a religious community should be based only on shared beliefs.  the rabbi responds that part of those shared beliefs is a shared respect for the tradition.  but the atheist points out that the tradition is one of questioning the rules.  they go back and forth, on and on, neither giving an inch in the argument until finally the atheist is just exhausted and gives up saying, ""fine, i guess if you won't let me join there's nothing i can do about that.""  ""not let you join?"" the rabbi says, ""what do you think we've been doing this whole time?"""	1

"jesus and satan were arguing over whom should be able to walk the earth... god stepped in and told both of them to draft a detailed, 7 page, 10 font, mla format, report as to why they deserve it.  he gave them 1 day to complete the report.   as they both were furiously typing and conducting web searches, and citing away, the final hour was upon them.  all of the sudden, god sneezes and the power goes out.  when he returns the power, they are both becoming frantic.    as the hour closes, satan is even more red than ever.  he complains that god did it on purpose and that they need another dau, because he lost all of his work.  as god allows him to continue his tirade, jesus walks over and hands his completed report to god.  satan sees this and exclaims that jesus was cheating.  god just looks at him and says, ""no, jesus saves."""	1

"a couple took in an 18-year-old girl as a lodger. she asked if she could have a bath, but the woman of the house told her they didn't have a bath, although if she wanted to, she could use a tin bath in front of the fire.  ""monday's the best night, when my husband goes out to darts,"" she said.  the girl agreed to have a bath the following monday.  after her husband had gone to the pub for his darts match, the woman filled the bath and watched the girl get undressed.  she was surprised to see that the lass didn't have any pubic hair.  she mentioned this to her husband when he came home.  he didn't believe her, so she said: ""next monday, when you go to darts, leave a little early and wait in the back garden. i'll leave a gap in the curtains so you can see for yourself.""  so the following monday, while the girl again got undressed, the wife asked: ""do you shave?""   ""no,"" replied the girl. ""i've just never grown any hair down there. do you have hair?""  ""oh, yes,"" said the woman, and she pulled up her nightdress and showed the girl that she was really generously endowed in the hair department.  the girl finished her bath and went to bed.  later that night, when the husband came in, the wife asked him, ""did you see it?"" ""yes,"" he said, ""but why the hell did you have to show her yours.""  ""why ever are you worried about that?"" she said. ""you've seen it often enough before.""  ""i know,"" he said.... ""but the f*ckin darts team hadn't!"	1

"young man was wandering, lost, in a forest when he came upon a small house. knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient chinese man with a long, gray beard. ""i'm lost,"" said the man. ""can you put me up for the night?""  ""certainly,"" the chinese man said, ""but on one condition. if you so much as lay a finger on my daughter i will inflict upon you the three worst chinese tortures known to man.""  ""ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. she was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. she was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. but during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. he   was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.    he woke to feel a pressure on his chest. opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""chinese torture 1: large rock on chest."" ""well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""if that's the best the old man   can do then i don't have much to worry about."" he picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. as he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""chinese torture 2: rock tied to left testicle."" in a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. as he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""chinese torture 3: right testicle tied to bedpost."""	1

""i am the daughter of that witch. she lived in peace with the townsfolk for many years. but the new mayor, who is a violent and hateful man, rile the people up against her, and they burned her at stake. i am young and still do not know very much magic. i tried to curse them, but my curse fizzled. now i worry i will never avenge my mother's death.""  &#x200b;  ""do not be afraid,"" said the well. ""i will take care of this.""   &#x200b;  the next morning, when the mayor came to fetch water from the well, he heard an odd noise coming from the bottom. he peered over as far as he could to see what was happening. then an impossibly long arm shot up from the bottom of the well, grabbed the mayor, and pulled him into the well shaft. there was a horrible crunching sound, and nobody ever saw the mayor again. the townsfolk apologized to the witch's daughter, and they all lived happily after.   &#x200b;  moral of the story: living well is the best revenge."	1

""well,"" the woman says, ""a couple things, actually. i noticed you were wearing an iron maiden t-shirt. iron maiden are my favourite band of all time. when they went on their reunion tour in 1999 my parents took me to see them in cleveland. i was 12 years old, it was the first concert i ever went to. i absolutely love iron maiden.

colonoscopy journal: &#x200b;  i called my friend andy sable, a gastroenterologist, to make an appointment for a colonoscopy.  a few days later, in his office, andy showed me a color diagram of the colon, a lengthy organ that appears to go all over the place, at one point passing briefly through minneapolis.  then andy explained the colonoscopy procedure to me in a thorough, reassuring, and patient manner.  i nodded thoughtfully, but i didn't really hear anything he said, because my brain was shrieking, 'he's going to stick a tube 17,000 feet up your behind!'  i left andy's office with some written instructions, and a prescription for a product called 'moviprep,' which comes in a box large enough to hold a microwave oven. i will discuss moviprep in detail later; for now, suffice it to say that we must never allow it to fall into the hands of america 's enemies..  i spent the next several days productively sitting around being nervous.  then, on the day before my colonoscopy, i began my preparation. in accordance with my instructions, i didn't eat any solid food that day; all i had was chicken broth, which is basically water, only with less flavor.  then, in the evening, i took the moviprep. you mix two packets of powder together in a one-liter plastic jug, then you fill it with lukewarm water. (for those unfamiliar with the metric system, a liter is about 32 gallons). then you have to drink the whole jug. this takes about an hour because moviprep tastes - and here i am being kind - like a mixture of goat spit and urinal cleanser, with just a hint of lemon.  the instructions for moviprep, clearly written by somebody with a great sense of humor, state that after you drink it, 'a loose, watery bowel movement may result.'  this is kind of like saying that after you jump off your roof, you may experience contact with the ground.  moviprep is a nuclear laxative. i don't want to be too graphic, here, but, have you ever seen a space-shuttle launch? this is pretty much the moviprep experience, with you as the shuttle. there are times when you wish the commode had a seat belt. you spend several hours pretty much confined to the bathroom, spurting violently. you eliminate everything. and then, when you figure you must be totally empty, you have to drink another liter of moviprep, at which point, as far as i can tell, your bowels travel into the future and start eliminating food that you have not even eaten yet.  after an action-packed evening, i finally got to sleep.  the next morning my wife drove me to the clinic. i was very nervous. not only was i worried about the procedure, but i had been experiencing occasional return bouts of moviprep spurtage. i was thinking, 'what if i spurt on andy?' how do you apologize to a friend for something like that? flowers would not be enough.  at the clinic, i had to sign many forms acknowledging that i understood and totally agreed with whatever the heck the forms said. then they led me to a room full of other colonoscopy people, where i went inside a little curtained space and took off my clothes and put on one of those hospital garments designed by sadist perverts, the kind that, when you put it on, makes you feel even more naked than when you are actually naked..  then a nurse named eddie put a little needle in a vein in my left hand. ordinarily, i would have fainted, but eddie was very good, and i was already lying down. eddie also told me that some people put vodka in their moviprep.  at first, i was ticked off that i hadn't thought of this, but then i pondered what would happen if you got yourself too tipsy to make it to the bathroom, so you were staggering around in full fire hose mode. you would have no choice but to burn your house.  when everything was ready, eddie wheeled me into the procedure room, where andy was waiting with a nurse and an anesthesiologist. i did not see the 17,000-foot tube, but i knew andy had it hidden around there somewhere. i was seriously nervous at this point.  andy had me roll over on my left side, and the anesthesiologist began hooking something up to the needle in my hand.  there was music playing in the room, and i realized that the song was 'dancing queen' by abba. i remarked to andy that, of all the songs that could be playing during this particular procedure, 'dancing queen' had to be the least appropriate.  'you want me to turn it up?' said andy, from somewhere behind me.  'ha ha,' i said. and then it was time, the moment i had been dreading for more than a decade. if you are squeamish, prepare yourself, because i am going to tell you, in explicit detail, exactly what it was like.  i have no idea. really. i slept through it. one moment, abba was yelling 'dancing queen, feel the beat of the tambourine,' and the next moment, i was back in the other room, waking up in a very mellow mood.  andy was looking down at me and asking me how i felt. i felt excellent. i felt even more excellent when andy told me that it was all over and that my colon had passed with flying colors. i have never been prouder of an internal organ.  on the subject of colonoscopies...  colonoscopies are no joke, but these comments during the exam were quite humorous..... a physician claimed that the following are actual comments made by his patients (predominately male) while he was performing their colonoscopies:  1. take it easy doc. you're boldly going where no man has gone before.  2. 'find amelia earhart yet?'  3. 'can you hear me now?'  4. 'are we there yet? are we there yet? are we there yet?'  5. 'you know, in arkansas, we're now legally married.'  6. 'any sign of the trapped miners, chief?'  7. 'you put your left hand in, you take your left hand out...'  8. 'hey! now i know how a muppet feels!'  9. 'if your hand doesn't fit, you must quit!'  10. 'hey doc, let me know if you find my dignity.'  11. 'you used to be an executive at enron, didn't you?'  12. 'god, now i know why i am not gay.'  and the best one of all:  13. 'could you write a note for my wife saying that my head is not up there?'	1

"a middle aged man was walking home one friday . instead of taking his company bus he decided to walk up the mountain road ,see the beautiful sunset and take a train on the other side. his time calculation went wrong and it became dark ,he was still on the inclined mountain road .while walking hurriedly he noticed shadow of a man standing near a dim incandescent lamp post .by his standing posture he looked like an old man. he was wearing a baggy cloak seem to have made a century ago. he was holding a book in his hand . the middle aged man tried to engage in a conversation by asking the time .the old man nodded in a way showing he doesn't know and doesn't care. the man couldn't resist and asked ""what are you holding there"". the old man answered ""it's the last thing a mortal should own"". amused by this statement the man asked more about the book to which the old man answered ""the owner of this book becomes rich and gets everything he wants"" . the man got interested and asked the old man to sell him that book. the old man said ""10,000 dollars"" . the man being highly superstitious paid the price and bought the book. as he was leaving down the mountain road the old man stopped him to warn about the book saying ""whatever you do with it ,never open the last page ,or you will die"". the man left rather happily inspite of the warning. from that day forward the man quit his job , bought a big villa and a sports car on loan and mortgage from his smaller house. he waited for his days to change and started day dreaming about more expensive things thinking the book will show its magic. but that never happened. after being in debt for years he finally lost his patience and decided to take a look at the last page of the book. he slowly opened the book and saw all pages were empty .he never looked at the pages before as he was only interested in the outcome of owning the book. fearing for his life he opened the last page and died instantly of cardiac arrest. the last page said ""hard bound ,unruled. $8.99"""	1

a cowboy had spent many days crossing the montana prairies without water. his horse had already died of thirst. he's crawling along the dusty ground, certain that he has breathed his last breath, when all of a sudden he sees an object sticking out of the ground several yards ahead of him.Â   he crawls to the object, pulls it out of the ground and discovers what looks to be an old briefcase. he opens it and out pops a genie.Â   but this is no ordinary genie.Â she is wearing an irs id badge and a dull grey dress.Â there's a calculator in her pocketbook.  she has a pencil tucked behind one ear. 'well, cowboy,' says the genie, 'you know how i work....you have three wishes.'Â   'i'm not falling for this,' said the cowboy, 'i'm not going to trust an irs genie.'Â   'what do you have to lose? you've got no transportation, and it looks like you're a goner anyway!'Â   the cowboy thinks about this for a minute and decides that the genie is right.Â   'ok! i wish i were along-side a lush spring with plenty of food and drink.'Â   --poof-- the cowboy finds himself beside the most beautiful spring he has ever seen, and he's surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies.Â   'ok, cowpoke, what's your second wish.'Â  'my second wish is that i was rich...beyond my wildest dreams.'Â   --poof-- the cowboy finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare gold coins and precious gems.Â   'ok, cowpuncher, you have just one more wish.Â  better make it a good one!'Â   after thinking for a few minutes, the cowboy says, 'i wish that no matter where i go, beautiful women will want and need me.'  Â -- poof -- he was turned into a tampon.Â   moral of the story:Â  if the u.s. government offers to help you, there's going to be a stringÂ attached.	1

"a few months ago, there was an opening with the cia for an assassin. these highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there's a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position. after sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to two men and a woman, but only one position was available.  the day came for the final test to see which person would get the extremely secretive job. the cia men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. ""we must know that you will follow our instructions whatever the circumstances,"" they explained. ""inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. take this gun and kill her."" the man looked horrified and said, ""you can't be serious! i could never shoot my wife!""  ""well,"" said the cia man, ""you're definitely not the right man for this job then.""  so they brought the second man to the same door and handed him a gun. ""we must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances,"" they explained to the second man. ""inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair. take this gun and kill her."" the second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went in the room. all was quiet for about 5 minutes; then the door opened. the man came out of the room with tears in his eyes. ""i tried to shoot her; i just couldn't pull the trigger and shoot my wife. i guess i'm not the right man for the job.""  ""no,"" the cia man replied, ""you don't have what it takes. take your wife and go home.""  now they only had the woman left to test. they led her to the same door to the same room and handed her the same gun. ""we must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances; this is your final test. inside you will find your husband sitting in a chair. take this gun and kill him."" the woman took the gun and opened the door. before the door even closed all the way, the cia men heard the gun start firing, one shot after another for 13 shots. then all hell broke loose in the room. they heard screaming, rashing, and banging on the walls. this went on for several minutes; then all went quiet.  the door opened slowly, and there stood the woman. she wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""you guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks. i had to beat the son of a bitch to death with the chair!â"	1

"roadkill on m42 the highways agency found over 200 dead crows on the m42 near birmingham recently, and there was concern that they may have died from avian flu. a pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was not avian flu.   the cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. however, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. by analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.  the agency then hired an ornithological behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. the ornithological behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger.   they discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout âcah"", not a single one could shout âmotorcycleâ"	1

""how come we don't get a fuckin' bonus? we work here the same as everyone else!""   the owner sighed and looked back at his papers, replying in broken english ""none of you concerned it.""   when the worker went back to tell his friends, the second man broke into his office. ""the fuck you mean it's none of our concern?! that's our money, same as everyone else!""  again, the owner shook his head, not even looking up. ""none of you concerned it.""  after telling his friends he got the same broken reply, the third friend had had enough. throwing open the door, he slammed his fist on the desk.  ""now look, you old wanker. i don't know how you ran things in laos, but here, when someone does a good job and doesn't get a bonus, it's sure as shit not 'none of our concerned it!'"" he shouted, mocking the owner's accent.  the owner sighed, pulled off his glasses and faced the man. ""that's all well and good,"" he said. ""however, i worked very hard to get to this point, earning two master's degrees in business and english.""  he went back to his papers. ""so feel free to look for another job. but trust me when i say that none of you cunts earned it."""	1

"two whales are swimming along in the ocean... when one whale spots a fishing boat. so he says to the other whale ""hey, that is the boat that harpooned frank, we should get back at them""  the other whale says ""oh yeah? what should we do?""  ""i say we both go under their boat, and blow our blowholes as hard as we can, that will knock over their boat!"" and so both whales went under the boat, and with a powerful blast they were able to capsize the boat and send all the sailors into the water.  the first whale then says ""now that they are all in the water, i say we eat them!""  and the second whale replies ""woah, woah, woah. i was all for the blow job but i won't swallow any seamen""."	1

mr. becker was a cantankerous old farmer but he owns some best land in the valley for deer hunting.  people had asked permission to hunt on his land forever and always ended up hightailing out of there to escape the barrage of expletives hurled at them and a potential for a dusting of rock salt out of his shotgun.    my buddy cory and i had dreamed for years of getting to hunt on his land.  we both knew him and had a somewhat peaceful relationship since we both spent a few days helping him bale hay when his hired hand vaporized in the middle of the night.  we assume he had enough and packed up and left.  we pulled into the yard and after a quick game of rock, paper, scissors i had the task of going up and asking.  we felt it better for one to make a fast exit and the other ready to peel out of there.    surprisingly when i was greeted at the door by a fairly peaceful mr. becker.  he remembered what we had done for him and was appreciative for the help.  when i finally got up the courage to ask him he stared at me, thinking hard.  finally he said just this year we could hunt the eastern edge of his land, just the two of us and thatâs it...no others!  he did have one stipulation,  he had an old goat out behind the barn that needed to be put down.  he actually liked the old goat and didnât want to do it himself.  i agreed and headed back to the pickup with the amazing news, hey a little edge to hunt was better than nothing.  getting close to the truck i thought this was a perfect chance to screw with coryâs mind!    i opened the truck door and told him,  that old bastard said no...after all we did for him no!  cory was ready to put the truck in gear and get the heck out of there until i said...that old bastard,  iâm going to go back and shoot his pet goat!   i grabbed my rifle out of the back of the truck and before cory could quit stuttering in surprise i was on my way to his barn.  the old goat was sleeping and never knew a thing.  i started to head back to the truck when i heard 2 shots, then here comes cory running like a madman shouting get in the truck,  you shot his goat and i just shot two of his cow...	1

"an atheist in hell an atheist dies and goes to hell  the devil welcomes him and says:""let me show you around a little bit."" they walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace. ""this is your house now, here are your keys."" the man is happy and thanks the devil. the devil says:""no need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!""  they continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. ""these are your cars now!"" and hands the man all the car keys. again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says ""everyone down here gets some cool cars! how would you drive around without having cars?"".  they walk on and the area gets even nicer. there are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. they arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. she looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. the man couldnÂ´t be any happier. the devil says ""everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we donÂ´t want anyone to be lonely!""  as they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. he peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. there are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. a stench of sulfur is in the air.  terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""what is going on there?"" the devil just shrugs and says: ""those are the christians, i donÂ´t know why, but they prefer it that way""."	1

one day, keanu reeves is leaving his house... on his way out, his home is surrounded by paparazzi. looking into the crowds, he sees 20 people or so, and standing in between all of them, is a rather large machine. he hides his face and quickly rushes to his car.   keanu, knowing how to elude the paparazzi where possible, drives a rather round about way, and eventually arrives at the site of his newest film. when he gets there, he realizes some of the paparazzi have followed him. looking now, there is about 10 people, and still between all of them, there is a rather large machine.  he quickly ducks into an alley way and tries to lose them, running for blocks and blocks, going in and out of shops. eventually, looking back, he is all alone. he makes his way down the street until he hears a metallic clunking behind him. when he looks back, he sees the rather large machine, this time standing alone on the sidewalk. he continues to move until he hears the clunking again. looking back, the rather large machine has gotten closer, now knocking over mailboxes, and civilians along the way.  keanu breaks into a full sprint but the clunking only gets louder. his heart is pounding as the rather large machine gets closer and closer. eventually, he has had enough, and whips around angrily. just as he is about to begin yelling furiously though, he is caught of guard by a giant gust of wind to the face, his hair whips around and he cant so much as force a word out as he is overwhelmed.  when the airflow finally breaks, keanu says âi am sorry, i thought you were with the paparazzi!â  the rather large machine responds: âheavens no! im just a really big fan!â	1

""a bus was crushed in an avalanche fifteen minutes ago,"" said the reporter. ""everyone on the bus was killed."" the optimist and the pessimist recognized the bus as the one they had gotten off.  ""see?"" said the optimist. ""i told you something good would happen if we got off the bus!""  ""good?"" sputtered the pessimist. ""if the bus hadn't stopped to let us off, it might have missed the avalanche!"""	1

i dont have any regrets for what i did last year.... it's my humble request to read this calmly before making an opinion about me. and i tell you all again. i have no regret for what i have done.   when i was about 17 or 18, i first noticed that my sister was a hottie. first of all, - just for some background: my mum died right when i was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. i guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) i actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before i was born. so you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.  anyways, growing up i feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. when i was about 17 or 18 i first noticed that my sister was a hottie.  i don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that i accidentally found a video that she made of herself. i knew she didn't make it for me- but i thought she was so fucking beautiful that i watched it twice. i probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time i found the video, all this crazy shit went down and i had to leave home. (my dad's family who i was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. i never talk about it).  sooo... i was totally lusting after my sister at that point. she was also having bad trouble with the law. she was actually in custody when i left home.  my friend and i went to go pick her up. when i saw her that day, after seeing the video, i have to be honest, i just wanted to fuck her brains out. looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but i think she had feelings for me too. she actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? i mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.  after we left, we all went to crash with my sister's friends. on the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my sister, and i got a little jealous. he's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- i just felt like he was competition. not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. i'm not saying that i'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.  my friend and my sister never hooked up i don't think- but i thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. it was around that time that i got really badly hurt in an accident. it was fucked up. i almost died. but when i was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.  sadly (although, i guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. we spent some time apart... and i started to get really religious, so i tried not to think of her that way. it was actually going well for a long time- like i was totally over her.  but i have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini i've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. sigh.  a little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). i can't say i was surprised. but even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and i were outside alone.  it was a really intimate moment. i think something might have happened, except that i killed the mood when i told her that darth vader was our father and that i had to go face him.	1

"an atheist was taking a walk through the woods, admiring all that the ""accident of evolution"" had created. as he walked alongside the river, he heard a rustling in the bushes behind him. he turned to see a seven-foot tall grizzly bear charging right at him! he ran back up the path, with the bear close behind. his heart was pumping frantically as he tried to run faster. he looked over his shoulder as the bear closed in. he suddenly tripped and fell to the floor.  he rolled over to pick himself up, but he saw the bear, right on top of him, raising his paw above him to strike. at that instant, the atheist, without thinking, cried out, ""oh my god!""  time stopped. the bear was frozen in place. the forest was silent. even the river stopped moving. all of a sudden, a bright light shined down from heaven. a voice thundered, ""you deny my existence for all these years, teach others i don't exist, and even credit creation to a cosmic accident. do you expect me to help you now? am i to count you as a believer?""  the atheist thought for a second, then answered. ""it would be hypocritical of me to proclaim myself as a believer after all these years; but, perhaps you could spare my life by making the bear a believer in your laws.  ""very well"", said the voice. ""i'll try"".  the light vanished. the river started moving again. and then the bear put his paws together, bowed his head, and spoke:  ""lord, for this food which i am about to receive, i am truly thankful. amen."""	1

a joke thatâs got me various death threats so there was a horse, and this horse was really talented. he was great on guitar. one day he found himself watching youtube and stumbled upon a jimi hendrix song which inspired him to start a cover. he practised this cover really hard, eventually becoming inspired to create a cover of a whole jimi hendrix album.  he worked on this cover real hard, finally filming himself and uploading his hard work to youtube. it blows up, gets load of views, people love a horse playing guitar right? but something is missing so he goes to his friend the sheep and says âhey man youâre the best bass player i know, would you join my cover band?â to which the sheep agrees. they recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. it sounds great, blows up and gets loads of views.   still something is missing so he goes to his friend the cow and goes âhey man youâre like amazing at drums, could you join my cover band? itâd mean a lot!â and the cow says, âof course, youâre my buddy and that sounds great!â so again, they recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. it sounds great, blows up and gets loads of views.   but still something is missing. so finally the horse goes to his friend the chicken and says âhey man i think youâre the last element missing in our cover band - wanna be our vocalist?â and the chickenâs flattered. they recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. it sounds great, blows up and gets millions of views. it sounds almost as good as the original - by now everyone knows these guys have a talent and theyre forming a fanbase.   they have a healthy career as a cover band, maintaining and growing their fanbase infinitely. so one day the horse says to his band, âguys. we have all this talent - why donât we start writing our own music? what is there to lose?â so they start writing their own songs. by this point theyâre world-famous, playing tours, signing album covers and getting papped.  then one day the horse gets a call.  âhi, iâm ellen degeneres and i was wondering if your band would like to join me on my show? one of you will have to come on over to set things up first.â theyâre gobsmacked. theyâve finally made it, invited on the ellen show. after a brief discussion they agree the horse should have the honours of setting up with ellen, as he has founded their band. so he flies on over in a private jet, spends all day with ellen practising, sets up and goes back to his fancy five-star all inclusive hotel and pops open a bottle of champagne to himself and calls his friends up, saying âeverythingâs all ready, come on down.â   halfway through his third bottle, he gets a call.  âhi - is this horse? iâm so sorry. thereâs been an accident. your friends died in a plane crash.â  heâs devastated. his whole life, his best friends, everything heâs worked for. gone. in a flash. nothing remained. he decides - he has to kill himself. so he gets out of bed, already drunk, and wanders down the street in a dressing gown, stumbling into the shittiest, cheapest, most run down looking bar he could find in town.   he sits at the bar and says âa vodka on the rocksâ.   and the bartender goes, âhey man, why the long face?â	1

""noah!"" he roared, ""i'm about to start the rain! where is the ark ?""  ""forgive me, lord,"" begged noah, ""but! things have changed. i needed a  building permit. i've been arguing with the inspector about the need for a  sprinkler system. my neighbors claim that i've violated the neighborhood  zoning laws by building the ark in my yard and exceeding the height  limitations. we had to go to the development appeal board for a decision.  then the department of transportation demanded a bond be posted for the  future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear  the passage for the ark 's move to the sea. i told them that the sea would be  coming to us, but they would hear nothing of it.  getting the wood was another problem. there's a ban on cutting local  trees in order to save the spotted owl. i tried to convince the  environmentalists that i needed the wood to save the owls - but no go!  when i started gathering the animals, an animal rights group sued me.  they insisted that i was confining wild animals against their will. they  argued the accommodation was too restrictive, and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space.    then the epa ruled that i couldn't build the ark until they'd conducted an  environmental impact study on your proposed flood.  i'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the human rights commission  on how many minorities i'm supposed to hire for my building crew.  immigration and naturalization is checking the green-card status of most  of the people who want to work.  the trades unions say i can't use my sons. they insist i have to hire  only union workers with ark-building experience.  to make matters worse, the irs seized all my assets, claiming i'm trying  to leave the country illegally with endangered species.  so, forgive me, lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish  this ark. ""  suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow  stretched across the sky. noah looked up in wonder and asked, ""you mean you're not going to destroy the world?""

once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. for centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. one day, they decided to have it out, once and for all.   the first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. the night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons.   the second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. the night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner.   the third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. the night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor.   the next day, the battle began. all the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. the squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. so, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. the battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. the lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious.   and it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.	1

'we must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances.'  inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair... we need you to kill her' the man said, 'you can't be serious. i could never shoot my wife.' the agent said, 'then you're not the right man for this job. take your wife and go home.'  the second man was given the same instructions. he took the gun and went into the room. all was quiet for about 5 minutes. the man came out with tears in his eyes, 'i tried, but i can't kill my wife.' the agent said, 'you don't have what it takes. take your wife home.'  finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. he took the gun and went into the room. shots were heard, one after another. they heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. after a few minutes, all was quiet. the door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'some idiot loaded the gun with blanks' he said. 'i had to strangle that bitch to death'.	1

""no,"" she answered.  i then said, ""is that your final answer?""  she didn't even look at me this time, simply saying, ""yes.""  so i said, ""then i'd like to phone a friend.""  and then the fight started...  ----------  saturday morning i got up early, quietly dressed, made my lunch, grabbed the dog, and slipped quietly into the garage. i hooked up the boat up to the truck, and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour. the wind was blowing 50 mph, so i pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad all day.  i went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. i cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a different anticipation, and whispered, ""the weather out there is terrible.""  my loving wife of 10 years replied, ""can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that?""  and then the fight started...  ----------  i rear-ended a car this morning. so, there we were alongside the road and slowly the other driver got out of his car. you know how sometimes you just get soooo stressed and little things just seem funny? yeah, well i couldn't believe it.... he was a dwarf!!!  he stormed over to my car, looked up at me, and shouted, ""i am not happy !!!""  so, i looked down at him and said, ""well, then which one are you?""  and then the fight started...  ----------  my wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary.  she said, 'i want something shiny that goes from 0 to 150 in about 3 seconds.'  i bought her a bathroom scale.  and then the fight started...   ----------  when i got home last night, my wife demanded that i take her someplace expensive.  so, i took her to a gas station.  and then the fight started...   ----------  after retiring, i went to the social security office to apply for social security. the woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's license to verify my age. i looked in my pockets and realized i had left my wallet at home. i told the woman that i was very sorry, but i would have to go home and come back later.  the woman said, 'unbutton your shirt'. so i opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair. she said, 'that silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my social security application.  when i got home, i excitedly told my wife about my experience at the social security office.   she said, 'you should have dropped your pants. you might have gotten disability, too.'   and then the fight started...  ----------  my wife and i were sitting at a table at my high school reunion, and i kept staring at a drunken lady swigging her drink as she sat alone at a nearby table.   my wife asked, 'do you know her?'   'yes,' i sighed, 'she's my old girlfriend. i understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and i hear she hasn't been sober since.' Â  'my god!' says my wife, 'who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?'   and then the fight started...  ----------  i took my wife to a restaurant. the waiter, for some reason, took my order first.  Â  Â ""i'll have the strip steak, medium rare, please.""  he said, ""aren't you worried about the mad cow?""  ""nah, she can order for herself.""   and then the fight started...   ----------  a woman is standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror.  she is not happy with what she sees and says to her husband, 'i feel horrible; i look old, fat and ugly.  i really need you to pay me a compliment.'   the husband replies, 'your eyesight's damn near perfect.'   and then the fight started..."	1

(you get it). finally, they just can't take it anymore and they pull over to the side of the road near a cemetery and decide to drop their underwear and just go. one lady simply take off her underwear and wipe with those, but the other remembers that hers are a gift from her husband. however, she spotted a wreath that was on a grave and proceeded to wipe herself with it. after finishing, they went home. that weekends their husbands were at the pub chatting and one says, ""these ladies nights out are getting out of hand they really need to stop, last night my wife cam home with out any panties on."" the other man finishes his beer and says, ""you think that's bad... my wife came home with a card in her buttcrack that said 'on behalf of the whole fire department, we'll never forget you."""	1

"a son is choking a father and his young son go to a restaurant and to keep him occupied, he gives the boy three coins to play with.  suddenly, the boy starts choking and his face turning blue! the father realises the boy has swallowed the coins and starts slapping him on the back. the boy coughs up two of the coins, but keeps choking.  looking at his son, panicking, the father starts shouting for help.  a well-dressed, serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a nearby table reading from her laptop and sipping a cup of coffee.  at the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.  reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants, takes hold of the boy's balls and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.  after a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last coin, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.  releasing the boy's testicles, the woman walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word, but keeps the coin.  as soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her.  i've never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. are you a doctor?"" ""no"" the woman replied. ""i'm with the irs""."	1

"the scariest book of all time!! [long] there once lived an author named mr. troller. he was infamous as the writer of the scariest book ever. only three people ever bought his book and after reading his book , all the three guys passed away . the reason nobody bought his book was because it was damn expensive ($150,000) and nobody wanted to die after reading it.   but there was this one brave kid , who was only 12 years old at the time, who wanted to read it but could not afford it . so he made up his mind to work hard and earn enough money to buy it and read it. he started working at the age of 14 , had to quit school and had to work for another 25 years to be able to afford it . he then bought the book by shelling out all of his savings and wanted to prove to everyone that he was a really brave man.   he started to read the book. the book has 666 pages .he was half way through the book and yet found nothing scary at all. he read it till the page number 665 (last but one page). the last line of that page said ""do not read the last page unless you wanna die!!"". the guy mustered the courage to open the last page and reads it . in a couple minutes , he passes away.   nobody knew what could have caused the death of such an hard working man who wasn't a bit scared till he read the last page. so everyone opened the last page and read what it said:-  "" this story was copied from a $5 book that was written for kids. thanks for the money!!""  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  p.s - i am not sure if anyone else has posted a similar story because i joined a month ago, but if i have then i will delete it lol."	1

"a woman brings her dead husband to the funeral home the mortician comes out and says; ""madam, we have prepared everything for your husband's funeral tomorrow. we just wanted your comment on how he should look since mentioned wanting an open casket?""  the wife looks at her husband and bursts in tears; ""i'm sorry, but i see you've dressed him in his best black suit. well, he and i always agreed that he looked best in blue but we could never afford to get another suit of that quality and now it's too late.""  the mortician raises his hands and says; ""not to worry madam, we will arrange a new blue suit for him by tomorrow and we can sort out the costs afterwards, don't worry about a thing.""  the next day; the funeral goes ahead and everything is going well despite the morbid and tragic nature of the event. the wife gets up to say the eulogy and sees her husband in his casket. he is wearing a midnight blue tailored suit with a beautiful sky blue tie and brand new shoes. if he had not been dead, she would have said he never looked better.  after the service she goes up to the mortician and hugs him; ""thank you so much for everything, please tell me what it cost, i'll gladly pay anything!"" ""it is no trouble at all madam, and also no charge; after you left, another woman brought in her husband's body which was wearing a blue suit and we asked if she would be ok swapping. she was surprised but didn't mind at all.""

"a woman went to a synagogue in poland after the holocaust to record the history that was nearly lost forever, where she found an unusual tradition she had never seen before. at the synagogue, when they carried the torah\\*, they would bring it around to everyone who wanted to touch the torah, which was normal. but when they brought the torah down the center aisle, the carrier would get down on their knees and knee-walk all the way!  the woman had never heard of this tradition. there was no history of it that she knew of, and she had no idea what it could possibly mean. after the service, she went up to a congregant and said, ""i noticed that when the torah carrier got down on his knees! why is that?""  the congregant responded, ""the torah is a reflection of the world. when we carry the torah, we carry the world on our shoulders, and so we get down on our knees to represent the burden.""  ""that is incredible,"" said the woman. ""that is very poetic and i'm surprised i've never heard of this tradition before.""  the woman decided to ask another congregant a few minutes later. that congregant said, ""when we carry the torah we carry it before god. we get on our knees to represent the magnitude of god's presence upon us, but we continue forward in service to him.""  the woman again noted how incredible and poetic this explanation was, but realized that this was not the same explanation she had gotten from the last person. she continued to ask various congregants, each of whom had their own unique explanation. each and every explanation she came across was beautiful, but no two people had the same reason for carrying the torah on their knees down the center aisle.   after a time, she ran into a very old man. ""i remember when the tradition started, decades ago!"" he said. ""i know why we do it.""  the woman grew excited. she was finally going to learn the true reason for this beautiful, but obscure tradition!  ""this is a new building, because our old one was destroyed in the holocaust. when we first moved to that building, there was an enormous chandelier right in the middle, and it hung very low. when you carried the torah, it would hit the chandelier, so you had to get on your knees so you wouldn't hit it by accident!""  &#x200b;  \\*the torah is the holy book of the jewish people. while you can find them written in ordinary books, ""official"" torahs are written in large scrolls that are large, tall, and heavy, and thus difficult to carry.  &#x200b;  p:s: while this is a joke, it is also, as far as i know, a true story. and to all my fellow jews out there, shanah tovah!"	1

a mexican bandit made a specialty of crossing the rio grande from time to time and robbing banks in texas. the banks offered a reward for his capture, dead or alive, but offered a much larger award for the recovery of the stolen funds. an enterprising texas ranger decided to track him down. after a long and difficult search, he traced the bandit to his home town. on a hunch, he checked the townâs cantina, and sure enough, there was the robber. the only other people in the bar were the bartender and a scrawny, older man at a back table. the time was right to make a move. the ranger drew his revolver, charged into the cantina, and announced: âyou are under arrest. i get a reward for you, dead or alive. tell me where the money is, and iâll let you live. if you donât, iâll shoot you right here, and save myself the trouble of having to take you back to texas alive.â but the bandit didnât speak english, and the ranger didnât speak spanish. as it turned out, the scrawny man at the back of the bar happenedd to be a lawyer. he knew the robber, and was bilingual, and quickly offered to translate for the two of them. the ranger said: âtell him that if he doesnât tell me where the loot is, iâll shoot him here and now.â upon hearing what the ranger had said, and seeing the cold look in his eye, the bandit knew that the ranger meant it - if he did not give up his loot, he was a dead man. terrified, the bandit blurted out in spanish that the loot was buried in an old barn at the outskirts of town. âwhat did he say?â asked the ranger. the lawyer answered: âhe said, âyou donât have the nerve to shoot me, yankee swine.ââ	1

"a man starts his new job as a miner in a far away australian town. the town only exists for miners, and all the miners are men.  after a month on the job the man is very horny, but with no women in town he's out of luck.  one night in the bar he's talking to his fellow miners about his situation. he asks them how they deal with the loneliness.  they tell him ""we usually just ride the donkey out the back of the bar"". the man is sickened, but after another month he can't bare it, and asks the bar owner if he can use the donkey. he agrees.  when he gets back into the bar, the patrons ask how was it. he replies ""she put up a fight at first but eventually gave in. i feel better, but it's still weird. i don't think i'll fuck the donkey again"".  the patrons look at the man side eyed and say ""we usually ride the donkey to the brothel in the next town over""."	1

a girl from a strict family.    there was a girl from a very strict family.  her father absolutely hated fruits and no one in the family was allowed to eat them.  as far as the girl knew her uncle had died from choking on an apple which is why they were banned.    all through her school years she longed to taste any fruit, she watched her friends eat delicious apples and oranges.  saw other family members enjoying banana splits for dessert or cherry pie.  but she was an obedient child and did not want to disappoint her father so she maintained a very strict adherence to his rule about no fruit.    when she finally entered high school however she was starting to feel more rebellious, as teenagers often do, but her father was still very strict and she loved him very much.  now she also faced another problem, bullying.  her peers learned of her rule and picked on her for it every day.  the worst of them even mimicked choking on fruit because kids are very cruel sometimes.    she stuck it out however and dealt with it for her freshmen and sophomore years, but in her junior year it finally became too much.  she also started fighting with her dad about it, pleading with her mom, she just had to be allowed to eat fruit to stop the bullying, but nothing worked.  she just continued to be told she could eat whatever she wanted when she turned 18.  distraught and on the edge she wasn't looking forward to junior prom, but her friends were going so she at least had that.  while shopping for a dress with her mom her mom told her that every prom has a bowl of fruit juice, and since the delinquents tend to spike it she could drink from it and her father would just think she had alcohol.  he would never know!  this was it, now she was excited and in front of the whole school.  her friends noticed the change and were happy for her, the next few months were full of smiles and laughter missing from the girl for almost 2 years.  she was less affected by the snide remarks.  it was a long two months until the prom, and it dragged on with her new secret plan, but she made it through.  the night of prom finally arrived, her smile for pictures were big and genuine.  her dad thought she was just excited for prom and that it had led her to be less concerned about those terrible fruits for a while so he was happy too.  her mom winked as she left and made a drinking motion followed by a thumbs up.    it was time, she was so close now she could almost taste it.  she spilled the beans to her friends on the limo ride and they were shocked at her finally breaking with her father after all these years, but they were her friends and vowed to make it the best drink she'd ever had.  as soon as the limo pulled up to the door she was out and running into the gym, she could barely keep her balance running in her heels.  her friends were hot on her heels, they weren't going to miss this moment!    they entered the gym and were a bit dismayed to see a large amount of other students already waiting for the buffet, but the girl  had no chance of losing her excitement at that point.  how could she?  she had finally arrived at the punch line.	1

a man sits next to a mule with a sign that says â$10 to make my mule laugh. make him laugh and you win $100. a stranger in town sits on a park bench watches for a while. he sees a line of people try all kinds of crazy things to make the mule laugh. after a bit he walks over and talks to the mules owner. he finds out no one has ever made the mule laugh. he watches a bit longer before he pulls out $10 and hands it over to the owner. the stranger walks over to the mule, whispers in his ear and then stands back. the mule looks a him and then starts to chuckle. the chuckle turns into a laugh and soon the mule is rolling on the ground kicking his legs in his the air.   the owner walks over, hands the stranger $100 and asks, âwhatâd you say to my mule mister?â  the stranger similes, pockets the money, shakes his head and says he canât tell what he said before he leaves.   a year later the stranger returns and sees the same man, the same mule, but a different sign. this time the sign says â$20 to make my mule cry. make him cry and you win $200.â  again he watches for a while and sees people try all sorts of strange things. after a bit he goes over to the owner again. the owner gives him a wary look but takes his $20. he tells the stranger he can do anything he wants but he canât physically harm the mule in any way. the stranger asks if he can take the mule behind a nearby shed and promises not to harm the mule. with some reluctance the owner agrees. when the mule sees the stranger, he starts to chuckle and continues to do so as heâs led behind the shed. when he comes back a minute later the stranger is leading a sobbing mule.   the owner walks over wide eyed holding $200. this time the owner refuses to hand over the money until the stranger reveals how he made the mule cry. the stranger hesitates for a few seconds and then shrugs and smiles. âlast year i told your mule i had a bigger cock than he did. he thought that was funny. this time i proved it to him.â  note: a high schooler told me this joke when i was in jr high. he was my instant hero.	1

""hey deer! what you doing bro? getting high? you're wasting your life away! come with us. let's go for a run instead! running is healthy, and there's no better feeling than health!""  the deer, nervous from being called out by his peers, and not wanting to be the only loser using drugs, decides ""you guys are right. what's the point? this is a habit i need to kick!"" and rips the paper and throws the weed away, and the three take off on their run.  a bit farther down the path, they run into a squirrel, in his tiny little hands is a tiny little paper and a tiny amount of weed, in the process of being rolled into a tiny little joint. the rabbit, being at the front of the group, stops right in front of the squirrel.  ""hey squirrel! what you doing bro? drugs again? aren't you bored of the same old shit? come with us, bro. let's go for a run instead! running is healthy, and there's no better feeling than health!""  the squirrel, being a friend of the deer and the fox, and painfully aware that he usually gets invitations from them to smoke and he never returns the favor, curses his own selfishness and decides ""you guys are right. this isn't who i want to be. enough of this!"" and rips the tiny paper and throws the bit of weed away, and the four take off on their run.  a bit further down the path, as they get closer to a clearing, they start to smell the stench of marijuana. when they arrive at the clearing they see a monkey with a bong in his hand letting out a massive cloud of smoke, and when he notices the rabbit, he immediately starts giggling.  ""oh, rabbit!"" he says, when the giggles subside. ""you always do this! every time i get you high, you take off running!"""	1

""there's no point of us arguing. let's go and ask the man""  the students managed to get to the old man and because he was moving very slowly it wasn't hard.  one of the students said to the man, ""excuse us, sir. we're so sorry if we disturbed you. we're medicine students so couldn't help but notice the difficulty you have with walking. i analyzed the way you walk and concluded that this is a birth defect.""  the other student said, ""and i think you have suffered some sort of injury much later in life. which of us is correct?""  the man sighed and said, ""just like you too even i had come to a conclusion but it looks like we're all wrong.""  surprised at this one student asked, ""sorry sir, we do not understand  can you please elaborate?""  the old man replied, ""you thought it was a birth defect, you thought it was an injury and i thought it was just a fart!"""	1

a joke i will always love in the distant future when interstellar space travel is common place, scientists are traveling through galaxies to find life on other planets. on one planter many light years away, they find a giant granite statue statue of a man in a squatting position. upon close inspection they find this statue is alive, yet has no active bodily function that would show. it has lungs but they do not breath, legs that do not walk, and a brain that does not fire neurons.  this baffles scientists for decades till one high tempered scientist has had enough and screams out in front of it, âhow could evolution create a creature that has lungs but doesnât breath, legs but dosent walk, and a brain that dosent fire neurons!â the statue then rises from its squatting position, thinks for a moment, then bellows âit cannot.â afterwards it returns to itâs squatting position. the scientist is ecstatic, and in a voice filled with realization he exclaims  âegads! it only stands to reason!â	1

moeâs saloon in the old west was seeing a lot of customers lately... it was getting busier and busier by the day, so much so that there was barely a seat left in the whole joint. the hotshots were playing poker, the 49-ers were drinking and cat-calling the dames. the piano was playing, the whiskey was flowing, everyone was having the time of their lives. suddenly, the doors to moeâs saloon slam open. a scrawny, ragged, dirty little fellow starts screeching âgood folks, run for your lives! terrible jackâs on his way here!â. everybody rushes to leave, it was every man for himself. old moe just locked away the good silverware and was about to leave when the doors slam open again. a huge, dark and stern cowboy starts for the bar. every footstep was heavier than the last. poor moe froze behind the counter. the cowboy unzips his pants and slams against the counter this huge monster of a penis. pointing at it, he tells moe âbarkeep. suck.  on. it. fast.â poor moe does as heâs told without a beat. the cowboy leaves.  next day, same story. people having a blast, piano playing, whiskey flowing. the same haggard little man bursts in: âgood folks, run for your lives! terrible jackâs on his way here!â. panic ensues, everyone leaves in a frenzied manner, except for poor old moe, who, like a shipâs captain, was the one to stay behind. the same dark stern cowboy enters, advances to the counter, slams the hugest, ugliest phallus youâd ever seen, points at it and tells poor moe âbarkeep. suck. on. it. fast.â the old timer complies without a word.  third day, yet again the same story. wonderful time at moeâs saloon when a tiny little scamp enters and yells âgood folks, run for your lives! terrible jackâs on his way here!â. in a jiffy the place is emptied, old moe rushes for the exit when he bumps into the dark stern cowboy entering. he points to the counter. old moe obeys the order. the cowboy advances, unzips his pants and slams his horrible shlong on the counter: âbarkeep. suck. on. it. fastâ. moe considers for a moment, and, mustering all his might, whispers: âalright now, feller. alright. i done sucked that thing two days ago. didnât even wince. i done sucked that thing yesterday, not a word said. hell, iâll suck on it today, i give you my word. but - for the love of god - would you kindly tell me why you want it fast? iâm an old man and can barely pee fastâ  âheavenât. you. heard? terrible jackâs on his way here!â	1

""then i won't be able to represent you."" said the agent. ""then good day to you, sir!"" the man yelled as he stormed out of the office.  five years later, the agent received a letter along with a check for $50,000, written out to him. he wondered if it was sent to him by mistake until he read the letter.  the letter said,  dear sir, five years ago, i came into your office wanting to become an actor in hollywood and you told me i needed to change my name. determined to make it with my god-given birth name, i refused. you told me i would never make it in hollywood with a name like penis van lesbian. after i left your office, i thought about what you said. i decided you were right. i had to change my name. i had too much pride to return to your office, so i signed with another agent. i would never have made it without changing my name, so the enclosed check is a token of my appreciation. thank you for your advice..  sincerely,  dick van dyke"	1

"a russian, an american and a vietnamese were on a private plane together. at 10,000 feet, the plane started encountering some problems and the pilot announced: ""gentlemen, i'm afraid we are running out of fuel, we will need to throw our baggage away to reduce the weight if we wish to land safely!""  he then opened the door and asked the passengers to begin letting go of their stuff.  the russian unhesitantly threw a bag of expensive vodkas away. because of the loud wind, he had to shout at the other guys: ""don't worry! i have plenty of those back home!""  the american hesitated for a bit. he then threw a black suitcase off the door and shouted: ""it was 100,000$ cash. but don't worry, i can make that back in a day.""  the vietnamese did not have anything to throw away. he then looked at the american for a while and kicked him off the plane. the russian was in utter shock and screamed at the vietnamese: ""why did you kick him off the plane?   he then replied: ""don't worry! we have plenty of guys like him in vietnam!"""	1

"a father whale and his son are swimming when the son whale asks his father ""where did i come from."" the father whale replies ""from my penis son."" the son rolls his eyes and says ""thanks dad"" to which the father whale replies ""you're whale cum son, you're whale cum.""    at which point, the father whale was stricken by a long thin object which penetrated him with ease. he saw that it appeared to come from some large, shape floating at the surface.  another harpoon struck the father as his son gazed at him with terror and disbelief, he watched the life drain from his eyes.  multiple years later, a male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  the male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. he said to the female whale, ""lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink."" they tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.   soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, ""let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore."" at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. ""look,"" she said, ""i went along with the blow job, but i absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."""	1

a man walks into a bar a man walks into a bar that heâs never been to before. the place is busting and seems to be doing well. there are people singing, dancing, and laughing but the first thing he notices is the extremely short person playing piano in the middle of the boisterous crowd. everyone in the place is infatuated with the peculiar tiny musician.   he sits down at the counter and asks the bartender:   âwhatâs the deal with the piano player? he must be a foot tall!â   the bartender doesnât look up from the glassware heâs polishing. heâs answered this question many times:  âthatâs larry. heâs the house musician.â  the man, not satisfied with that answer goes on to ask:  âwhere the fuck did he come from? heâs making you a killing!â   the bartender leans in close to the man, smiles, and whispers:   âwell, i donât tell this to everyone, but you seem like a trustworthy guy.â  the man leans in closer.   the bartender nods towards an old dusty beer tap at the end of the bar and explains:   âsee that tap at the end of the bar? itâs magic.â  the man leans even closer.  the bartender goes on:  âbefore you take a sip of a beer poured from that tap, think of a wish and watch the magic happen. 10 years ago, thatâs how i ended up with larry and the bar has been a massive success ever since.   the man looks at the piano player, then turns towards the bartender and looks him dead in the eye:  âone beer please.â he nods at the old dusty tap. âthat one.â  the bartender pours his beer. the man thinks of his wish:  âi want a million bucks!â   he then chugs the beer in one go and slams the glass down on the bar. when he looks up, heâs surrounded by ducks. a millions of them.  frustrated, he says to the bartender:  âwtf! i wished for a million bucks, not a million ducks!â  the bartender responds apologetically:   âyeah itâs not perfect. you really think i would wish for a 12 inch pianist?â	1

"is hell endothermic or exothermic? most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using boyle's law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.  one student, however, wrote the following:  first, we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time. so we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into hell and the rate at which they are leaving. i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. therefore, no souls are leaving.  as for how many souls are entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to hell.  with birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because boyle's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the volume of hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.  this gives two possibilities: 1. if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose. 2. if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over. so which is it?  if we accept the postulate given to me by teresa during my freshman year that, ""it will be a cold day in hell before i go out with you"", and take into account the fact that i went out with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus i am sure that hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. the corollary of this theory is that since hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct . . . leaving only heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, teresa kept shouting ""oh my god.""  this student received the only ""a+""  credit: quora - what are the most profound jokes ever?"	1

a newly deceased englishman, stands at the pearly gates st. peter tells him that he cannot go to heaven right away because he cheated on his income taxes. the only way he might get into heaven would be to sleep with a stupid, ugly woman for the next five years and enjoy it. the englishman, decides that this is a small price to pay for an eternity in heaven. so off he goes with this woman, pretending to be happy. as he walks along, he sees his friend the scotsman, up ahead - with an even uglier woman.  when he asks whatâs going on, the scotsman replies âi cheated on my income taxes and scammed the government out of a lot of money.â they both shake their heads in understanding and figure that they might as well hang out together to help pass the time. now the englishman, and scotsman, and their two ugly women are walking along, minding their own business when they see someone who looks like their old friend the irishman up ahead.  this man is with an absolutely gorgeous blonde supermodel. stunned, the englishman, and scotsman approach the man and discover it is their friend the irishman. they ask him how it is heâs with this unbelievable goddess, while theyâre stuck with these god-awful women.  the irishman replies âi have no idea, but iâm definitely not complaining. this has been absolutely the best time of my life, and i have five years of the best sex any man could hope for to look forward to. there is only one thing that i canât seem to understand. everytime we finish having sex, she rolls over and murmurs to herself âfucking income taxâ	1

""jesus is probably smart enough to know that's a lie too.""  so to clear his mind and think better, the boy goes for a walk.  as he's walking down the street, he spots a manger scene on someones front lawn.  so he goes up to it, steals mary from the scene and takes it home.  as he goes to sit down, he already has the perfect idea of what he's going to write.

three park rangers are walking together through a wintry forest when they come upon a tiny leprechaun, shivering in the cold. the leprechaun asks the rangers for help escaping the snowy forest, and tells them that whoever can come up with the best and kindest way to transport him out of the forest, will be granted his pot of gold.  the first ranger offers him a limousine. âyou will be in the lap of luxury as you are driven out of the forest.â the leprechaun replied, âbut a limousine would never make it through the dense forest - it would never work.â  the second ranger offered him a horse drawn carriage. âwhat is more quaint and romantic than being carried by horses out of the cold and where you need to go?â the leprechaun replied, âbut the ride will be incredibly bumpy. iâll still be cold the entire trip and who knows if the horses could even survive such a trek! iâm sorry but this simply wonât work either.â   the third ranger thought for a moment and then said, âi will provide you with a tank. this will not only keep you out of the cold, but the tank can bulldoze itâs way through the forest easily and quickly.â  âthis is perfect! what a perfect and kind way to get me out of here! surely yours is the pot of gold.  tanks for the cold, kindest ranger!â	1

""brothers and sisters has he none, but this man's father is my father's only son. who is the man?""  the passenger thinks long and hard then shrugs. ""i give up. who?""  ""come on. think about it. brothers and sisters has he none... but this man's father is ***my*** father's only son. who must it be? it can't be anyone else.""  slightly aggravated by his own dullness, the passenger says ""i dunno. tell me. who is it?""  ""why it's me of course. my father's only son is me.""  ""ahh. good one."" replies the passenger and they continued the journey in silence save for his occasionally mumbling ""brothers and sisters has he none..."" quietly to himself.  he gets back to his house and later that evening announces to his wife that he has got a good riddle for her.  ""brothers and sisters has he none, but this man's father is my father's only son. who is the man?""  ""how the bloody hell should i know?!"" snaps his wife, without a moment's thought.

"research down under.. researchers for the australian roads department found over 200 dead crows on the great northern highway recently, and there was concern that they may have died from avian flu.  a bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely not avian flu. the cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts.  however, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. by analysing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.  they hired an ornithological behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.  the ornithological behaviourist very quickly concluded the cause:  when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.  they discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""cah"", not a single one could shout ""truck."" !!"	1

""no, i'm sorry, the nurse stated, ""but for this reading, i cannot use an oral thermometer."" this started another round of complaining, but eventually he rolled over and bared his rear end. after feeling the nurse insert the thermometer, he heard her announce, ""i have to get something. now you stay just like that until i get back.""  she leaves the door to his room open on her way out. he curses under his breath as he hears people walking past his door laughing. after almost an hour, the man's doctor comes into the room.

""sure mere few feet to the right, a small family made their way across not an hour ago"" meekly said the old-timer.   happy to shorten his journey the driver reins his horses across the stream. not a few steps in when the horses succumbed to the watery depth.  barely holding on to the bank the driver escaped the waters with his life intact while the horses drowned.  ""oy, you old fart, you said i could make my way across here. didn't you tell me that a small family made it across?""   the old man was puzzled,"" i dont get it. the family of ducks passed, and their legs were much shorter than the ones in your horses."""	1

""no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it."" so david and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,  ""david! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!""  although impressed, david's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells david that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.  ""no, no, just name anyone else,"" david says.  ""president trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.  ""yup,"" david says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go.  at the white house, trump spots david on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting the governor, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up, you know i don't give a shit about the governor.""  well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. after they leave the white house he expresses his doubts to david, who again implores him to name anyone else.  ""pope francis,"" his boss replies.  ""sure!"" says david. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.  david and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when david says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope."" he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.  sure enough, half an hour later david emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time david returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.  making his way to his boss' side, david asks him, ""what happened?""  his boss looks up and says, ""it was the final straw... you and the pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with david?'"	1

""i'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the human rights commission on how many minorities i'm supposed to hire for my building crew.""  ""the immigration dept. is checking the visa status of most of the people who want to work.""  ""the labor unions say i can't use my sons. they insist i have to hire only union workers with ark-building experience.""  ""to make matters worse, the irs seized all my assets, claiming i'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species.""  ""so, forgive me, lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark.""

"april and june were dating... the couple had been together many years, and, as far as one could tell from the outside were very happy together. but june had always felt as though there was something between them, something holding them back- something that april was keeping a secret.  as time went by, june got the impression that april was drifting away, and becoming colder. with every day, it felt as though the gap between them grew wider and wider. june had a suspicion as to what the cause might be- a little hussy by the name of may, who lived on the way from april's home to june's. june had seen the way may always made eyes at april when they walked past... she always looked smug, as though she knew something june didn't.  one day, the paranoia became simply too much for june. with nowhere else to turn, june enlisted the help of august, a private investigator, to track april's movements, and find out if there really were some grounds to june's fears.  august, a diligent detective, set about the task immediately, watching april night and day. no single action, no matter how trivial, escaped august's notice. each detail was meticulously recorded in a journal.  one day, about a week later, there was a knock at june's door. nervous to the point of shaking, june opened the door to find august, journal in hand, and with a solemn expression.  ""i have bad news, june...""  ""what? what is it?"" june panicked, grabbing august by the collar. ""tell me!""  ""i... don't know how to say this, june... i'm sorry. read the last entry...""  with a grimace, august handed june the notebook, already open to the most recent page. june's eyes scanned down the rows of neat notes, to the very last ones, listed as occuring just 20 minutes prior:  april showers.  brings may flowers."	1

a man is admitted to the hospital with chest pain. the cardiologist orders a battery of test over the course of a week. while studding the patient's ekg he noticed that his heart rate was very erratic when his wife and daughter were visiting.  the doctor asked the man how his relationship was with his family.  well i get along great with the 2 of them but they constantly fight and argue about anything and everything.  the dr replied great. if they stop fighting all the time you will probably live for another 40 or 50 years. however if they keep fighting you could die from the stress in a few months.  the man is greatly relieved and ask the doctor to call and tell his wife the prognosis.   he gets dressed and goes home. when he walks into his home his wife and daughter are crying uncontrollably. when his wife see him she throws her arms around him and sobs  the doctor just called and you only have 3 months to live.	1

john, who was in financial difficulty, walked into a church and started to pray. ''listen god,'' john said. ''i know i haven't been perfect but i really need to win the lottery. i don't have a lot of money. please help me out.'' he left the church, a week went by, and he hadn't won the lottery, so he walked into a synagogue. ''come on, god,'' he said. ''i really need this money. my mom needs surgery and i have bills to pay. please let me win the lottery.'' he left the synagogue, a week went by, and he didn't win the lottery. so, he went to a mosque and started to pray again. ''you're starting to disappoint me, god,'' he said. ''i've prayed and prayed. if you just let me win the lottery, i'll be a better person. i don't have to win the jackpot, just enough to get me out of debt. i'll give some to charity, even. just let me win the lottery.'' john thought this did it, so he got up and walked outside. the clouds opened up and a booming voice said, ''john, buy a fucking lottery ticket.''	1

"jokes from the 90's seem popular here. how about one from the 80's? little timmy had a severe stutter. however, his mother decided that this was no reason for him to not live a normal life, and so decided he should try taking the bus to school on his own.   ""it's very simple,"" she assured her nervous boy. ""when you board the bus tomorrow morning, tell the conductor, 'sir, i want to go to maple avenue.'""  so the next day, little timmy boarded the bus and said to the conductor, ""s-s-s-sir, i want t-t-t-to go to map-p-p-le avenue."" to his astonishment, the conductor clipped his ear before signalling the driver to move off. the day after that, he thought he'd try again. when the bus arrived, he said to the conductor, ""sir, t-t-t-t-take me to map-p-p-,"" and this time, he couldn't even finish before the conductor slapped him again.   when it happened yet again, timmy told his mother about it, and she decided to have it out with the conductor. accordingly, the next day, the bus arrived and there was the same person. timmy's mother angrily marched up onto the bus and demanded of the conductor, ""why do you keep hitting my son?""   the conductor flushed with anger, pointed at timmy and retorted, ""b-b-b-brat k-k-keeps mock-k-k-king me!"""	1

a woman brought a very limp duck to dr.santa, a veterinary surgeon.  as she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the duckâs chest.  after a moment or two, the vet shook his head sadly and said, âiâm sorry, your duck, cuddles, has passed away.â  the distressed woman wailed, âare you sure?â  âyes, i am sure. the duck is dead,â replied dr.santa.  âhow can you be so sure?â she protested. âi mean you havenât done any testing on him or anything. he might just be in a coma or something.â  the vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room.  he returned a few minutes later with a labrador. as the duckâs owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. he then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.  the vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room.  a few minutes later he returned with a cat. the cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. the cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.  the vet looked at the woman and said, âiâm sorry, but as i said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.â  dr.santa turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman. the duckâs owner, still in shock, took the bill. â$150!â she cried, â$150 just to tell me my duck is dead!â  the vet shrugged, âiâm sorry. if you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $10, but with the lab report and the cat scan, itâs now $150.â	1

why was 6 afraid of 7? 6 never did trust 7. sure, they worked closely together, but 7 always seemed at odds with him. 6 always preferred the company of 4, a perfect 10 of a duo, even though 2 kept them apart. but when it came to 7? 6 always summed it up to bad luck. then, 6 found the truth. 6 respected 9, even though lewd jokes always seemed to be made about the two. 6 found that 3 and himself could come together and be seen as equal to 9. when 9 was removed, 6 had a very negative feeling. some were considered prime suspects in 9âs death. 2, 3, 5, and 7. 6 knew it had to be 7. his involvement with 9 added up two well. 6 snuck into 7âs house. he looked up from the floorboards, and found himself under 7. an admittedly improper position for him, but 6 saw the proof he wanted: 9âs body, half devoured. 7 was a cannibal... 7 8 9. 6 has spent the remainder of his days terrified of 7, worried that someday 7 will learn what 6 knows... and promptly solve his problem.	1

""how long must this go on?"" he asked. ""this fighting   between our professions? this hatred? this animosity?   this spitting in shoes and peeing in cokes?"""	1

""there. now you have a bayonet. if the enemy gets close just yell stabbity. stabbity. stabbity!"". the soldier still perplexed ventured onto the battlefield nonetheless. he saw his enemy on the horizon and began shouting ""bangity! bangity! bangity!"" to his surprise the enemy was dropping like flies. except for one. they kept coming. getting closer and closer. once the enemy was right upon the soldier he began jabbing his wicker bayonet screaming, ""stabbity! stabbity! stabbity!"". but to no avail. the enemy rolled right over the soldier crushing every bone in his body and pressing him deep into the soil. as the enemy passed over him he could hear them saying, ""tankity! tankity! tankity!"""	1

paddy and mary are having some issues in the bedroom department paddy and mary are having some issues in the bedroom department so they go visit the doctor to see if he can help them out. Â mary tells the doctor that no matter what, she can never reach her special place when they make love.  the doctor examines them both and says âi canât find anything obviously wrong with either of you. but mary, i think you might be overheating in the act. i suggest you purchase a fan and use that when you go to bed.â  paddy, being a careful sort, doesnât want to splash out on a new fan so he rings his best pal tommy and asks tommy if heâll flap a towel over paddy and mary as they make love. Â that evening tommy comes round and waves a towel over the couple as they go at it. two hours later, thereâs still no difference, mary is still unsatisfied.  âpaddy, i tell you what,â suggests mary, âwhy donât you swap places with tommy? you can flap the towel and tommy and i can try the love making.â  desperate, paddy agrees. within 5 minutes of mary and tommy making vigorous love mary reaches a thunderous climax, and then again. and then again. finally after an hour they both collapse on the bed, exhausted.â  âthat, tommyâ, paddy announces, âis how you flap a bloody towel!â	1

"a soap factory had a problem.  they sometimes shipped empty boxes without the bar inside. this challenged their perceived quality with the buyers and distributors. understanding how important these relationships were, the ceo of the company assembled his top people. they decided to hire an external engineering company to solve their empty boxes problem. six months, and $8 million later, they had a fantastic solution - on time, on budget, and high quality. everyone in the project was pleased.  they solved the problem by using a high-tech precision scale that would sound a bell and flash lights whenever a soap box weighed less than it should. the line would stop, someone would walk over, remove the defective box, and then press another button to re-start the line. as a result of the new package monitoring process, no empty boxes were being shipped out of the factory.  a while later, the ceo decides to look at the first week report. since the scales were put in place, no empty boxes had been shipped out of the factory. each day about a dozen defective boxes were being removed, which was consistent with the projections. there were almost zero customer complaints and they were gaining market share. the ceo felt the $8 million was well spent.   however, the number of defective boxes picked up by the scales dropped to zero after three weeks. he filed a bug against it and after some investigation, the engineers came back saying the report was actually correct. the scales really weren't picking up any defects because all boxes that got to that point in the conveyor belt were good.  puzzled, the ceo traveled down to the factory, viewed the part of the line where the precision scale was installed, and observed just ahead of the new $8 million dollar solution sat a $20 desk fan blowing the empty boxes off the belt and into a bin. he asked the line supervisor what that was about.  ""oh, that,"" the supervisor replied, ""bert, the kid from maintenance, put it there because he was tired of walking over, removing the box and re-starting the line every time the bell rang."""	1

"a pastor is headed to pittsburgh a pastor is headed to pittsburgh for a convention with his associate preacher and they decide to take the train.   at the station, the pastor tells his associate to have a seat while he purchases their tickets.   after standing in line at the ticket counter for an extended period of time, he's finally next in line to purchase the tickets for himself and his associate preacher when he's greeted by an absolute bombshell of a woman working at the ticket counter.   being a man of god, he tried to avert his gaze from the stunning sight of her voluptuous bosom busting through her bright red, low cut top, only to be stunned again by her beautiful long brown hair, bright green eyes, and lipstick that reminded him of the low cut top which was barely containing her busty chest.  trying not to linger too long he attempts to regain his composure, but to no avail as his eyes drift back towards her cleavage as he mumbles, ""i'll take two pickets to tittspurgh, please.""   as soon as the words left his mouth he realized how grievous error and fervently apologized, thoroughly flustered.  the gorgeous woman blushed and assured him that all was forgiven as the pastor quickly strode back to his associate and sat down, utterly embarrassed by the whole ordeal.  a moment later, a stranger sat down next to him and introduced himself as the man who has been behind him in line, and had witnessed the whole thing.  ""don't worry father,"" the man chimed, ""everyone misspeaks every now and again. it's nothing to be so embarrassed about. even just this morning i had a similar incident with my wife.""  looking a little less ashamed after hearing the stranger's kind words of encouragement, the pastor asks, ""well, tell me my son, what happened with your wife this morning?""  ""it was the darnedest thing,"" the stranger said, ""we sat down with our two boys to have breakfast this morning, and what i meant to say was, 'honey, could you please pass the strawberry jam?' but what actually came out of my mouth was, 'you dirty bitch! you've ruined my life!'""

""see that town over there?"" said the first ghost proudly while pointing to several dots of lights in the horizon. the other two ghosts nodded. ""i killed all 500 people in that town, all within an hour.""  the second ghost, unfazed, flew off speedily into the night towards a larger patch of lights in the horizon, returning just 1 minute later. the second ghost was fully covered in red, thick blood dripping off his the now blunt edge of his knife.  ""see that city over there?"" said the second ghost with a wide grin while pointing towards the patch of lights that he returned from. the other two ghosts nodded. ""i killed all 5000 people in that city, all within a minute.""  without hesitation, the third ghost scanned the horizon and found a huge sprawl of bright lights in the distance illuminating the night sky. he then flew towards it, fast as light. the third ghost returned just 1 second later, his cloak completely soaked in blood, so wet it dripped blood on the ground. the blade of his knife was gone.  ""see that lamp post over there?"" said the third ghost without any pride in his tone. the other two ghosts nodded.   ""good, cause i didn't."""	1

the fbi had an open position for an assassin after  all the background checks, interviews and testing were completed, they  had narrowed the field down to 3 possible agents. for the final test,  the fbi agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a  gun. 'we must know that you will follow your instructions no matter  what the circumstances.'  inside  the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair... we need you to  kill her' the man said, 'you can't be serious. i could never shoot my  wife.' the agent said, 'then you're not the right man for this job. take  your wife and go home.'  the  second man was given the same instructions. he took the gun and went  into the room. all was quiet for about 5 minutes. the man came out with  tears in his eyes, 'i tried, but i can't kill my wife.' the agent said,  'you don't have what it takes. take your wife home.'  finally,  the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. he took  the gun and went into the room. shots were heard, one after another.  they heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. after a few  minutes, all was quiet. the door opened slowly and there stood the man,  wiping the sweat from his brow. 'some idiot loaded the gun with blanks'  he said. 'i had to strangle that bitch to death'.	1
