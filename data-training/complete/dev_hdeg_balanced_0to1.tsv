"noah's ark 2.0    in the year 2016, the lord came unto noah, who was now living in america and said:   ""once again, the earth has become wicked and over-populated, and i see the end of all flesh before me.""   ""build another ark and save 2 of every living thing along with a few good humans.""  he gave noah the blueprints, saying:   ""you have 6 months to build the ark before i will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.""  six months later, the lord looked down and saw noah weeping in his yard - but no ark.""noah!,"" he roared, ""i'm about to start the rain! where is the ark?""  ""forgive me, lord,"" begged noah, ""but things have changed.""   ""i needed a building permit.""   ""i've been arguing with the boat inspector about the need for a sprinkler system.""  ""my homeowners association claim that i've violated the   neighborhood by-laws by building the ark in my back yard and exceeding the height limitations. we had to go to the local planning committee for a decision.""  ""then the city council and the electricity company demanded a shed load of money for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the passage for the ark's move to the sea. i told them that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear none of it.""  ""getting the wood was another problem. there's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the greater spotted barn owl.""   ""i tried to convince the environmentalists that i needed the wood to save the owls - but no go!""  ""when i started gathering the animals, peta took me to court. they insisted that i was confining wild animals against their will. they argued the accommodations were too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space.""  ""then the environmental protection agency ruled that i couldn't build the ark until they'd conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood.""  ""i'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the human rights commission on how many minorities i'm supposed to hire for my building crew.""  ""the immigration dept. is checking the visa status of most of the people who want to work.""   ""the labor unions say i can't use my sons. they insist i have to hire only union workers with ark-building experience.""  ""to make matters worse, the irs seized all my assets, claiming i'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species.""   ""so, forgive me, lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark.""  ""suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine and a rainbow stretched across the sky.""  noah looked up in wonder and asked, ""you mean you're not going to destroy the world?""  ""no,"" said the lord. "" the government beat me to it."""	1

""i have a million dollars in your bank,"" the shoeshine says, ""and i'm considering investing some of the money in the capital market.""   ""what your name? â""asks the director.  ""john smith.""  the director arrives at the bank and asks the manager of the customer department:   ""do we have a client named john smith?""  ""certainly â""answers the customer service managerâ, ""he is a highly esteemed customer. he has a million dollars in his account.""  the director comes out, approaches the shoeshine, and says:  ""mr. smith, i ask you this coming monday to be the guest of honor at our board meeting and tell us the story of your life. i am sure we will have something to learn from you.""  at the board meeting, the executive director introduces him to the board members:  ""we all know mr. smith, who makes our shoes shine in the corner; but mr. smith is also our esteemed customer with a million dollars in his account. i invited him to tell us the story of his life. i am sure we can learn from him.""  mr. smith began his story:  ""i came to this country fifty years ago as a young immigrant from europe with an unpronounceable name. i got off the ship without a penny. the first thing i did was change my name to smith. i was hungry and exhausted. i started wandering around looking for a job but to no avail. suddenly i found a coin on the sidewalk. i bought an apple. i had two options: eat the apple and quench my hunger or start a business. i sold the apple for two dollars and bought two apples with the money. i also sold them and continued in business. when i started accumulating dollars, i was able to buy a set of used brushes and shoe polish and started polishing shoes. i didn't spend a penny on entertainment or clothing, i just bought bread and some cheese to survive. i saved penny by penny and after a while, i bought a new set of shoe brushes and ointments in different shades and expanded my clientele. i lived like a monk and saved penny by penny. after a while i was able to buy an armchair so that my clients could sit comfortably while cleaning their shoes, and that brought me more clients. i did not spend a penny on the joys of life. i kept saving every penny. a few years ago, when the previous shoe shine on the corner decided to retire, i had already saved enough money to buy his shoeshine location at this great place.  finally, three months ago, my sister, who was a whore in chicago, passed away and left me a million dollars."""	1

a young engaged couple were very much lookimg forward to their marriage. one sunday afternoon they went out for a drive in the country, and had a terrible head-on collision with a heavy truck.  suddenly they found themselves unexpectedly at heavenâs gates, to the surprise of st peter also. âhow come you two are here?â he asked, âyou werenât due here for another fifty years?â  they explained what they thought had happened, the horror of the oncoming truck on the wrong side of the road. they had been so looking forward to their wedding, to their new home and to married life together. âwould it still be possible,â they asked, âfor us still to get married in heaven?â  st peter was stumped. âmarriage is usually âtill death us do partâ, he explained. once couples arrive here, they usually donât want to remain married, but just good friends. there isnât really marriage in heaven.â  âbut we were so looking forward to married life together. can we not have that opportunity?â they asked.  âwell,â said st peter, âiâll have to go and ask the boss and then find you a priest to perform your wedding. can you just wait around a bit until i come back?â  so they hung around waiting. an hour went past. another hour, several hours. no sign of peter. other saints came to see to the queues forming and check in those qualifying. but no peter. in earth time a day, then a week went past, finally, after the terrestrial equivalent of a month st peter returned. âgood news!â he said, âiâve got permission and itâs all arranged for you!â  but the young couple had been reconsidering. marriage on earth is usually for 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, at a limit 70 years. to actually remain married for all eternity might be just too long. they might tire of each other. so they both explained this to st peter and then asked him:  âif we do get married, would it also be possible to get divorced in heaven?â  âlook here,â said peter, by now exasperated, âitâs taken me a month to find a priest in heaven. how the blazes do you think iâm ever going to find a lawyer?  ï¿¼	1

""i've never broken wind in public in my whole life!"" just then, she tripped, fell off the scales and broke wind.  stunned, she sat back down and looked at the machine. she said to herself, ""this is truly unbelievable! i've got to try it one more time.""  she went back to the machine, put her nickel in and collected the card. it said, ""you're a nun, you weigh 128 lbs., you have fiddled and farted around and missed your flight to chicago!!!"""	1

"there was this guy working at mcdonaldâs. and it was his turn to cook the french fries. so he put the frozen fries in the metal basket and dipped it in the oil. you see this guy was a veteran chef and used to be able to sense when food was cooked by looking at it's color or by smelling it, he never needed a timer or a meat thermometer or anything to help him, and so he just stared at the fries, looking at its color as it turned from white to yellow, compensating for the fact that the oil was too, yellow.   everyone was usually in awe of him because his fries were always yellow crispy perfect. and many customers came flocking to this particular mcdonalds just for his fries.  however today, out of the corner of his eyes , he spied the newest happy meal toy, the talking electric pikachu, licensed by nintendo . as an avid pokemon fan he couldn't help but pick up the toy and pull down on the tail marked with the 'down' arrow.   'pikachu!' it went.   delighted, he pulled on the lightning bolt shaped tail again...  'pikapikapi!'   absolutely thrilled he was at the possible variations of voice recordings the little rodent could provide, he pulled at the tail another thirty more times. âpika?' it went, 'pikachuuuuuu!' and so on until he counted that there were fifteen in all.  suddenly, he received a tap on his shoulder. he turned, only to face his supervisor holding a metal basket full of blackened fries.  ""no human is infallible, as much experience as you have in the culinary arts, you must never be so complacent nor arrogant in your abilities, there are tools of this trade that you can make use of which will help you perform effectively! you have neglected one of the fundamental precepts of our trade! i do not wish to have to say it, or i would be doubly disappointed in you! you do know what i am speaking of do you not?""   the chef hung his head low, and ashamedly remained quiet, pondering over his obvious mistake, one that he had never imagined he would ever make.   ""tell me!!!"" demanded his supervisor...  the kitchen grew quiet as the crew stopped their activities, turning to both of them, just to hear the age old adage :  ""time fries when you're having fun."""	1

so a politician dies... and ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. saint peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.  âso, youâre a politician...â âwell, yes, is that a problem?â âoh no, no problem. but we have recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in hell. after that however, youâre free to choose where you want to spend eternity!â   âwait, i have to spend a day in hell??â says the politician. âthemâs the rulesâ says st peter, clicks his fingers, and woomph, the guy dissapears...  and awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing heâs in hell. cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... nothing. just the smell of, is that fabric softener? and cut grass, this canât eb right?  âopen your eyes!â says a voice. âcâmon, wakey wakey, we have only got 24 hours!â. nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees heâs in a hotel room. a nice one too. wait, this is a penthouse suite... and thereâs a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. âwho are you??â the politician asks. âwell, iâm satan!â says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. âwelcome to hell!â âwait, this is hell? but... whereâs all the pain and suffering?â he asks. satan throws him a wink. âoh, we have been a bit mis-represented over the years, itâs a long story. anyway, this is your room! the minibar is of course free, as is the room service, thereâs extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. but enough of this! itâs a beautiful day, and if youâd care to look outside...â slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. âitâs one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and thereâs another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!â says satan, answering his unasked question. so they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. and as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people heâs admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work heâs admired but died long before his career started. and out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. he spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the tme of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with marylin monroe). as everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... and they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. after 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...  and is woken up  by st peter. âso, that was hell. wasnât what you were expecting, i bet?â âno sir!â says the man. âso thenâ says st peter âyou can make your choice. itâs hell, which you saw, or heaven, which has choral singing, talking to god, white robes, and so onâ. âwell... i know this sounds strange, but on balance, i think i would prefer hellâ says the politician. ânot a problem, we totally understand! enjoy!â says st peter, and clicks his fingers again.  the man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. as he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. a sudden bolt of lightning reveals satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. âwhatâs this??â he cries. âwhereâs the hotel?? whereâs my wife??? whereâs the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???â  âahâ, says satan. âyou see, yesterday, we were campaigning. but today, you voted...â	1

how drunk are you? one night a police officer was staking out a particularly rowdy bar for possible dui violations. at closing time, he saw a fellow stumble out of the bar, trip on the curb and try his keys on five different cars before he found his. the man sat in the front seat fumbling around with his keys for several minutes. meanwhile, all the other patrons left the bar and drove off. finally he started his engine and began to pull away. the police officer was waiting for him. as soon as he pulled onto the street, the officer stopped him, read him his rights and administered the breathalyzer test to determine his blood-alcohol content. the results showed a reading of 0.0. the puzzled officer demanded to know how that could be. the driver replied, âtonight iâm the designated decoy.â	1

""oh yeah?"" he starts, ""ok then, it's been a while, gimme a *pussy* flavored apple!""  and the bartender hands him an apple.  the dwarf takes a big, expectant bite from the apple, and immediately spits it out all over the bar.  ""ughyuuk!!"" he cries out, ""this apple tastes like *shit*!""  the bartender swirls his finger in the air and tells him, ""turn it around...""   edit: wow thanks for all the awards! never had a post blow up like this.  tbh i've never seen this one online before, maybe i'm living under a rock. but it's slain in the meatworld and seems new to lots of you, so hell yeah and thanks again!"	1

have you heard about the old man's gambling problem? an old man had a gambling problem not a bad one but a really good one. he was depositing thousands each day.   a few months pass and seeing as the old man had no job was contacted by the irs to discuss his income.  the old man arrives with his lawyer to speak with the irs agent. the agent asks where and how do you deposit all this money?  the old man explains i know how to gamble.  impossible no man can gamble daily and deposit as much as you do  ok let's make a bet. i bet you $500 i can lick my eye.  the agent observes him for a minute and say fine $500.  the old man pops out his glass eye and licks it.  the irs agent in disbelief he just lost $500 said that it wasn't enough proof.  alright fine i bet you $1000 i can bite my other eye with my teeth.  the agent took a minute and made sure there was absolutely know way it was possible and said ok $1000.  the old man pops out his dentures and bites his other eye.   the agent now in total dismay but still wanting to win said that he still wasn't convinced that he couldnt make this much money daily off cheep gimyics like this.   so the old man said you're right here's how i make my real money. i bet you $50000 i can stand on the opposite side of your desk sideways and piss in the can without spilling a drop on your desk.  the agent looked carefully and thought hard measured the desk and the distance and finally agreed $5000 but not a single drop.  the old man stands to one side of the desk and pees all over the place. soiling all the documents on the agents desk and soaking his chair in urine.  the agent begins jumping with joy and celebrating that he just got $5000 from the old man.  meanwhile the man's lawyer was crying.  curious the agent asked what was wrong to which the lawyer responded i bet him $30000 he couldn't piss on your desk and have you be happy about it.....	1

several churches started having problems with squirrels damaging their buildings. the presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation.  after much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they should not interfere with godâs divine will.  at the baptist church, the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistry.  the deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistry and let the squirrels drown themselves.  the squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.  the lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of godâs creatures.  so, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the baptist church.  two weeks later, the squirrels were back when the baptists took down the water-slide.  the episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning.  they sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do.  but the catholic church came up with a more creative strategy!  they baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church.  now they only see them at christmas and easter.  not much was heard from the jewish synagogue.  they took the first squirrel and circumcised him.  they havenât seen a squirrel since.	1

"one of my favorite jokes one day, a woman, pregnant with triplets, had some business to do in the bank. tough luck, 3 minutes into her conversation with an assistant, an armed robber barges into the bank. he was quickly apprehended, but he managed to fire three shots. unfortunately, all of them hit her right in the belly. she was rushed into the nearest hospital and the doctors did what they could. when the woman woke up, they told her that each of the bullets was stuck in each of her babies but they weren't a threat to their lives and it would be more dangerous to try to remove them than to let them be. the woman understood. 12 years later, she's cooking dinner while her daughter comes downstairs crying. she says ""mommy, mommy, i was peeing, and it hurt a lot  and this came out. she shows a bullet she's holding in her hand. the woman says it's all ok and tells her to go play in the garden. 20 minutes later, her second daughter comes downstairs and tells pretty much  the same thing. the woman's reaction is the same - ""it's all okay, go play with your sister in the garden. 10 minutes later her son comes down with a silly look on his face. the woman says -  ""what, did you piss out a bullet too?"" the son says, with an even sillier look on his face - ""no, i was jerking off and i shot our dog"""	1

.357 magnum my friend is a cop and carries a .357 magnum. one night he comes home and gets  undressed for bed where his wife lie waiting for him.  they start making love and just when heâs ready to explode he grabs his .357 puts it under the pillow next to her and pulls the trigger. well sir she tightened right up and he had the best orgasm of his life.   he tells his buddy this and says youâve gotta give it a try.  his buddy says it sounds great, i think i will.   a few days later the cop asks his buddy if he had a chance to try it yet.   his buddy says yeah well i went  home and  took my  .357 out and slipped it under the pillow without her seeing it like you said and we started making love.    just when i was ready to cum i reached under the pillow and pulled the trigger.   and...how was it?  it wasnât anything like you said it would be.   why what happened.   well she bit my cock and shit in my face.	1

""we are both 25, good genie."", the young wife replied.   with a wide grin to his face, the genie said, ""oh? 25 and you two still believe that genie bullshit?"""	1

didn't like shopping there anyway yesterday i was at my local tescoâ store buying a large bag of winalot dog food for my loyal pet and was in the checkout queue when a woman behind me asked if i had a dog.  what did she think i had, an elephant? on impulse i told her that no, i didn't have a dog, i was starting the winalot diet again.   i added that i probably shouldn'ât, because i ended up in hospital last time, but i'd lost 2 stone before i woke up in intensive care with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and ivs in both arms.  i told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with winalot nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. the food is nutritionally complete so it works well and i was going to try it again. (i have to mention here that practically everyone in queue was now enthralled with my story.)  horrified, she asked me if i ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. i told her no, i stepped off the kerb to sniff an irish setter's arse and a car hit me.  i thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard.   i'm now banned from tesco.	1

"a woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, ""i played on my college's golf team. i was pretty good. mind if i join you next week?"" no one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spotâ¦   finally, one man says, ""okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m.""  he figures the early tee-time will discourage her.  the woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.  they roll their eyes, but say, ""okay.""  she's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.  she's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.  they congratulate her and invite her back the next week.  she smiles, and says, ""i'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45.""  the next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.  only this time, she plays left-handed.  the three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.  they're totally amazed.  they can't figure her out.  she's very pleasant and a gracious winner.  they invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.  the third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.  this week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.  the men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.  however, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.  this woman is a riddle no one can figure out.  they have a couple of beers in the clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, ""how do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?""  the lady blushes, and grins. ""when my dad taught me to play golf, i learned that i was ambidextrous."" she replies. ""i like to switch back and forth.""  ""when i got married after college, i discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. from then on, i developed a silly habit. right before i leave in the morning for golf practice, i pull the covers off him. if his willie points to the right, i golf right-handed; if it points to the left, i golf left-handed.""  the guys think this is hysterical.  astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, ""what if it's pointing straight up?""  she says, ""then, i'm fifteen minutes late."""	1

"#871: several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community... if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.  the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.  however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.  on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other.  the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.  the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.  next, the pope waved his finger around his head.  the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.  the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.  the rabbi pulled out an apple.  with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever.  the jews could stay in italy!  later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened.  the pope said, ""first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs. then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us. finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. he bested me at every move and i could not continue!""  meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won.  ""i don't have a clue!!!"" the rabbi said.  ""first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger. then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here.""  ""and then what?"" asked a woman.  ""who knows!!"" said the rabbi. ""he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!"""	1

the horse, the cow, and the chicken[long] so a horse, a cow, and a chicken live on a farm. one day their owner goes on vacation but accidentally leaves the tv on. the animals peek in the window and witness a rock concert on the tv, theyre inspired.  so the horse calls up guitar center, and asks âhey i want to learn the guitar, but thereâs one problem: iâm a horse.â the employee says âno problem come right down weâll teach you everything you need to knowâ and before you know it, heâs jamming out on the guitar. after that the cow calls too and says âhey i want to learn how to play the bass but thereâs a problem: iâm a cowâ to where the employee replies âawesome! we have special bass lessons just for cows this week come on down!â and before you know it the horse and cow are jamming in harmony with their guitar and bass. lastly the chicken calls and asks for drum lessons, to where he is accepted with open arms. they are now all jamming in the barn and having a blast.  a few days later, a record producer coincidentally walks through town and sees the horse, cow, and the chicken making music. he instantly knows he has to make them famous and offers them a deal. now the horse, cow, and chicken are famous, worldwide rockstars making millions of dollars and even moved off the farm to a luxurious estate. with the fortune came fame and life was great.  one day, on the way to tour before boarding the plane, the horse gets a phone call, his mom is sick! the cow and the chicken say âdonât worry weâll go without you, catch up and the tour will continue itâll be fineâ so the horse goes to check on his mother. it turns out it was a false alarm, but the plane crashes and the cow and chicken die.  the horse is devestated, the money power and fame is gone, the music is in the past, and he is back to the barn, but alone without his friends. in agony and desperation after such a long journey, he decides to get a drink. he walks into the bar and the bartender asks:  âwhy the long face?â	1

a scoutmaster and his girlfriend go hiking in the woods... they take a break in a rocky clearing with odd writing. after a while, they get frisky, and decide to play a little game called hide the sausage. they look around for people even though theyâre in the middle of nowhere. it seems all clear and they go for it. little did they know, they were in the middle of an indian burial ground.   as things were getting hot and heavy, the ground begins to rumble, and, soon enough, a demon rises from the ground.  the young couple cowers frozen in fear on the ground. the demon proclaimed that they were fornicating on sacred ground and their souls are now forfeit. they beg for their lives. the demon was in a good mood so he says he will let them go on one condition. the couple says theyâll do anything. the demon says he will give them an impossible challenge. he says if the man can ejaculate any 8 letter word onto a rock and his girlfriend can guess it correctly with absolutely no communication, they can go free.   the man tells the demon his intended word. he then begins trying to jack off, but the demon emerging from the ground and threatening to take your soul is a bit of a turn off. heâs so scared that he struggles to even get hard. however, their lives depend on it. so after a couple minutes, he jizzes a measly little puddle, completely unreadable. the demon laughs and says your souls are now mine. the girlfriend tells him to wait and to let her guess anyways. he concedes but continues on chuckling. the girlfriend guesses correctly, leaving the demon completely flabbergasted. he incredulously asks her how she guessed right. she responds, âa boy scout always comes *prepared*.â  this is oc as far as iâm concerned. i came up with this myself today and i donât think anyone else is insane enough to come up with it too.  edit:changed devil to demon because someone said a devil is a judeo-christian thing and not native indian	1

""can you put me up for the night?""      ""certainly,"" the chinese man said, ""but on one condition. if you so much as lay a finger on my daughter i will inflict upon you the three worst chinese tortures known to man.""      ""ok,"" said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. she was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. she was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. but during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. he was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.      he woke to feel a pressure on his chest. opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, ""chinese torture 1: large rock on chest."" ""well, that's pretty crappy,"" he thought. ""if that's the best the old man can do then i don't have much to worry about."" he picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. as he did so he noticed another note on it that read ""chinese torture 2: rock tied to left testicle."" in a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. as he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, ""chinese torture 3: right testicle tied to bedpost."""	1

making a baby the smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. on the day the proxy father was to arrive, mr. smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, 'well, i'm off now. the man should be here soon.'  half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. 'good morning, ma'am', he said, 'i've come to...'  'oh, no need to explain,' mrs. smith cut in, embarrassed, 'i've been expecting you.'  'have you really?' said the photographer. 'well, that's good. did you know babies are my specialty?'  'well that's what my husband and i had hoped. please come in and have a seat!'  after a moment she asked, blushing, 'well, where do we start?'  'leave everything to me. i usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. and sometimes the living room floor is fun. you can really spread out there.'  'bathtub, living room floor? no wonder it didn't work out for harry and me!'  'well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. but if we try several different positions and i shoot from six or seven angles, i'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'  'my, that's a lot!', gasped mrs. smith.  'ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. i'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but i'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'  'don't i know it,' said mrs. smith quietly.  the photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'this was done on the top of a bus,' he said.  'oh, my god!' mrs. smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.  'and these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'  'she was difficult?' asked mrs. smith.  'yes, i'm afraid so. i finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. people were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look'  'four and five deep?' said mrs. smith, her eyes wide with amazement.  'yes', the photographer replied. 'and for more than three hours, too. the mother was constantly squealing and yelling - i could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached i had to rush my shots. finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, i just had to pack it all in.'  mrs. smith leaned forward. 'do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh....equipment?'  'it's true, ma'am, yes.. well, if you're ready, i'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'  'tripod?'  'oh yes, ma'am. i need to use a tripod to rest my canon on. it's much too big to be held in the hand very long.'  mrs. smith fainted	1

"german, englishman, and irishman so a german, an englishman and an irishman were all in saudi arabia, sharing a smuggled crate of booze when they were arrested by saudi police. the mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in saudi arabia, so they are all sentenced to death!  however, after many months and with the help of very good lawyers, they were able to appeal their sentences down to 20 lashes each of the whip.  as they were preparing for their punishment, the sheikh announced: ""as it is my first wife's birthday today, she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping.""  the german was first in line; after thinking for a bit he said, ""please tie a pillow to my back."" this was done, but after only 10 lashes the whip had shredded the pillow. when the punishment was done the german had to be carried away bleeding and crying in pain.  the englishman was next up. after watching the german in horror he asked, ""please tie two pillows to my back."" this time it took 15 lashes, but once again the pillows were shredded, and the englishman was led away bleeding and whimpering in pain.  the irishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the sheikh turned to him and said: ""you are from the most beautiful part of the world i have ever seen. because of this, you may have two wishes!""  ""thank you, your most royal and merciful highness,"" the irishman replied. ""in recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes.""  ""not only are you an honorable man from a beautiful island, you are also very brave,"" the sheikh said with admiration. ""if 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. and your second wish?""  and the irishman said, ""tie the englishman to my back."""	1

"the girlfriend joke now, i need to caveat the beginning of this joke with some information. i'm a solid six-outta-ten, a real average looking guy. never been too smooth wirth the ladies but whaddaya do, never been lonely neither. so, one day i come home from work, i live in a little apartment complex, and i see across the hall is this nine-outta-ten girl, hauling boxes into her new place. so i, like the curious neighbor i am, walk up and ask ""hey, can i give you a hand with those boxes?"" and inthe snootiest, whitest white girl voice i've ever heard she says ""uhm, no thanks, creep!"" so i walk off, defeated and dejected, and settle in for a night of video games, good pizza and generally a snazzy ol' time. the next morning, as i'm walking out of my house and locking the door, i hear a much calmer version of the same white girl voice i heard just before, and to protect her identity, i'm just gonna call her nine.  nine says to me, ""i'm so sorry for the way i treated you last night, moving into a new place is so stressful i took it out on you and i shouldn't have done that."" ""not a problem, sometimes it be like that,"" i respond. ""can i take you out for dinner tonight as an apology?"" she's starting to get really flirty at this point. score! ""on one condition, you let me pay, and i take you to a movie as well."" i'm in the clear now!   so nine and i date for a few weeks and it's going awesomely, she's super hot, she's really sweet and we get busy doing all sorts of stuff you do in the secrecy of your own home with the person you love. like our taxes.   and then, not too long later, and new girl moves in, one door opposite me. a decent seven-outta-ten, not super hot like nine, but still cute. so i see her moving boxes the same way and offer to help, and she gladly accepts. she directs me to bring a loosely-taped, very old worn-down looking box to the living room, and so i do. i plop the box - carefully - onto the floor, and notice it's full of old 90's era video games, complete woth a snes and a nes, really cool stuff, basically. so i casually ask her ""is that your boyfriends'box of games"", and she cheerily tells me no. she's an avid gamer, and a major collector of 90's nostalgia. primo cool stuff, and we form a fast friendship.  so life is great for a few months, nines and i spend tons of time together, madly in love, and seven is my new best friend. until, one day, nines tells me that she's starting to become really jealous of seven, which, to be fair, is entirely understandable. if i'm not with one i'm with the other, and i can see how she might think something is going on. so i tell her to spend some time with seven, if she likes me, she'll love seven, and hopefully they can become fast friends too.  then it gets weird, nines tells me that while they were hanging out, seven threatened to kill her, if she didn't stop seeing me. and nines is fucking scared man, like, she thinks seven might actually do something about it. but it's late, so i tell her i'll talk to seven in the morning.  morning comes, i knock on seven's door. no answer. text seven, no answer. call her, no answer. nine's door. text. call. nothing.  so i think maybe they're at work already - or run off to start their own secret romance?  i come home from work, haven't heard from either of them. i'm ghosted for weeks.  and then, i see her. seven, on the news. covered in blood. she looks straight into the camera. ""she's dead, you're next."" cut to a shot of an anchorman, talking about how a woman was murdered. bites taken out of her flesh.  she's dead, you're next.  they autopsy the body, murder. it was nines. parts of her had been eaten.  she's dead, you're next.  nines is dead. i'm next.  so it begs the question, why was six afraid of seven? because seven ate nine."	1

""we must know that you will follow your instructions, no matter what the circumstances. inside this room you will find your wife sitting in a chair. you have to kill her.""  the first man said. ""you canât be serious. i could never shoot my wife.""  the agent replies, ""then youâre not the right man for this job.""  the second man was given the same instructions. he took the gun and went into the room. all was quiet for about five minutes. then the agent came out with tears in his eyes. ""i tried, but i canât kill my wife!"" the agent replies ""you donât have what it takes. take your wife and go home.""  finally, it was the womanâs turn. only she was told to kill her husband.  she took the gun and went into the room. shots were heard, one shot after another. they heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. after a few minutes, all was quiet. the door opened slowly and there stood the woman. she wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""you guys didnât tell me the gun was loaded with blanks. so i had to beat him to death with the chair!"""	1

"fiat vs ferrari so on a nice and sunny sunday afternoon jim is taking his laferrari for a spin on the highway. driving along for a while when jim spots a broken down car on the side of the road, apparently having some issues. as jim is passing he realizes the car is a old fiat 500.   chuckling to himself about the state of the car jim decides to pull over and lend this poor bloke a hand. after enquiring where the problem is jim offers to tow the guy to the next workshop which the fiat drivers graciously accepts.  so after talking things through with the driver, jim suggests the other guy get into his fiat.  before starting tho they agree that in case jim is speeding the driver in the fiat should honk his horn and flash his lights so jim would know when things are moving to fast for the fiat driver. after all the fiat driver is not used to the neckbreaking speeds a ferrari laferrari is capable off.   once they got back on the 2 lane highway jim was driving on the right line with a moderate speed as suddenly:""wroooom!!"". a bright yellow lamborghini blitzes past them while looking straight at jim and poking fun at him. jim, obviously, wasn't having none of that cocky shit and hits the pedal to the metal as he begins rushing after the lamborghini driver. after a while jim catches up and the two of them go on to race their cars to the maximum. forcing their cars engines to the absolute brink as they race each other head to head.  they go on like that for a while until they pass a police trooper on speed control duty. the officer witnessing the race just feints and drops on his back. in shock his colleague ran over to check on him. after a bit the officer regains his conscience and his partner asks him wtf happened? officer:"" dude i've just seen a ferrari and a lamborghini speeding. they have booth been doing over 200 m/ph.!!"". ""well..."" the other officer sighs.. ""that's still no reason to pass out tho""? ""well you haven't seen the fiat 500 behind the two, honking his horn and trying to get into the lead...""  p. s: if you've made it this far.. hope you've enjoyed the joke albeit it's a long one! and also apologies for my bad english(not my first language) and also apologize for any spelling/formatting mistakes... was typing this up on mobile!"	1

"a deaf-mute guy goes into a pharmacy to buy some condoms after looking around the shop for a while and being unable to spot what he wants, he goes up to the counter and signs to the pharmacist, who only looks at him in mild bewilderment. the deaf-mute pats his pockets for a pencil and paper only to realize that he's come out without any, and he resorts to increasingly basic sign language with no success. eventually, in exasperation, he has a quick look around to make sure no-one's coming into the shop, places a $5 bill on the counter, unzips, and slaps his dick down next to it. the pharmacist shrugs, puts down $5 of his own, unzips, slaps down a rather larger dick and then picks up the money.  as the deaf-mute begins to jump up and down and shake his fist, the pharmacist just shrugs: ""fella, if you're gonna get sore when you lose, you didn't oughtta bet!""."	1

""no!"" trump said. ""i don't think so. i'm not a good swimmer and i don't think i could do that all day long.""    the devil led him to the next room. in it was tony blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. all he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.  ""no! i've got this problem with my shoulder. i would be in constant agony if all i could do was break rocks all day!"" commented trump.     the devil opened a third door. in it, trump saw bill clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. bent over him was monica lewinsky, doing what she does best.    trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, ""yeah, i can handle this.""    the devil smiled and said, ""monica, you're free to go!"""	1

"news from school dear mom and dad,        it has been three months now since i left for college. i have been remiss in writing and i am very sorry for my thoughtlessness in not writing before. i will bring you up to date now, but before you read on, please sit down. you are not to read further unless you are sitting down, okay?         well, then, i'm getting along pretty well now. the skull fracture and the concussion i got when i jumped out of the window of my dormitory when it caught fire shortly after my arrival here is pretty well healed. i only spent two weeks in the hospital and now i can see almost normally and only get those sick headaches once a day.         fortunately, the fire in the dormitory and my jump was witnessed by an attendant at the gas station near the dorm, and he was the one who called the fire department and the ambulance. he also visited me in the hospital and since i have nowhere to live because of the burnt-out dormitory, he was kind enough to invite me to share his apartment.   it's really a basement room, and it's kind of cute.      he is a very fine boy and we have fallen deeply in love and are planning to get married. we haven't set the exact date yet, but it will be before my pregnancy  begins to show. i know how much you are looking forward to being  grandparents, and i know you will welcome the baby and give it the  same love and devotion and tender care you gave me when i was a child.        the reason for the delay in our marriage is that my boyfriend has a minor infection that prevents us from passing our premarital blood tests and i carelessly caught it from him. i have bumps all over my ""down there"" but this will soon clear up with the penicillin injections i am taking daily. i know that you will welcome him into our family with open arms. he is kind and although not well educated, he is ambitious. although he is of a different race, color and religion than ours, i know your often-expressed tolerance will not permit you to be bothered by this fact.         now that i have brought you up to date, i want to tell you that there was no dormitory fire. i did not have a concussion or a skull fracture. i was not in the hospital. i am not pregnant. i am not  engaged.  i do not have a disease and there is no miscegenation in my life. however, i am getting a ""d"" in history and an ""f"" in science, and i wanted you to see those marks in the proper perspective.    your loving daughter, xxx"	1

""i want the spiciest curry in all of korea"" and the guards complied and gave the man the spiciest curry he'd ever eaten, even spicier than the last.  the man was then sat down in the chair and the switch was pulled. again sparks flew and smoke filled the room, but again the man was completely fine!  ""alright,"" says the supreme leader, ""i will give you 1 last chance to impress me"" and the man went back to work. for a third time he assembled the best orchestra in all of korea and went to perform in front of the leader.  but once again it was horrible, so bad in fact that kim had to cover his ears to block it out. so once again the man was ordered to be put to death.  ""very well,"" said the man, ""for my final meal i wish for the spiciest curry in the entire world.""  ""no,"" said the supreme leader, ""i have had it with your magical curry, you will be put straight to death."" and so the man was strapped into the chair and this time the switch was pulled by none other than the supreme leader himself.  sparks flew and smoke filled the room but the man still remained untouched! ""what?!?!"" exclaimed the leader. ""but how, you didn't eat any curry.""  ""oh no no no sir, it was never about the curry,"" said the man,  ""i'm just a poor conductor."""	1

""why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?"" his wife said.  so the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *my daughter is inviting all of her friends, and i'll look bad if i don't put together a good cake*, he thought. then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.  *how quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  he was met by a buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  ""hello,"" the father asked, ""i would like to buy a cake.""  ""of course,"" the monk replied, ""just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk.""  the father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  the day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. all of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  the monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  ""why do you do this for free? you should take money for your services!""  the monk smiled and said, ""i do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."""	1

a deaf and mute orphan in a small village... ...is found pregnant. the villagers cannot find any way to get the poor girl to help them find out what happened. as the girl is due to give birth, a nasty rumor begins to circulate among the folk: the preacher is to blame.  the preacher does not expect the villagers to care much for the vile slander, but soon the rumor gains serious tract, and the poor man finds himself unable to wash this stain off his collar. he does all he can for the girl and the baby, even arranging shelter in a nearby convent, but everything he does only serves to stoke the fires of gossip. he spends his last twenty years in utter despair, begging and praying for god to help him clear his name, and passes away in pain and with a broken heart, unmourned.   he is brought to the pearly gates. st. peter informs him that, as a faithful man of cloth, he is free to request an audience with god anytime he wishes. he wastes no time. after a warm welcome, he gets straight to the point:  -dear lord! i have spent my entire life serving you. walked the path of righteousness. did my best to spread your holy word. yet you deemed it fit for me live with shame for twenty years because of a vile deed i would never commit! why? why did you not help me clear my name? why did you let me die in sorrow?  god leans over the man and puts his hand over his shoulder:  -boy, what makes you think i could help? those motherfuckers did the same to me with that jesus kid, and i haven't been able to clean my *own* name in over two thousand years!	1

""thereâs nothing that could help get us out of poverty now,"" says the dad as he shoots himself.  the mom walks outside and sees the dad and the chickens on the ground.  ""i can't live without my husband,"" she says as she shoots herself with her husband's gun.  the daughter walks outside and sees her mother, father, and the dead chickens.  ""i can't live any longer without my family,"" she says as she jumps into the river and kills herself.  the oldest son, 23 years old, walks outside looking for the family and sees them all dead.  ""is there anyway to bring them back,"" he yells at the sky.  poof! a magical fairy appears out of thin air.  ""i will bring your whole family back to life, even the chickens,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. if not, i get to kill you.""  the boy fucks her 2 times in a row and he dies.  the middle son, 19 years old, comes out and sees the fairy. she gives him the same offer as his brother.  ""i will bring your whole family back to life, even the chickens,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. if not, i get to kill you.""  the son agrees to do it but can only do it 4 times. he dies.  the youngest son, 15 years old, comes out and is given the same offer.  ""i will bring your whole family back to life, even the chickens,"" she says, ""if you can fuck me 5 times in a row. if not i get to kill you.""  the son says, ""what if i fuck you 10 times in a row?""  the fairy thinks. she says, ""i will bring back your family and grant you fortune.  the son says, ""what if i fuck you 20 times in a row?""  she thinks again and says, ""i will bring back your family, grant you fortune, and give you a mansion.""  the son thinks and says, ""what if i fuck you 30 times in a row?""  she thinks and says, ""i will bring back your family and ensure that your family bloodline remains rich for the next generations to come.""  the son says, ""wait, how do i know youâll survive it?""  ""what do you mean?"" says the fairy.  ""the chickens didn't."""	1

story with a moral young king arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. the monarch could have killed him but was moved by arthur's youth and ideals. so, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death.  the question?... what do women really want? such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young arthur, it seemed an impossible query. but, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end.  he returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. he spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer.  many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer.  but the price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.  the last day of the year arrived and arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. she agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first .  the old witch wanted to marry sir lancelot, the most noble of the knights of the round table and arthur's closest friend!  young arthur was horrified. she was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. he had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life.  he refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden; but lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with arthur.  he said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to arthur's life and the preservation of the round table.  hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered arthur's question thus:   what a woman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life.  everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that arthur's life would be spared.  and so it was, the neighboring monarch granted arthur his freedom and lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding.  the honeymoon hour approached and lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. but, what a sight awaited him. the most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. the astounded lancelot asked what had happened .  the beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half. which would he prefer? beautiful during the day... or night?  lancelot pondered the predicament. during the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch ? or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments?  what would you do?  what lancelot chose is below. but... make your choice before you scroll down below. okay?   noble lancelot said that he would allow her to make the choice herself.  upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life.  now...what is the moral to this story?  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  the moral is:  if you don't let a woman have her own way,  things are going to get ugly...	1

"a grumpy old man and his wife . . . while on a road trip, an elderly couple stopped at a roadside restaurant for lunch.  after finishing their meal, they left the restaurant, and resumed their trip.  when leaving, the elderly woman unknowingly left her glasses on the table, and she didn't miss them until they had been driving for about forty minutes.  by then, to add to the aggravation, they had to travel quite a distance before they could find a place to turnaround, in order to return to the restaurant to retrieve her glasses.  all the way back, the elderly husband became the classic grumpy old man.  he fussed and complained, and scolded his wife relentlessly during the entire return drive.  the more he chided her, the more agitated he became.  he just wouldn't let up for a single minute.  to her relief, they finally arrived at the restaurant.  as the woman got out of the car, and hurried inside to retrieve her glasses, the old geezer yelled to her, ""while you're in there, you might as well get my hat and the credit card."""	1

""dear woodpecker,"" said the birch tree, ""kindly fly down and examine that sapling! then you can tell us if it is a son of a birch or a son of a beech!""  ""certainly i will,"" replied the woodpecker, and he flew down and gave the sapling a firm peck.   ""well?"" asked the beech tree, ""is that sapling a son of a birch or is it a son of a beech?""  ""this sapling isn't a son of a birch, nor is it a son of a beech!"" said the woodpecker. ""this, my friends, is the finest piece of ash i've ever put my pecker into!"""	1

"a man walks into a bar and orders a screwdriver, so the bartender hands him an apple confused, the man says ""bartender, i would like the drink."" the bar tender shakes his head no and says ""just eat the apple.""  the man takes a bite out of the apple and to his surprise he says ""wow, this tastes like vodka!"" and the bartender says ""turn it around."" so the man turns the apple around and takes another bite and says ""this side tastes like orange juice!"" and he walks away eating the rest of the apple.  a few minutes later he asks the bartender for another drink. ""i would like a mimosa"" he says. the bartender reaches under the bar and hands the man another apple. tired of apples, the man asks for the drink again and the bartender refuses and tells him to just eat the apple. he takes a bit and again to his surprise the apple tastes like champagne. ""wow this is a cool trick!"". the bartender again tells the man to ""turn it around."" the man turns the apple around takes another bit and again it's orange juice!  a few minutes go by and the man approaches the bar heavy in thought. he says to the bartender ""you know, if we can make these apples taste like pussy we could be rich!"". the bartender reaches under the bar and hands the man another apple. ""no way!"" says the man as he mouth-wateringly takes a huge bite out of the apple. almost immediately he spits apple chunks everywhere and on the verge of vomiting he yells at the bartender ""this apple tastes like shit!"" and so the bartender said ""turn it around."""	1

a farmer named paddy had a car accident. he was hit by a truck owned by the eversweet company. in court, the eversweet company's hot-shot solicitor was questioning paddy. 'didn't you say to the police at the scene of the accident, 'i'm fine?' asked the solicitor. paddy responded: 'well, i'll tell you what happened. i'd just loaded my fav'rit cow, bessie, into da... '    'i didn't ask for any details', the solicitor interrupted. 'just answer the question. did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'i'm fine!'?'    paddy said, 'well, i'd just got bessie into da trailer and i was drivin' down da road.... '    the solicitor interrupted again and said,'your honour, i am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the police on the scene that he was fine. now several weeks after the accident, he is trying to sue my client. i believe he is a fraud. please tell him to simply answer the question. '    by this time, the judge was fairly interested in paddy's answer and said to the solicitor: 'i'd like to hear what he has to say about his favourite cow, bessie'.    paddy thanked the judge and proceeded.'well as i was saying, i had just loaded bessie, my fav'rit cow, into de trailer and was drivin' her down de road when this huge eversweet truck and trailer came tundering tru a stop sign and hit me trailer right in da side. i was trown into one ditch and bessie was trown into da udder. by jaysus i was hurt, very bad like, and didn't want to move. however, i could hear old bessie moanin' and groanin'. i knew she was in terrible pain just by her groans.    shortly after da accident, a policeman on a motorbike turned up. he could hear bessie moanin' and groanin' too, so he went over to her. after he looked at her, and saw her condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes.    den da policeman came across de road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, 'how are you feelin'?'    'now wot da fock would you say?'	1
my great-grandma told me this joke as a kid and it is by far my favorite kid-friendly joke of all time (iâm also aware of just how corny it is and i donât care) there was a country called raberia, and all the people there were called rabbis. there was this one rabbi who wanted to go mountain climbing in this other country called trideria, and all the people there were called trids. so he hired two trids to take him up the mountain and away they go. after a few hours they get tired and come to a ledge with a cave and decide to set up camp.  all of the sudden, a giant snow monster comes out screaming and kicks the two trids off the mountain. the rabbi gets down on his knees and begs âplease mister monster! please donât kick me off the mountain!â  the monster looks at him calmly and replies âsilly rabbi, kicks are for trids!â	1

""he says he's been to detroit, and liked it.""  the patrolman returns to the car after running the plates and decides to let the man off with a warning. but before he lets them go on their way, he says to the man, ""you know, this may seem inappropriate, but i thought this was funny...i once got the worst blowjob of my life in detroit.""    the wife, still trying to keep up, again yells out ""what did he say??!""    the man responds.

"so there was this man in bulgaria who drove trains for a living. he loved his job. driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. he loved to make the train go as fast as possible. unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. he made it out, but a single person died. well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. he was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. when the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. after eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. the man was perfectly fine.    well, at the time, there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. the trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. for his final meal, the man requested two bananas. after eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.    well, this of course meant that he was free to go. and once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. to what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. on the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.    ""you know what? no,"" said the executioner. ""i've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. i'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. the switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. the executioner was speechless.   the man looked at the executioner and said, ""oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. i'm just a bad conductor."""	1

""i understand my friends. our lord truly does work in mysterious ways. he has provided this miracle - it is clear that he has plans for me yet and does not wish for me to enter his kingdom at this time."" after a long pause, he continued, ""if his will be done, and i am to lay with a woman then i have three requests.""  ""of course - anything you wish. you have only to ask,"" came the reply with a sigh of relief.  ""first,"" said the pope, ""the woman must be blind so that she may not see with whom she lays"".  ""yes, yes, discretion must be maintained"" the cardinals responded nodding.  ""second,"" said the pope, ""the woman must also be deaf so that she may not hear and perhaps guess as to my identity"".  ""brilliant your holiness,"" the cardinals agreed. ""and what, father, is your third request?""  ""big tits"""	1

a wife who was a bit of a nag died suddenly after 25 years of marriage. . . on the day of the funeral the pall bearers were carrying the coffin followed by the grieving husband. they were leaving the church after the service when one of them slipped a bit knocking the coffin into the corner of a wall and jarring it rather suddenly.  a moment after they did so, they began to hear some noise coming from the coffin.  instead of putting it into the hearse and off to the graveyard, they opened it up and to the amazement of all found out the wife was not dead, but had been in a deep coma.  reunited now with her husband, the couple went home and for the next 25 years the wife continued to nag.  she eventually died after 50 years of marriage, and the husband once again found himself in the same church as years before following the coffin containing his wife as it was being carried out by pall bearers.  as they approached the exit, he yelled out, âoh, oh, be careful not to hit that wall!â	1

this one is mine, so it's not great, but i like it.... a guy named bob works in an oil refinery, and since he only lives about a mile from the plant, he just rides his bicycle in every day. there only inconvenience is he has to carry his bike across a catwalk that stretches over numerous vats of oil being refined.   one day, he stumbles and *gloop* the bike falls into one of the vats. bob runs back down the stairs before his bike sinks too far, pulls it out, and heads back up to the catwalk. the bike is lightweight, but after carrying it already his hand runs out of strength and *sploot* in it goes again.   once more, he retrieves his bicycle and is making his way across, feels his grip failing on the slippery frame and then (you guessed it) *splop* back into the oil.   it was a viscous cycle.	1

porn is closer to a realistic representation of sex than influencers are at a realistic representarion of their own lives. we all understand that a large portion of pornography isn't in any way an true representation of what happens in sex. we can also say the same thing about influencers daily lives on instagram is not a realistic representation of what life they are actually living.  i wonder why then that pornography is held in lower disregard then instagram influencing is to the general public? surely exaggerating one aspect of life is less damaging then exaggerating some, if not all, aspects of life?  edit: i understand this is contraversial but i was hoping discuss it and of course, yes, there are always going to be broad generalisations with broad statements like this. not all influencers are faking it. same with some pornography. my question is one is obviously less frowned upon then the other and yet both are not good representations of what happens in the real world. should they not be measured with the same tape?  i will add that i also get that porn can have a very dark underbelly which will inevitably influence social stigma. but if a person decides to do porn of their own volition, vs that same person becoming an instagram influencer, the person in porn is usually more at risk of antagonistic behaviour.	1

a girl and her sniper rifle  i had a friend named sierra once. she was a pretty chill girl. really only had two defining characteristics about her though, her love of lemon-lime sodas and her innate marksmanship. she was a damn good crackshot.     her dad was a bit of a gun nut. owned lots of rifles including a classic, old-time sniper from back in the wwii era. beautiful old thing. she learned to fire it at age 12, could hit targets at 100 meters by age 15. she ended up entering some sharpshooting competition around the area.     this one competition was particularly important to her because it was sponsored by a soda company. the prize was a year's supply of any soda the winner wanted. of course, my friend entered for that delicious lemon-lime goodness. so she hefted her trusty old sniper over to the field.     there were 16 contestants so the competition was a single-elimination bracket. the rules were simple. stand behind the line, aim and fire. if you hit it, the target got pushed back a few meters. if you miss and the other guy hits it, you're out.     well my friend easily blew most of the competitors out of the water. punks couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. she completely cleared out her side of the bracket with almost no competition.     it came down to the final round. she was up against jackson.     at 6 foot 6, this guy was an intimidating foe. even with those catcher's glove-sized hands he still wielded his rifle with the grace of a ballerina. completely wiped out his side of the bracket. it was getting tense.     he fired off first. 50 meters. easy.   her next. 50 meters. easy.   and then him. 100 meters. easy.   her. 100 meters. easy.   150. harder.   200. harder.   300. barely made it.     but it came down to the wire. two bottles, 400 meters down the field. jackson stepped up first, sweat dripping down his face. he fired.     bang.     crack.     the bullet nicked the side, shattering the target. but you could see the jackson's nervousness. it was clear that he would not be able to hit the next target. it was up to sierra now.     she was sweating buckets. it all came down to this. if she could tap that glass even slightly, she'd be looking at a year's supply of her favorite soft drink.     she lined up her shot. stared down the sights. the audience looked on in anticipation. her lemon-lime drinks were on the line. this was all she needed.     bang.     .     .     .     nothing. her soda was gone.     sierra missed.	1

"priest calls a town meeting about rumors of ghosts...

""alright, who here has talked with a ghost?"" half the people there put their hands up. ""who here has touched a ghost?"" five people raise their hands. the priest raises an eyebrow. ""who here has had intercourse with a ghost?"" the whole congregation is shocked that the priest would ask that, but one person in the very back of the church, raises his hand. the priest is shocked, so he calls the man up to the front, and asks again âyou sir have had intercourse with a ghost?â. the man's face turns bright red, and he says softly, ""i'm so sorry, father. i thought you said goat."""	1

"vladimir putin is hosting a summit with donald trump, kim jong-un, and justin trudeau.  as a part of the summit, putin takes the three leaders to a wilderness area outside of moscow and dismisses the press corps, and a large wolf in a cage is brought out.     ""friends, this savage wolf was trapped and brought from the wilds of siberia just yesterday. i want to show you what kind of man i am.""     putin takes a pencil and puts it behind his ear. then he unzips his pants and underwear and stands there butt naked in front of the three world leaders.     ""now, witness the strength of russia.""     he puts his stuff through the bars of the cage, and the wolf starts licking his balls. after a few minutes, the wolf starts to nibble with his teeth.. putin endures it for several seconds, and then when the wolf finally latches on to his penis, he grabs the pencil from behind his ear and pokes the wolf in the eye with the eraser. as the wolf yelps, putin pulls his package out from the cage and gets dressed.     ""and that, gentlemen,"" putin says as the gets over the pain, ""is the strength and power of russia. now, show me what your nations are made of. supreme leader?""     kim jong-un smiles and laughs and says, ""no thank you, mr. president, my, uh... wife would never forgive me.""     putin laughs politely and shrugs his shoulders. he then looks to trudeau. ""mr. trudeau? canada has native wolves, show us the strength of canada!""     the prime minister looks abashed. ""eh... no, no thank you, sir.""     this time putin can't withhold his grin. he finally turns to donald trump.

milking machine a guy visited his farmer friend at his farm. he saw the farmer milking the cows then the guy told him, how the hell you still use your hands for milking the cows!!! there are milking machines out there. it save time, efforts and cleaner. the farmer was convinced and both of them went to the city and bought a brand new milking machine. after usage, the farmer was very happy with the result, all the buckets were being filled up easily, it was faster and more milk productivity.  few weeks later the farmer was alone in the farm and something came to his mind âwhat if i try the milking machine on me!â he attaches the machine to his penis and and got extreme pleasure. after he was done he wanted to turn off the machine but it wouldnât turn off. after another half an hour he got pleasure again and was so tired. also tried to turn off the machine but still it wouldnât turn off. one more hour same thing happened and he was laying on the ground, very tired and couldnât move. he noticed the customer service phone number on the machine so he pulled his mobile and called the them.  a lady answered him. he said âi bought a milking machine few weeks back and i cannot turn it off, please tell me how for the sake of godâ the lady answered him âdonât worry sir the machine will automatically turn off when the bucket is fullâ	1

"i translated this joke from arabic an engineer school graduate opened a clinic. if he were able to solve the patient's problem he would charge Â£1000. however, if he couldn't treat the patient he would give them Â£5000.  the engineer was soon making more money than the real doctor's clinic nearby. the doctor was confused and decided he would go and see how the engineer was making so much money.  the doctor goes into the clinic and claims he has been barely hearing in the past days. the engineer does a couple tests on him and the doctor manages to fake that he can't hear. the doctor was so happy he was about to win a free 5 grand and as the engineer was handing him the money he swears at him under his breath.   he says: ""excuse me?""  the engineer replies: ""wow you heard me. your hearing problem is gone. give me my Â£1000""  the doctor is fuming for falling for a trick like that. he decides to go again this time reporting that he has lost the ability of smelling. the engineer goes into a room and turns on the gas. the doctor recognises the smell and says:  ""are you trying to kill me?!""  the engineer answers him:  ""oh you smelt it. well problem solved give me a Â£1000.  the doctor is now furious and decided he would come prepared the next time and get his money back.  this time, he reports that he has been experiencing blindness lately. the engineer thinks for a couple seconds then goes:  ""i have to say i cannot solve your problem""  the doctor is flattered and is trying to hide his smile. the engineer hands him a Â£5 pound note. the doctor quickly says:  ""hey, you scammer, where's my 5 grand?""  the engineer replies:  ""wow, your blindness has been cured. i want my Â£1000."	1

"i lost my hat one sunday before a church service, a priest notices a man sitting in a pew who he has not seen in years.  the priest approaches and says, ""wow! i can't remember the last time i saw you here! what brings you here today?""  the man replies, ""good morning, father! well you see, ten years ago i lost my hat and i have come to get it back!""  the priest replies, ""ten years? what makes you think it would be here after all that time?""  ""good question father,"" replies the man. ""it's not exactly my hat, but i know that solomon comes here every sunday and he wears the same hat. so i figured that when he goes into confession, i'll just nip on over and take it for myself!""  the priest is a bit disappointed, but leaves the man to his devices.  the service goes on as normal, and afterwards the priest notices that the man is still sitting there with no hat.  ""well,"" says the priest. ""looks like you changed your mind! i'm glad!""  the man replies, ""oh yes, father! you see, i was going to take solomon's hat, but i was listening to your service this morning and it really resonated with me. i especially enjoyed the part about the ten commandments!""  with a bit of smugness, the priest says, ""ah, so you must have liked the part about 'thou shalt not steal'?""  ""not quite, father,"" says the man. ""it was actually the one about 'thou shalt not commit adultery' and i remembered where i left my hat!"""	1

several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community... if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.  the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.  however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.  on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other  the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.  the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.  next, the pope waved his finger around his head. the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.  the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.  the rabbi pulled out an apple.  with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. the jews could stay in italy!  later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened. the pope said, 'first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs.' 'then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us.' 'finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'he bested me at every move and i could not continue!'  meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won. 'i don't have a clue!!!' the rabbi said. 'first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger.' then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here. 'and then what?' asked a woman. 'who knows...' said the rabbi. 'he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!'	1

""hmmm... there must be a bug in the programming"", i thought at first. but pretty soon it dawned on me what had happened:  these shoes had good soles."	1

""there are 3 ducks on that pond."" the men walked down to the pond, and sure as shit, there were 3 ducks on the pond. feeling he was being taken for a fool, one man calls bullshit. ""you must have already been down there, double or nothing, but we'll drive down the road and try again.""   so the men jumped in their trucks, drove down the road, and again sent the dog down to the pond. when the dog came back, he barked 7 times. ""there's 7 ducks on that pond."" again, they walked down to the pond, and again, the dog was right. ""that's incredible. i've got to have that dog. i'll give you $5000 for that dog."" the man thought for a moment, but wasn't willing to part with the dog. ""fine, i'll give you $10,000 if i can take the dog home right now."" $10,000 was a lot of money, so the man decided he could always train another.   &#x200b;  with a smile on his face, the new dog owner drove to neighboring towns gun club and walked in. ""guys, i've got the the most incredible dog. i bet you $1,000 each that my dog can run to the lake, come back and bark for each duck on the pond."" 5 men took the bet, so the man sent his new dog down. after a couple minutes, the dog came back. bewilderingly, the dog didn't just bark, but began shaking a stick and humping the guys leg.  ""ok guys, sorry he's knew, double or nothing he can do it on the next one."" so again he sends the dog down to the pond, and again the dog didn't just bark, but began shaking a stick and humping the guys leg. furious, the man pays off his debt and shoots the dog. he jumps in his truck and speeds back to the first gun club irate.   ""you scum bag, i want my money back. that dog was defective.""   ""why do you say that? you clearly saw what he could do as i sent him down in front of your very eyes.""   ""well i sent him down to the lake, just like you showed me. when he came back, the dog didn't just bark, but began shaking a stick and humping my leg. twice that happened, so i shot the dog and came straight here.""   ""you fucking idiot, he was trying to tell you there are more ducks on the pond than you can shake a fucking stick at."""	1

a mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up so, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  he glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  when he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  he thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.  a few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  he glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  he thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.  the next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  he opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  the mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.  *ding-dong, ding-dong.  ding-dong, ding-dong.  ding-dong, ding-dong.*  the door opens and standing there is a stout buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.  âpardon me, sir,â the mailman says, âbut you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, itâs only going to end up back at your home in a few days.â  âah, my letter.  thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  please do so againâ replies the buddhist monk.  âbut sir,â says mailman, âyou will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.â  âbut that is my intention, dear man,â replies the buddhist monk.  âyou see, reposting is the best way to get karma.â	1

"adam was born in hong kong adam was born in hong kong as the seventh child to the lee family, who were loving parents. adam's parents had moved to hong kong in from a small village in the xinjiang province of china in search of a better life for them and their family.  however, due to a lack of proper education in their village, they struggled to find work and both ended up working as cleaners in a university, earning minimum wage and they struggled day to day to get by. however, they were loving parents, and gave everything they could to their children. adam had a happy childhood, a better education, and loved his mother and father dearly.   the day after completing his final school exams, young adam's world was torn apart.his parents had been killed in a tragic boating accident while they we celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary. this devastated the teenager, he adored his parents and felt he has lost his whole world. he decided to go travelling to get away from the life in hong kong, where every day he was reminded of those he had lost. using his meagre inheritance, he booked a ticket to london and packed a single bag, not looking back.  adam lived the high life, working in hotels and bars, he travelled europe, drinking and partying his sorrows away. after a good six months, he met a girl and settled in amsterdam, which was as good a city for the young man as you can imagine. he was fed up with the lifestyle of hospitality work, and found an ad for a job as apprentice cheese maker, of all things, studying the profession under the tutelage of franciscus veltman, a cheese maker world renowned, his edam especially was constantly voted the best in all of the netherlands. as such they technique and recipe was a closely guarded secret, only known to franciscus himself.  things unfortunately faded away with the girl, as young love tends to do, however adam had inherited his parents work ethic, and turned out to be a natural at making cheese. he and his mentor formed a close bond, with franciscus, who was unable to have a family of his own, loved and looked after adam as if he was his was his own son; and adam himself looked up to him as a father. he had even finally taught adam the secret edam recipe, strengthening the bond between the two.  with the help of adam, franciscus' business went from strength to strength, and after 3 years, he decided to take well deserved vacation for the first time in decades, such was his dedication to caseiculture, safe in the knowledge that his livelihood was in good hands with adam at the helm. he booked himself on a week long cruise down the danube, as he'd always wanted to see the beauty of budapest.   alas, tragedy struck again, as the cruise ship capsized, and franciscus drowned in his cabin. for the second time on his still early life, adam had been left heartbroken. he couldn't bring himself to stay in amsterdam, packed his things and moved back to hong kong.  never one to be fully hindered by adversity, adam used his skills and started his own cheese shop in his hometown. again, thanks to adam's hard work, talent and dedication, this was a roaring success, he made cheeses from all over the world that delighted the taste buds off anyone who tried them. as a tribute to dear old franciscus, he however never sold his world famous edam, only keeping it to make at home and treat those nearest to his heart. despite constant calls from cheese lovers the world over who had tasted the edam in holland, adam never wavered, and the cheese was never sold to the baying public.  adam at this point fell in love with the daughter of the owner of the florist next door to his shop, a beautiful young lady called chen. he finally plucked up the courage to ask chen out, ask took her to the finest restaurant in hong kong. chen fell for adam's wit and charm, and before long they were married in a lavish ceremony.   six months of marital bliss later, chen becomes pregnant. adam is delighted, with his life finally coming together. when chen goes into labour, adam rushes to the hospital. ten painful hours later, and chen gives birth, not to a child, but to a deer! everyone is in shock, and experts the world over descend on hong kong to witness this miracle of science, but no one can explain it.  nevertheless, adam and chen treat the deer as if it was human, and in a fitting tribute name him franciscus after his mentor and father figure, but along the way, shorten it to frank for ease. young frank, despite the media attention, lives a sheltered childhood, and learns to walk, speak, goes to school, and leads as normal a life as an anthropomorphic deer could do.  adam continues to run his now thriving cheese business, and still keeps the masterful edam just for special occasions with his new family, and frank adores it, counting down the days until the next event when adam brings it out to share.  frank continues his education, but a final tragedy was awaiting adam. chen, while out on a sailing holiday in the south china sea with her now retired parents, fell overboard and was killed by a shark attack.   adam, after another cruel accident taking another loved one, cannot take anymore, and moves back to his parents village in xinjiang, as far away from any large water sources as possible. he lives as a recluse, hiding away from the world in grief and sorrow.   it's left to young frank to run the cheese business. he, unfortunately, is not as adept at cheese making or running a business as his father, and the company starts to struggle. realising this, he writes to his father for the legendary edam recipe to sell to help revive the fortunes. his father, now a stubborn, grouchy soul, steadfast refuses out of tribute to franciscus.   frank continues to just about keep the business afloat for the next few years, but every six months sends the same letter to his father asking for the recipe that could turn around his fortunes, but is constantly refused.  finally, frank hears word that adam is on his death bed, his grief stricken body as succumbed to cancer. frank rushes to xinjiang, to find adam in a terrible state, with only hours to live. after a long and tearful goodbye, frank again asks for the recipe.   adam, gives him a long look up and down, and says with his dying breath ""i don't know how many times i have to tell you this, but frank lee, my deer, i don't give edam.""   edit : i feel guilty getting an award for a repost."	1

an old man is hosting his retirement dinner with his family, friends and coworkers heâd lived a long life- when he was only 25 he went on a mission trip to south america where he met two young boys who he later adopted. seeing the standard of living in south america prompted him to study medicine- a field he completely excelled in and successfully developed vaccines for over ten diseases. with the little money he earned from his hard work he immediately donated it back into relief funds for all the places heâd visited.   his coworkers all loved him, ask anyone and theyâll say he was the most positive and bright man theyâd ever met.   this is why it came as no surprise that during his retirement dinner, an angel themself descended from heaven to speak with him.  âyou have lived a giving life, one that many could look up too and many relied on to survive. because of this, we would like to give you a gift- a long and healthy life, all the wealth you could imagine, or unparalleled wisdom.â   the man debates between longevity and wisdom for half a breath but very quickly decides he wants unparalleled wisdom.   the angel reaches down, touches his forehead, and leaves without another word.   the guests at the dinner, still in a partial state of shock, stare in silence at the slack jawed man. eventually, his coworker and closest friend speaks up, âwell? how is it?â   the man replied, âi shouldâve chosen the fuckinâ money.â	1

""freedom means doing whatever you want whenever you feel like it with total disregard for others no matter the consequences it has for the people around you or the destruction it causes. freedom is the broken record answer you give to end every reasonable arguement where someone tries to get you to do something you don't feel like doing.""  the teacher is shocked, the class looks up stunned and confused and the little boy bows his head in dissapointment, tears filling his eyes.  about to console the little boy, the teacher notices the cover of the dictionary and beams a bright smile.  ""don't worry class!"" she rejoices,  ""that one is american english""  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  made in response to all the lockdown protestors in america who won't stfu and stop putting their country to shame. they don't *define* america  &#x200b;  edit: i'm confused by the angry americans, why come to r/jokes without your sense of humour. it's not meant as a slight to america as a whole, just that small group who are protesting the lockdowns.  edit 2: thank you sincerely for all the kind words."	1

"a young lady, destitute and rejected by her lover, heads to the manhattan docks to drown herself. but just before she could throw herself from the docks, a handsome young man stopped her.  ""you have so much to live for,"" said the man. ""i'm a sailor, and we are off to italy tomorrow. i can stow you away on my ship. i'll take care of you, bring you food every day, and keep you happy.""  with nothing to lose, combined with the fact that she had always wanted to go to italy, the woman accepted. that night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold. from then on, every night he would bring her three sandwiches, a bottle of red wine, and make love to her until dawn. three weeks later she was discovered by the captain during a routine inspection.  ""what are you doing here?"" asked the captain.  ""i have an arrangement with one of the sailors,"" she replied. ""he brings me food and wine -- and i get a free trip to italy .""  ""i see,"" the captain says.  her conscience prevailed and she added, ""plus, he's screwing me.""  ""he sure is,"" replied the captain. ""this is the staten island ferry ."""	1

"i was driving in the desert in my 1989 jeep wrangler. i was going for a drive in the vast, dry deserts of nevada. i had just gotten in a fight with my wife, and yes, i might have had a little too much to drink and a little too poor a sense of direction to be doing what i was doing. cacti and tumbleweeds blurred past me as i tried my best to ignore the clunking sound coming out from under the old wrangler's hood. one stretch of road blended into the next. as the road got bumpier, i realized i wasn't even on a road after all, but rather wandering the desert on an uncharted course.  *slortch!* a sickening crunch sent me and my battered mount spiraling and screeching over the coarse, sandy dunes. sand got everywhere. the jeep rammed into a dune with a *thud* and i blacked out.  *""fool of a crook!""* i heard in a thunderous voice. i looked around, panicked. my legs were caught under some jeep guts that had spilled all over me. i couldn't move. *""are all you humans this stupid, or are you an extra rare shiny specimen?""*  ""what?! who's there? what's going on?"" was all i could spew from my confused mouth.  *""i am na'thwhqangq'yi, though those of your kind often call me nathaniel. do you not know what you nearly crashed into?""*  still looking around, i shrugged. ""a wedding party?"" i offered. out of the corner of my eye, a slimy silver snake slithered silently into view.   ""ahem. do you see any extravagant mate pairings in the vicinity? you're hardly doing anyone any favors.""  staring into his beady little eyes, i was shocked to realize that the voice was coming from the snake! it seemed to be some kind of telepathic ability. not only that, he had lowered his voice now that he was closer.  ""well, *nate the snake,*"" i quipped, ""it's not like you've exactly been handing out favors either! what are you, anyway? some kind of area 51 experiment?""  despite the stupidity of my remarks, i heard something like a muffled chuckle. ""nate the snake... i like that. what i am is very old, and beyond your mortal understanding. but i have been imprisoned within this serpentine body for the purpose of guarding the terminus obelisk. it is one spoke of a wheel that, when turned, will ignite ancient flames within this planet that will destroy everything on it. and above it. and outside it, in dimensions you cannot imagine.""  ""huh... and what are the other spokes of this wheel? what does that metaphor even mean?"" i asked.  nate the snake scoffed. ""it's literally a wheel, pal. see that stick over there? in the mud?""  i looked over at some kind of branch-looking thing protruding from a mud pit nearby. a stick in the mud.   ""i'm not your pal, guy! the name's jesse. so... you're telling me if i had hit that switch over there, the entire universe and beyond would have ended?""  nate nodded sagely. ""a stick. a switch. an on/off button for existence, if you will, but more of a lever than a button.""  i snapped ""i'm not will, i'm jesse! pay attention, geez.""  again, that stupid sexy chuckle. ""well i'm not geez, either! nate the snake, remember?""  ""right. by the way, help a pal out and get my legs free, please? i'm not a badass snake like you. i really need to pee.""  the car parts holding me down dimly glowed and were lifted from my legs. i thanked nate heartily and tried to get the jeep started. no luck.  finding i was stuck here, in the middle of the desert, i did what any sane man would do: make conversation with nate the snake. i found out he'd been guarding this obelisk thing for centuries. it really didn't look like an ""obelisk"" to me, though, so i just started calling it the lever of doom, and it stuck.   when i got thirsty, nate was kind enough to lead me to a nearby spring hidden just under a dune that i would have completely missed otherwise. as i drank greedily from the spring, i talked to nate about my life and my problems.  despite coming off as a bit of a jerk at first blush, nate was actually pretty interested in my life. turns out women in lakes handing out swords is no basis for government, but ancient spirits in snakes handing out advice is an excellent basis for turning your life around. we talked for hours and hours about my wife, jamie, how all the little times i pissed her off had added up, how she rearranged my things only because she loved me and wanted to clean up the place.  days passed as i tried to fix the jeep and failed. no cell reception. i had no idea where the nearest town was. nate the snake took pity on me and helped guide me to some wild berries that kept me fed near that mysterious hidden spring. we talked more - about how i felt i was at a dead end at my job, about the career i wanted to pursue and how my manager seemed so much more selfish than other managers in my division. we talked about his abilities, and he showed me some more of the mystical secrets of the desert. he gave me a killer flan recipe. it was all information that i would later take to improve my life immeasurably.  eventually, i found out what was stopping the wrangler from starting. with a few zaps from nate, the engine roared to life.  ""i'm going to miss you, nate the snake. i feel like we really connected these past few weeks.""  ""and i you,"" nate replied. ""but this needn't be goodbye forever. return to this desert, take a left, then a right, and repeat. when you are wandering, when you are lost, you can find me and we can chat once more. however, you must promise ne that you will never tell anyone about the lever of doom.""   i took his blessing and warning to heart. can't believe i even got the old coot to call it the lever of doom, too.  and return to him i did. over the years, as he said, whenever i felt lost in life, i would return to the desert, play the left-right game, and find warm-blooded counsel from nate. he helped me find solace after my first divorce; he held me stable when the market crashed and i felt totally responsible for it; i bought some guns and helped him defend the lever of doom from void-faced legions from hell. nate became my dearest friend in life.  one last day, in my hairs of gray, i took one last drive in the deserts of nevada. i drove my 1989 jeep wrangler, repaired multiple times over the years, like i had many times before. as always, i played the left-right game.  i was glad to see nate's figure in the distance as my jeep approached. old friend, one final visit from me.  *clunk!*   uh oh.  that was not a sound my jeep should have made.  i slammed on the brakes, but nothing happened. the engine roared faster and faster. i was directly on a collision course with the terminus obelisk! that stupid little stick in the mud that could destroy the universe. sweating, i knew i had to make a split second decision... but i knew nathaniel would never forgive me if i didn't do it.  at the last minute, i swerved into my dearest friend, killing him instantly, and yelled,  *better nate than lever!*"	1

"so there's this guy drinking at a bar, getting absolutely shit faced near the end of the night, after he had a few too many, he pukes all over his shirt.  he's yells out ""oh fuck, not again, my wife is going to kill me.""  hearing this, the bartender tells him to take a $20 bill out of his wallet, and put it in his shirt pocket, and when he gets home to tell his wife that someone else puked on him, and gave him $20 to have the shirt cleaned.  thinking this is a great idea, the man heads home to his wife.  as he stumbles into the house, his wife asks what the hell happened.  ""well you see, i was having a quiet night, when this guy puked all over me.  but don't worry, he gave me $20 to have it cleaned.""  he then pulls the bill out of his shirt pocket and gives it to his wife.  the wife looks at the bill and says ""this isn't a $20 bill it's a $50 bill.""  the man responds ""oh right, he also shit my pants."""	1

young gulls the dolphin trainers at the state zoo were very upset because the dolphins were very ill and getting worse. an animal shaman told them that he could not only cure the dolphins, but make them live forever--all he needed were some young sea gulls. the trainers immediately set off to find some young sea gulls.  while looking for the gulls, 2 lions at the zoo escaped. the trainers didn't care--they had to save the dolphins. they found their gulls and were making their way back to the dolphin enclosure when they came across the lions. fortunately, they were sound asleep, having been hit with tranquilizer darts--but they were right in the middle of the path. so, they carefully stepped across the lions, and were immediately arrested. the crime? transporting young gulls across state lions for immortal porpoises.	1

""very well,"" said the voice. the light went out. the sounds of the forest resumed. and then the bear dropped his right paw, brought both paws together and bowed his head and spoke: ""lord, bless this food, which i am about to receive from thy bounty , amen."""	1

army joke? i guess this joke is pretty popular in the armed forces, so i apologize if this is a repeat!  so anyways, once there was a guy, letâs call him steve. so steve has always had trouble with women. his first wife left him, his second wife passed away, and his third ended up having an affair. feeling very lost and depressed, steve decided that in order to leave the troubles of the dating world, he would enlist in the us army.   so come another 3 months or so after his enlistment, steve gets deployed to do a tour in iraq. the first couple of months were relatively easy, getting settled, enjoying the comradery, etc etc. however, after a while, the urges came. steve desired the touch of a woman. so he went and found his friend in his platoon to ask his opinion.   âhey delgado, sitting around and smoking cigarettes all day sucks.. what do you do when.. you know.. you need the touch of a woman?â steve asked.  delgado turned and pointed towards a stable at the end of the driveway.  âyou see that camel over there?â  as soon as he looked, steve felt uneasy. but after a moment of pondering his next 6 months deployed on a base with no women in sight, he decided that if most other men did it too, how bad could it be?  so steve immediately takes off running, all the while unbuckling his belt and starting to remove his trousers. the other privates watch in horror as they hear sounds of bellowing and grunting, and after a while, steve emerges from the stable. he was covered in bruises and scratches, his hair was disheveled, but he was smiling.   his platoon leader rushes up to him, a look of concern on his face.  âsteve! what in godâs name did you do to the camel?â  steveâs satisfied expression was replaced with sheepish embarrassment.  âwell, delgado said to go to the camel stable when i needed to get my rocks off.â steve explained, puzzled.  âprivate, you were supposed to ride the camel into town...â	1

credit to u/draiu john got a job at the local prison. on his first day, he saw a large, muscular man cranking a shaft inside of his cell. he turned to one of his fellow guards and asked, âwhoâs that guy?â, referring to the man cranking the shaft.  âthatâs khan drea. heâs in here for life, but the warden decided to give olâ khan here extra liberties for cranking that shaft,â explained the guard.  âah, that makes sense,â john replied, âbut what does the shaft do?â  âi donât know, you should ask the warden, i never thought much of it.â was the answer he got back.  later, on break, john entered the wardenâs office.  âsorry sir, i just want to know about the deal you made with mr. drea,â john apologized.  the warden looked at john for a minute before answering.  âyou see, john, i give khan extra liberties for cranking that shaft, as you may already know. however, youâre probably wondering what that crank does. itâs simple, really. the state wants us to go green so weâre starting by producing our own green energy. khan is the first step to achieving that goal.â  âoh, i get it now!â john exclaimed, âthe might oâ khan drea is the powerhouse of the cell block!â	1

""i'm sorry, but i'm going to have to resign"", he told the manager.     ""you can't quit!"" the manager exclaimed, ""i'll never find another performer of your caliber."""	1

"a dying wish a man spoke to each of his three sons when he sent them to  college.

""*blame the previous guy.*""  well, sure! i mean, if it wasn't for all the stuff he did in the past, we wouldn't be in this predicament now! i told everyone it was the previous guy's fault, and everyone seemed to accept that. slowly, business got back to normal. i felt like i dodged a bullet. months went by and not a single bump in the road. and then...another emergency. i could hear people yelling my name, and not in a good way. without hesitation, i reached for envelope #2.  ""*blame the support staff*.""  right? i mean, if they were doing their job and told me sooner, i could've fixed all of this before it was even a problem! everyone nodded. couldn't argue with that logic. i was relieved to have dodged another bullet. i must be pretty good at this after all!  a full year went by and, sure, some people had since been let go, but i was still sitting pretty with a good job and a carefree attitude. things just always seemed to work out! when the next crisis hit, i wasn't even phased. i could hear the people yelling my name, and i could almost even imagine them carrying pitchforks all aimed at me. whatever. i still had that final envelope which i opened as everyone was amassed at my door.

"there was once an island kingdom whose people were all fabulously wealthy. even though they could have afforded to live anywhere they wanted, tradition dictated they stay on their tiny island home. eventually, their king became frustrated and called a meeting of the tribe's elders. he said he wanted them to figure out a way he could enjoy his wealth, and stay within traditional guidelines. after much consideration, the elders suggested he build a magnificent throne. when he objected there was not enough room in his hut for a throne, the elders suggested he call in an engineer to solve the problem. soon, the king's tiny hut was rigged with an elaborate system of ropes and pulleys. he could lower the huge throne for use during the day, and at night, he could haul the throne up, and lower his bed. this was truly the best of both worlds for the king.  unfortunately, after a few months of constant use, the ropes frayed, and one night, the throne slipped and came crashing down on the king, killing him. the wise men of the island recognized a lesson in this experience and added to the lore of their people this statement: ""people who live in grass houses should not stow thrones."""	1

"breakfast for the mailman it was george the mailmanâs last day on the job after 35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood.  when he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who roundly and soundly congratulated him and sent him on his way with a tidy gift envelope.  at the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. the folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures. at the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. she took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced.  when he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. when he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. as she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cupâs bottom edge. ""all this was just too wonderful for words, "" he said, ""but whatâs the dollar for?""  ""well,"" she said, ""last night, i told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. i asked him what to give you.  he said, ""fuck him. give him a dollar."" the breakfast ... that was my idea."""	1

"for the last time, no! no! noooo! so, there's this man. he's young, healthy, reasonably attractive, good job, etc.  only problem is, he has a 25 inch penis. this might might sound great if you're a 12 year old, but it soon becomes the bane of his existence. every time he meets a nice lady, eventually things lead to the bedroom and without fail, they all run screaming. he can't seem catch a break.  fed up, the man goes to the doctor and tells him of his woes, shows him his giant problem, asking if anything can be done for him.  ""i'm sorry,"" the doctor replies. ""the only thing that we can do to reduce the size of your penis is surgery. it's not covered by your insurance, unfortunately, and as an elective procedure, its exorbitantly expensive.""  the man slumps his shoulders, crestfallen and dismayed. seeing his reaction, the doctor grows sympathetic.   ""you know"", he begins. ""it's a long shot but there's something you could try""   the man perks up, filled with hope.   ""please, please tell me, doctor. i'll do anything"" he says.   the doctor takes a deep breath.   ""ok. you know the woods over on the south side of town?""   the man nods, curious as the doctor continues.   ""well, if you go into the woods you'll come across a trail. and if you take that trail for about 5 miles, you'll come to a small pond.""   the man listens intently, unsure of what this doctor could be getting at.   ""now, near the deep end of the pond you'll find a lily pad, and on top of the lily pad, you'll find a frog.""   the man gives the doctor his undivided attention, his mind racing at how any of this information could possibly help him. the doctor continues.   ""you walk up to the frog. make your wish silently to yourself and then you ask the frog to marry you. when the frog says no, your wish will be granted.""   the man is angry. this doctor got his hopes up only to play the cruelest of pranks on him. he gets up and storms out in a huff.   a month goes by, and another lovely woman he just knows could be the one flees in terror from him after the 3rd date. the man is beside himself with despair.   on one particularly low afternoon, the man decides to go for a long walk. by chance, he finds himself on the south side of town and stops before a line of trees leading to a stretch of woods beyond.   wandering through the woods, the man comes to a path leading deeper in. almost without thinking, the man begins to follow it. after walking just long enough to forget why he's walking, the man sees the trail end off in the distance. as he gets closer, he sees that beyond the trail is a small pond.   it can't be, he tells himself. there's no way the doctor's story could be true.   sure enough, at the deep end of the pond, he sees a lily pad, and a large, cartoonishly green frog sitting on top.   the man is bewildered. the frog looks at him, staring straight into his eyes. am i really going to do this? he slowly walks up to the frog, repeating to himself, ""i wish i had a smaller penis"", over and over.   he reaches the frog and asks, ""hey frog. will you marry me?""   the frog blinks, eyes still locked to the man, and calmly says, ""no."" immediately, his penis shrinks 5 inches.  the man is shocked and elated. he can't believe it worked. he's just about to turn back home when he thinks to himself, 20 inches is still way too long. he steels himself to try again, and walks up to the frog a second time.   ""hey frog,"" he says, a bit louder""will you marry me!?""   the frog says again, matching the man's tone ""no!"" his penis shrinks another 5 inches.  the man can barely contain himself. he's overcome with joy and he thinks to himself, just one more time and it'll be perfect!   he proudly walks up to the frog and shouts, ""hey frog, will you marry me!?!?""   the frog immediately replies, ""for the last time, no, no, noooo!!!"""	1

there once was this guy who was going on a date to the movies with a beautiful girl. -edit my dad told me this joke and i just got some of the parts i remembered but iâm pretty sure this is all it  before he went, he made the mistake of eating a jumbo can of beans. right after he picked her up, he felt the need to fart, but he figured he could wait until they got to the movies. when they got there, he asked her if she wanted some popcorn and coke. she said sure, so he went to the restroom. the line was long, so he went back to the lobby, got the food, and went back into the theatre. when the movie was over, he goes to the bathroom again, still with a tremondously long line. so he figures he can wait until he drops her off. when they pull up into her driveway, she exclaims, ''oh goodie. my grandparents are here. come on in and meet them.'' he agrees, although his a-hole is about to cry at this point. they go in and sit down at the table. finally, he couldn't hold it in any longer a tried to let it seep out a little at a time. as he squeezed out a toxic blast, he aimed it towards the family's hound dog ashe, in hopes that they might blame the pooch for the horrendous fart. the girl's father stands up and hollers ''ash!!'' and sits back down. ''great!'' he thought. ''they really think it's the dog!'' so, he starts bombarding the room with a couple, more powerful, louder stinkers. once again, the girl's father stands up, shouts ''ashe!!'' and sits back down. finally, he lets it all go and the loudest most asshole hair curling fart you've ever heard or smelt rippled through the dining room. the girl's father stands up again. ''ash, get the hell out from under him before he shits on you!!''	1

""i don't have a clue!!!"" the rabbi said.  ""first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger. then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here.""  ""and then what?"" asked a woman.  ""who knows!!"" said the rabbi. ""he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!"""	1

cowboy rides into a dusty town on his horse and stops at a saloon... he ties up his horse, goes up the the bar, sits at the counter, and orders a couple beers to quench his thirst. when he walks out, he realizes his horse is missing!   he flings those saloon doors open, hand on his pistol, and shouts, âwhich one of you sidewinding sons of bitches stole my horse.â the men at the bar just stared at him. he whips out his pistol and shoots an empty glass across the room with deadly accuracy. âiâll tell you what,â said the cowboy, âiâm gonna walk over to that bar and drink me one last beer. if i get done with that beer and my horse isnât right where i left him, iâm gonna have to do what i did in texas... and believe you me... i donât want to have to do what i did in texas...â   a few moments later, he starts to get to the bottom of his drink and the men in the saloon start shifting on their seats out of nervousness. the cowboy flips a coin to the bartender, slams his glass down, and walks outside. sure enough, there was his horse - right where he left him.   he saddled up and started to ride towards the horizon. the bartender was burning with curiosity and ran out to catch up to him. he busted out the door yelling, âcowboy wait! what did you have to do in texas?â   the cowboy looked at him and said, âhell, i had to walk all the way home!â	1

"the gift *trust me its too long to be worth reading.*  a young man wanted to purchase a gift for his new sweetheart's birthday, and as they had not been dating very long, after  careful consideration, he decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note romantic, but not too personal. accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to nordstrom's and bought a pair of white gloves. the sister purchased a pair of panties for herself.during the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the gloves and the sweetheart got the panties.without checking the contents, the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart with the following note:  ""i chose these because i noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing any when we go out in the evening. if it had not been for your sister, i would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears short ones that are easier to remove. these are a delicate shade, but the lady i bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly soiled. i had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart. i wish i was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt other hands will come in contact with them before i have a chance to see you again.when you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away as they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.just think how many times i will kiss them during the coming year. i hope you will wear them for me on friday night. all my love. p.s. the latest style is to wear them folded down with little fur showing.""  with love"	1

""i sort by smell, texture and feel."" says the guy.  ""ok"", says the boss, ""let's see how you go.""  he sits the guy down in the warehouse and has the boys bring in several differently sized pieces of wood which he hands to the guy one after the other.  ""that's easy!"", says the guy about the first piece, ""that's sitka spruce, 2 by 4.""  ""ahh, trying to be tricky are you? well, i'm not easily fooled, that's brazilian mahogany, 1 by 1 square."" he says of the second piece.  this goes on for 20 minutes and no matter what they bring, he gets the wood type right.  finally the boss has had enough and he steps out to reception where gets his wife to step out of her undies. he tells the guy that if he gets this one right, by smell alone, he's got the job.  the boss holds the panties close to the guy's nose and he recoils with a very puzzled look on his face. he's definitely stumped and asks the owner if he can have another smell.  the boss turns the panties around and let's him try again. once more the guy looks puzzled and then he smiles knowingly.

was reminded of my dadâs favorite joke when i saw a similar joke posted earlier today. he owns his own construction company and would tell this to everyone. all the body parts get together to decide who is the boss of the body.  first is the brain. âitâs obvious iâm the boss. iâm the smartest and without me the body wouldnât even know what to do.â  the hands speak up and say, âwithout us the body wouldnât be able to get food to the mouth. the body couldnât drive, use tools, etc.â  the feet go next and say, âwell without us the body wouldnât get anywhere. it couldnât walk, dance, play sports.â  each body part gets a turn giving the reasons why they are the most important and should be the boss.  last to go is the asshole. it claims it is the boss and every other body part just laughs and makes fun of the asshole. âwhat do you do? you have the least important job.â so the asshole closes as tight as it can and lets nothing get by it.  after a few hours the other body parts are starting to feel weird but donât concede that the asshole is the boss. close to a week passes and the feet are feeling weak, the hands canât grab things as well, and the brain canât think clearly. still, the asshole stays shut tight.  a few more days pass and all the other body parts can barely function at all. the body keeps falling because the feet canât keep it up. itâs hungry because the hands canât pick up food and the brain canât even think straight.  finally all the body parts concede that the asshole is the most important body part. so the asshole opens up and everything soon returns to normal for the other body parts.   so to be the boss you donât have to be smart, strong, or extremely useful. you just need to be an asshole.	1

"several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community...   if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.  the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.  however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.  on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other.  the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.  the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.  next, the pope waved his finger around his head.  the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.  the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.  the rabbi pulled out an apple.  with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever.  the jews could stay in italy!  later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened.  the pope said, ""first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs. then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us. finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. he bested me at every move and i could not continue!""  meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won.  ""i don't have a clue!!!"" the rabbi said.  ""first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger. then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here.""  ""and then what?"" asked a woman.  ""who knows!!"" said the rabbi. ""he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!"""	1

"series of jokes translated from armenian some context: abaran is a city in armenia, and there's this stereotype about the ""abarantsi"" (person from abaran) who is supposed to be stupid and there's a bunch of jokes about it, kind of like blonde jokes (this is all for the sake of the joke, however, and we love and respect the people of abaran). the jokes are mostly traditional and pretty old, so they're not super creative.    here are some of the jokes:  * an abarantsi is taken to jail and has to take a lie detector test. the officers explain that they will ask questions, and if he answers truthfully, a green light will flash, but if he lies the light will turn red. the officers ask him, ""do you understand?"". he replies yes and the light turns red.  * an abarantsi pricks his finger on a rose thorn. he takes the thorn out, and his finger starts bleeding, so he puts the thorn back in.  * an abarantsi's house catches on fire, so he calls the firefighters. they tell him they will be there in 10 minutes. he adds hay to the fire so it won't burn out before they get there.  * how can you tell which house is the abarantsi's in the wintertime? the curtains will be hung outside to keep the house warm.  * how can you tell which airplane is the abarantsi's? it will have armpit hair under its wings.  * an abarantsi is shopping for shoes. he sees the shoe sizes, 8, 9 and 10, and asks the salesman--are these the speeds of the shoes? * an abarantsi killed his twin brother. when he is arrested and asked why he did this, he says ""i was trying to kill myself and i got confused"" * an abarantsi taxi driver is asked how long a round trip will take from yerevan (capital of armenia) to abaran. he replies, two hours to abaran and three hours back to yerevan. when asked why it takes longer to get back to yerevan, he says, ""do you think it's easy to back up that far?""  this one's an added bonus, it's a joke from lori, another armenian city-  a dying man tells his wife to dress nicely and wear her finest jewelry. she asks, how could i have the spirit to dress like that when you're dying? he replies, when the angel of death sees you like that, he might decide to take you instead of me."	1

joke from my southern grandmother i havenât seen this one on here before, but maybe iâve just missed it. here goes:  back yonder in the olden days, little johnny would have to walk to the school house for class. as with many young children, johnny was very imaginative and would play pretend with sticks and branches, sword fightinâ with other children, or dragginâ the stick along fences along the way.   each day he would get a stick, run it along the neighborâs fence, walk up the hill, and smack the old outhouse at the top of the hill, to scare anyone who might be inside. he would then ditch the stick and run down the hill to class before anyone saw him. it was well-known that his school teacher, mrs. smith, would often use that outhouse before a long day teaching at the schoolhouse, and if you smacked the door hard enough, sheâd give a fearful yelp. johnny had been told not to do these things often, but all the other kids did them too, so it wasnât likely heâd be caught, so long as he ran away quick enough.   one day, little johnny followed his regular routine, dragginâ his stick along the neighborâs fence, climbinâ the hill with his stick, smackinâ the old outhouse with it, then chucking the stick and running down the hill as fast as he could. no one helped from inside the outhouse. but today was different.   as he ran down the hill, he heard a thunderinâ crash as wood splintered and tumbled down the hill. realizing whatâd happened, johnny hid in the woods, gathered his composure, and walked to class from a different direction than yonder hill. as he walked into the school house, he saw neighbors walking towards the hill from every which-a-way, like gnats to a fresh apple pie.   in school that day mrs. smith, no doubt having heard what happened, spent a large portion of the lessons focusing on honesty and integrity. she taught the class about george washington, how he had cut down his fatherâs cherry tree, but was honest about it because he could not tell a lie, and how washington is admired to this day for his integrity. johnny burned with guilt all day long.  after school, johnny didnât even pick up a stick, and he just walked around the hill on his way home.   at the dinner table that night, johnny kept staring at his food and stayed silent as the grave. finally, his dad asked him, âjohnny, how was your day?â  bursting with guilt, johnny replied, âdaddy, i cannot tell a lie! this morning i got a stick like i ainât sâposed to, and i dragged it along the fence like i ainât sâposed to, and i went up the hill and hit the olâ outhouse like i wasnât sâposed to, and that olâ outhouse went just a-crashinâ down yonder hill. itâs all my fault! i cannot tell a lie!â  his dad frowned and said, âjohnny, iâm just ashamed at your behavior. youâre gettinâ two spankinâs, double chores this week, and youâre grounded for a month.â  johnny, in tears, replied, âbut daddy! george washington told the truth about choppinâ down his daddyâs cherry tree, and he didnât get in trouble, and thatâs way worse than what i done. how come iâm in trouble?â  âbecause, son, george washingtonâs daddy wasnât *in* that cherry tree.â	1

""*it must have been a bear attack*"", said the frenchman. ""*let's start searching for our friend, the czech.*""  a few hundred meters from the camp, the frenchman and the irishman came upon a pair of bears. a couple of quick shots from their rifles quickly finished the two bears.  let's look inside the bears to see if they ate our friend, said the irishman. quickly they cut open the female bear's stomach, only to find a few berries. next, they cut open the male's stomach. unfortunately, inside it was the body of their friend.  the moral of the story? **the czech is in the male**."	1

"veronicaâs husband died young and left his vast coconut estate to her. veronica was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the properties, but knew very little about coconut farming, so she spread the word that she needed a man to look after the estate.  two men applied for the job. one was the local drunk handyman, sebastio, and the other was benedict who was gay.  veronica thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied for the job she decided to hire benedict, figuring it would be safer to have a gay around the house than a drunk.  benedict proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about caring for coconut trees. for weeks, the two of them worked side by side, and the coconut plantation was soon flourishing.  then one saturday the widow veronica said to benedict, ""you have done a really good job, and the farm and the coconut trees look great. you should take a break and go out and have a good time. maybe watch a movie or go for a dance. here's some money. have a blast!""  benedict readily agreed and went into town that saturday night.  one o'clock came and no benedict  two o'clock and no benedict.  finally benedict returned around two-thirty in the morning, and upon entering the room, he found the widow veronica sitting in the candlelit hall with a glass of wine, waiting for him.  she quietly called him over to her.  'unbutton my blouse and take it off,' she said.  trembling, he did as she directed..  'now take off my shoes.'  he did as she asked, ever so slowly.  'now take off my stockings.'  he removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.  ""now take off my skirt.'  he slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the candlelight.  'now take off my bra.'  again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.  then she looked at him and said,  ââif you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired.ââ"	1

a rural farm wife called the local phone company to report her telephone failed to ring when her friends called and that on the few occasions, when it did ring, her dog always moaned right before the phone rang. the telephone repairman proceeded to the scene, curious to see this psychic dog or senile lady.  he climbed a telephone pole, hooked in his test set, and dialed the subscriber's house. the phone didn't ring right away, but then the dog moaned and the telephone began to ring.  climbing down from the pole, the telephone repairman found:  1. the dog was tied to the telephone system's ground wire with a steel chain and collar. 2. the wire connection to the ground rod was loose. 3. the dog was receiving 90 volts of signaling current when the number was called. 4. after a couple of jolts, the dog would start moaning and then urinate. 5. the wet ground would complete the circuit, thus causing the phone to ring.  which demonstrates that some problems can be fixed by pissing and moaning.	1

""if the only way i can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do i become a monk?""  the monks reply, ""you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk."" the man sets about his task. some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.  he says,"" i have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. there are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth"".  the monks reply, ""congratulations. you are now a monk. we shall now show you the way to the sound"".  the monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, ""the sound is right behind that door"". the man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.  he says, ""real funny. may i have the key?"" the monks give him the key, and he opens the door. behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.  the man demands the key to the stone door. the monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. he demands another key from the monks, who provide it.  behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, and so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.  finally, the monks say, ""this is the last key to the last door"".  the man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end.  he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.  but he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk."	1

""it's a rule that if you fart, it implies that you called for me."" the huge man easily spins him around, bends him over a bench and has his way with him.  the newcomer staggers back to the colony office where he is greeted by the smiling, naked receptionist. ""may i help you?"" she asks.  the man yells, ""here's my membership card. you can have the key back and you can keep the $500 membership fee.""  ""but, sir,"" she replies, ""you've only been here for a few hours. you haven't had the chance to see all our facilities.""  the man replies, ""listen lady, i'm 63 years old. i only get an erection once a month. i fart 15 times a day. i'm outta here!"""	1

"a story about a man named yuri there once was a man named yuri.  yuri had lived in russia all of his life, in a small town near moscow. the town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. he worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. it was hard work, and yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.  every day, while yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. the billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that yuri had little interest in. today, however, yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. it read, ""swimming lessons"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. this ad had given yuri something to be interested in. he had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 rubles base fee.  yuri was sad, because this was much more than yuri could afford to spend. however, he thought to himself, ""if i could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, i should have enough..."" after this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. he even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. finally, at the end of the month, yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.  every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. he had started quickly and advanced rapidly. everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in moscow. it was truly a passion of yuri's.  a few months had passed, and yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across russia, considering a swimming prodigy. yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. however, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. for him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.  later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. while it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""diving practices"" in big letters. diving was something that yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. the pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for yuri to practice diving. however, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. he looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. the base fee was 7500 rubles.  yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. the factory was beginning to offer less and less money to yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. he had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. however, yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.  the practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. he continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.  many people had heard of yuri at this point. several news stories across russia were focused around yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. he continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""it is only something i am fond of, a hobby"" yuri would say. ""i still have a life in the factory that i must attend to every day. it is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what i use to keep myself healthy."" despite his fame and popularity, yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. despite all of yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.  for yet another time, yuri was on his way to the factory. the billboard had changed once again. yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""travel to america today!"" read the ad. yuri was very interested. he had always heard of america, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. the land of the free! it was a very exciting idea to yuri. however, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. unfortunately, he thought correctly. the boats that traveled to america were advertised as costing 60,000 rubles.  yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. the factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. however, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. it truly was his passion, and yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.  finally, the year had passed, and yuri had finally saved up enough rubles to be able to ride the boat to america. he climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. the boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. the boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. about a day had passed when people had finally recognized yuri, the famed russian swimmer and diver. they were all very excited to meet yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""it is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. it is something i use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" yuri would always respond to his fans.  one day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. it was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. one of the passengers asked yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""hey, yuri! while we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? i would love to see them!"" yuri was hesitant at first. another passenger asked, ""and maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? the water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" yuri replied, ""well... ok, if you all insist i do it.""  yuri looked off the side of the boat. on the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. with the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. his fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. as he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for yuri to land smoothly in the water.  unfortunately, yuri never landed in the water. he landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. the impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. many people were about to call for medics when yuri managed to get up slowly. ""are you alright yuri? that fall looked hard! that must have broken some bones!"" yuri, however, had barely an injury. as he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. this had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. instead, yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.  ""it is ok, everybody"" yuri yelled back. ""i have endured many hardships in my life."""	1

""then he got down on his knees and began to lick her body, starting with her breasts and slowly going down and down.""  the parrot pauses for a long time...

""on hh..his.. pe.. penis it has a..word...swan!""  and then she ran off to her room.  the  next morning sister gertrude harmony of the assumption quite sternly takes over as the ward of the sailor, lecturing the girls over breakfast of the sins of curiosity and the flesh!  âis it true?â asked marta. âdoes he truly have âswanâ tattooed on his spear of adam?ââiâll hear no more of this nonsense!!â yells sister gertrude as she storms out the room.  but the young ladies only became more intrigued. being a particularly observant lot, they knew sister gertrude loved the communion wine as much as she loved the lord. so one night the postulates fortified the sacrament with some brandy. soon sister gertrude was snoring.  all the girls were anxious, but none could muster the courage! such trepidation!  how does a young lady ask to see a strange manâs penis in a way that would be pleasing to the lord?  a bath! fetch water and soap! sshh!!  donât wake sister marry clarance or sister gertrude.  theyâll have our habits!!   while the four or so ladies scrambled for an alibi, the rest formed a circle around one. she was shy, quiet, timid, and quite pretty.  me!?! she asked.âdo it for us mary? please?! we may never see one! you must tell us what itâs like! and if it truly has a word on it.  mary  gathered her nerve, and sighed deeply. then she took the wash basin, and with a confidence nobody knew she had, marched right into the sailorâs room.  she was even humming. ten minutes later, the humming stopped.twenty minutes later, strange noises  the girls have never heard started.  forty minutes later, the ringleader of the postulates stood by the door, banging on it every five minutes to hush them up.  over an hour later, mary came out the door, hair neat, habit in place, only a bit of flush and glow to give her away.  all the rest swarmed her like geese.âso...ââso what?â she saidâwell does it...say...âmary cut her off âdoes it say âswan?ââmary turned and walked to the door turning back from the doorway she looked them all in the eye and smiled and said..  âno, it says ""saskatchewanâ  edit: word spacing"	1

"a day at the university    i posted a joke that gained some popularity before getting deleted for breaking the rules of the community. as there are people who ask me what the joke was, i'll try to reformulate it so that it complies with the rules.  carrynegie melon university, penisylvania. prof. mary armstrong gives a lecture on spherical fruit transportation 101:  ""in 1864, prof. anne holder, csc., postulated that the upper limit of the number of watermelons carried by an average person is one - carrying the melon in both hands. for as long as 150 years the limit was believed to be absolute. then, the collective of scientists at this university, led by myself, falsified this conjecture by theoretical proof that a person can carry as many as *two* watermelons in a single session, holding one under their left arm, and the other one under their right arm. by raising the upper limit twofold, this extraordinary...""  ""with all due respect,"" exclaims one of the students, antonio sharpe, ""my calculations suggest that it is feasible for the person to carry *three* average-sized watermelons!""  ""oh, and how so, mr. sharpe?""  ""i would utilize your solution with one fruit under each arm and extend it by penetrating the third melon with my penis and carrying the fruit on it.""  ""mr. sharpe, aside from the partiality of your solution which does not allow female transportpersons, it is also a violation of the university rules for ethical discourse. now, let me finish my lecture.""  ""i can easily carry five,"" says another student, john buttrich.  ""oh please, can we stop this nonsense? i'm pretty sure you couldn't do that, mr. buttrich.""  ""but i can. i put one melon under my left arm, the second one under my right arm, and i penetrate tony with my penis, thus carrying also all three melons he is carrying. q. e. d."""	1

[long] my company is locked down and i am required to work from home i'm used to working in an open office space so this is a huge change for me. in order to make the transition as easy as possible, i have prepared my home office so remind me of work.  * i've purchased a piece of limburger cheese and placed it on a plate in the middle of the room to remind me of the smell of certain colleagues i'm now prevented from seeing. * i've placed a few pieces of cardbord in all window panes in order to produce a draft. * i've purchased ten portable radios and tuned them to different talk radio channels, adjusting the volume to slightly above normal conversation volume. at least one radio channel host has a loud and penetrating laughter. half of the channels are allowed some professional content, but no more. * i've had automatic blinds installed but asked the installer to reverse the motor so the blinds go up when the sun shines through my window and down when it gets cloudy. * i found a handful of old mobile phones and installed some loud and distinctive ring tones that i found online. i've agreed with my colleagues that they call them a few times per hour, avoiding the temptation to answer them until my colleagues hang up--like in the office. * for a proper coffee experience, i brew my coffee the day before. whenever i need a cup of coffee, i reheat the entire bottle in the microwave and pour myself a cup. * i have purchased both a cooling unit and a heating unit. they are adjusted so that the cooling unit engages at two degrees higher than the heating unit disenages. it is important for them to thus compete against each other, becaues otherwise i won't get a lifelike simulation of the hvac system in our office. * i have replaced all of my office plants with wax plants--you know, those plants that are typically arranged in a upright torus and bark covering the soil. they require minimal maintenance, and require only some cuts and adjustments every now and then, thus being treated much like all other life in the office. * whenever i begin working on a task, i start an egg timer so that it takes no more than 23 minutes before i get interrupted. * i've invested in an electrically adjustable desk. i realize that only few people actually make use of this feature but it sends an important message about the company's concern for the well-being of its employees. if your have no pain in your back, then everything is fine. * i remove all of my personal items, pc connections, etc. from my desk every affternoon, because although i intend to use them all the next morning, i must be reminded that i can never know where i will be placed on the next work day. * i've printed a number of us letter-sized sheets with text and accompanying stikc men (m/f, of course) that communicate how to be considerate of your employees. this is exclusively to set a proper atmosphere because just like in the office, no-one follows the recommendations. * i have installed an additional dhcp server on my home network in order to get ip address conflicts. * it will be expensive, but at least once a week i'll be hiring a construction team to perform noisy work.	1

"in the year 2010, the lord came unto noah and said: âonce again, the earth has become wicked and over-populated, and i see the end of all flash before me. build another ark and save 2 of every living thing along with a few good humans.""   he gave noah the blueprints, saying,  ""you have 6 months to build the  ark  before i will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights.   six months later, the lord looked down and saw noah weeping in his yard - but no ark. ""noah !"" he roared.    i'm about to start the rain !    where is the ark ?"" ""forgive me, lord,"" begged noah, ""but things have changed. ""  "" i needed a building permit.   i've been arguing with the inspector about the need for a sprinkler system.   my neighbors claim that i've violated the neighbourhood zoning laws by building the  ark in my yard and exceeding the height  limitations.   we had to go to the development appeal board for a decision.      then the department of transportation demanded a bond be posted for the future costs of moving power lines  and other overhead obstructions, to clear the passage for the ark 's move to the sea.   i told them that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear nothing of it.   getting the wood was another problem.    there's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the spotted owl.   i tried to convince the environmentalists that i needed the wood to save the owls - but no go !   when i started gathering the animals, an animal rights' group sued me.  they insisted that i was confining wild animals against their will.  they argued the accommodations were too restrictive, and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space.      then the epa ruled that i couldn't build the  ark  until they'd conducted an environmental impact study on your proposed flood.      i'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the human rights commission on how many minorities i'm supposed to hire for my building  crew.      immigration and naturalisation are checking the residential status of most of the people who want to work.      the trades unions say i can't use my sons.    they insist i have to hire only union workers with ark-building experience.      to make matters worse, the tax office seized all my assets, claiming i'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species.      so, forgive me, lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark. ""      suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine, and a rainbow stretched across the sky.      noah looked up in wonder and asked, ""you mean you're not going to destroy the world ?""     ""no,"" said the lord. âthe government clearly beat me to itâ"	1

"never hire a man to do a woman's job   a few months ago, there was an opening with the cia for an assassin. these highly classified positions are hard to fill, and there's a lot of testing and background checks involved before you can even be considered for the position.  after sending some applicants through the background checks, training and testing, they narrowed the possible choices down to two men and a woman, but only one position was available.  the day came for the final test to see which person would get the extremely secretive job. the cia men administering the test took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. ""we must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances,"" they explained. ""inside this room, you will find your wife sitting in a chair. take this gun and kill her.""  the man got a shocked look on his face and said, ""you can't be serious! i could never shoot my own wife!"" well,"" said the cia man, ""you're definitely not the right man for this job then.""  so they bring the second man to the same door and hand him a gun. ""we must know that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances,"" they explained to the second man. ""inside you will find your wife sitting in a chair. take this gun and kill her.""  the second man looked a bit shocked, but nevertheless took the gun and went in the room. all was quiet for about five minutes, then the door opened. the man came out of the room with tears in his eyes. ""i tried to shoot her. i just couldn't pull the trigger and shoot my wife. i guess i'm not the right man for the job.""  ""no,"" the cia man replied. ""you don't have what it takes. take your wife and go the hell home.""  now they're down to the woman left to test. again they lead her to the same door and hand her the same gun. ""we must be sure that you will follow instructions no matter what the circumstances. this is your final test. inside you will find your husband sitting in a chair. take this gun and kill him.""  the woman took the gun and opened the door. before the door even closed all the way, the cia heard the gun start firing, one shot after another, for 13 shots. then they heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. this went on for several minutes, then all went quiet. the door opened slowly, and there stood the woman.  she wiped the sweat from her brow and said, ""you guys didn't tell me the gun was loaded with blanks! i had to beat the son of a bitch to death with the chair!"""	1

the four witch covens there were once four powerful witch covens: the witches of the mountains, the deserts, the forests, and the seas. for a thousand years they made war with one another, casting curses and hexes and bringing all manner of malady to the land in their hatred for one another. one day, they decided the only solution was to convene for a meeting of all the covens, in which they would either strike a deal for peace, or end it all in violent bloodshed.  the sea witches arrived first, carried upon a tidal wave that bore them up and onto the coast, the waters crashing loudly as they struck the shoreline as if to announce their presence.  the mountain witches rode down the hillside upon magical stormclouds, thunder and lightning bursting from their steeds of vapor, a tumultuous blizzard ravaging the mountains in their wake.  the forest witches, shape-shifters, emerged in the form of gnarled roots which encircled the meeting place and rose out of the ground, bending and twisting into humanoid silhouettes from which sprung skin and clothing, as a flurry of leaves swirled around furiously.  the sand witches arrived in a catering truck.	1

"there was a vulture who had a rebellious son. he would preen his feathers so they stood up, hang out with raccoons, and generally be a nuisance to the rest of the flock. thinking that it was just a phase, his father didn't worry too much about it and hoped that one day his son would grow up.  however, one day his son came home with terrible news: ""dad, i've made up my mind i'm going vegetarian!""  he could accept anything else, but that! shocked, he threw his son out of his house.  as the months and years went by, he regretted his decision, and decided that maybe he should try to understand his son's point of view. so he read up about the nutritional value of plants, looked up recipes, and even asked the neighbouring squirrels about what they ate.  finally, one cold evening, he decided that it was time to try out eating plants. peas were a good place to start- they were high in protein, like the rotting flesh he usually ate, and they were easy for him to eat with his beak. so in addition to his usual plate of roadkill, he put on a pot of peas to boil.  suddenly there was a knock at the door. he opened it and gasped with surprise- there was his son, thin as sticks and weak as water! his son collapsed into his wings, and managed to croak out,  ""dad, i'm starving. do you have anything for me to eat?""  crying at seeing his long-lost child after so many years, he nodded and said,  ""carrion, my wayward son! there'll be peas when you are done."""	1

my late grandfathers favorite joke there was an american wrestler from texas named john, who throughout his high school career had never lost a match. as he went on into college he continued undefeated. he became a national icon and symbol of american strength.  news began to circulate of a russian wrestler who was fierce and unstoppable. as each wrestlers legends grew, a match was set up between the two, america versus russia. the match would be held in texas.  john began training immediately. every day his coach would tell him, âthis russian has a move called the mongolian death grip. no one has ever escaped the mongolian death grip. do not let him get you in the mongolian death gripâ  the day of the match finally came. just before each wrestler stepped onto the mat in front of the capacity crowd, the coach once again said, âwhatever you do, do not let him get you in the mongolian death grip. no one has ever escaped the mongolian death gripâ.   four seconds into the match, the russian had the american in the mongolian death grip. the coach buried his face into his hands and cursed john for not listening to his advice. all of the sudden he heard the crowd irrupt in a chant of usa usa usa. he looked up and saw the russian pinned by john. the coach ran out to meet john and embarrassingly told him, âi didnât see... once he had you in the mongolian death grip i looked away. how in the world did you get out of the mongolian death grip?â  with heavy breath, john told him âwell coach, that russian grabbed me and twisted my body in ways i never imagined possible. i was wincing in pain when i open my eyes and right in front of me were two testicles. so i bit them.â  âwhat???â said the coach... âjohn i donât think that is legal. you could be disqualifiedâ  âi donât know about that coach. but i can tell you one thing. you ainât got no idea how strong you are until you bite your own ballsâ  (today is the anniversary of my grandfatherâs passing, and i posted this because he has been on my mind since i woke up. i just saw the response that this has garnered and i am fuckin crying. thank you all so much. you have made this day so much better)	1

"a group of politicians started a band with al gore as the drummer.  old al could never get the hang of keeping time, though: he would play 3/4 beats on 4/4 songs and 2/4 beats on 3/4 songs.  it was always a mess, but the band tried to work through things and kept playing shows in spite of al's problems.  obviously, they weren't very successful.  after a while, the rest of the band members came together and convinced al to go back and get some more drumming lessons.  once there, he quickly realized his mistakes and changed the way he drummed.  this caused the band to become much more popular.  after one particularly successful show a journalist approached the lead singer and asked a question: ""why do you think your band has had so much success lately?""  the leader thought for a second a then replied ""well, i think it all got better after we changed the al gore rhythm."""	1

""do you wanna go to homecoming with me?"" the girl took a second to respond, but she ended up saying yes. his face lit up in joy. after that encounter, he went straight home to let out his joy. when he got home realization hit him in the face. he was not prepared at all. he never expected to go, let alone his crush saying yes.  he had to get a tuxedo for himself, a corsage to give to his crush  and a limo for them to go to the party to.       right away he dropped his stuff and went to the tuxedo rental store. when he got there he saw a long tux line stretching halfway across the block. it was the only tuxedo store nearby so he stood in line. so he waited, and waited and waited. a couple of hours later, it was his turn. the boy approaches a worker there,        ""please tell me you still have a tux for me."" the man with a slight grin says "" lucky for you, i have exactly one more"". happy as ever, the boy accepts and buys the tux.       after leaving the store, he runs to a nearby floral place to buy a corsage for his crush. when he gets there, he sees a long floral line stretching across the block. it was the only nearby store he could get a corsage, so he stood in line. and he waited, and waited and waited. finally his turn comes up and greets an elderly woman. he approaches her and says ""please tell me you still have a corsage for me"" . the old lady happy as ever says ""lucky for you, i have exactly one more.""          without hesitation, the boy buys the corsage and runs to the nearby limo rental kiosk. when he gets there he sees a long limo line wrapping around the block. it was the only nearby place where he can get a limo, so he stood in line. and he waited, and waited and waited. finally, his turn comes up and greets an elderly man. he approaches him and asks, ""please tell you still have a limo for me.""           the man bright  as ever smiles and says ""lucky for you i have exactly one more.""             without hesitation the boy rents the limo and heads home ready for homecoming.              a few days pass and it's homecoming. he picks up his crush in his tux, gives her the corsage, and they leave in the limo to go to the party. when they get inside, he sees the dancefloor to the left and the refreshments table with a bowl of punch to the right. the boy asks his crush if she would like some punch. she says yes, so he approaches  the punch table, sees the punch and there is no punchline."	1

"when rumpelstiltskin was a young man, he lived in rural kent. in this part of kent all the farmers grew hops for making beer. the fields were full of hops, and the countryside was dotted with oasts, little round buildings for drying them out.  now, as you know, rumpelstiltskin would go on to be famous for his magical ability to turn straw into solid gold, but he first learnt his skill using the local hops. every night he went out with his little scythe, reaped a few hops from the corner of a field, and turned them into gold back at home. he knew it was dishonest, but he took such tiny quantities that the farmers never noticed.  over time, though, rumpelstiltskin noticed his gold was fetching less money at the market. his steady supply had driven the price of gold down, and he was going to need more hops to make the same money.  so he cleared bigger and bigger areas each night, and before long the farmers noticed there was a hop thief about. worse, it was taking rumpelstiltskin the entire night to gather all the hops that he needed. soon he wouldn't have enough hours of darkness to keep up.  just as things were looking bleak for him, rumpelstiltskin had a brilliant idea. the farmers and labourers were already doing the time-consuming work of harvesting the hops and piling them up inside the oasts. if he wanted to grab hops quickly, he just had to break into one of the oasts. instead of reaping the fields...  ""reap oasts,"" he murmured. ""it might be stealing, but it's the quickest and easiest way to get gold."""	1

a man invites some of his fetish club over for breakfast.... they are catching up on life and swapping stories about work, their grandkidsâ birthdays, their recent stock market fortunes, and so on, when the subject of what theyâre most proud of comes up.  gerald, a 35 year old dentist, proudly exclaims, âof everyone here, i by far, have the largest penis.â  no one argued with gerald as everyone at the table had seen (or felt) his penis and it was massive.  it didnât matter what room he was in. he probably had the largest penis in it.  craig, a 26 year old dj, casually said, âwell i have massive fists.â  everyone nodded silently.  craigâs fists were well known and had been in many orifices.  he has been known to turn the smallest babbling brook into a vast canyon.  agnes, a 91 year old retired welder, proudly said, âwell i have the nicest vagina in the room.â  again, no one argued with agnes.  for one, she was the only woman in the room. and for two, despite being 91, she was in good shape and took care of herself to include vagina exercises.  tim, a 21 year old nurse, and the host of the gathering, smirked and exclaimed, âwell i have the biggest asshole here!â  immediately the group started to murmur amongst itself.  they had all been sticking things up their butt for many years (especially agnes) and there was no way the youngest of the group had the biggest asshole.  craig immediately stepped up to the challenge.  he had been working on a party trick for a while now and this seemed like the appropriate time to show it.  he went to the fridge and found an 8â carrot.  he then took his pants off, laid down on his stomach and flipped the carrot over his shoulder.  it flew in a wide ark and immediately disappeared up his butt.  the group gave a golf clap.  the showmanship was impressive but it didnât answer the question at hand.  gerald decided it was his time to shine.  he went to the pantry and found a potato.  he then placed the potato on the counter, took his pants off and sat on the potato.  just to show he didnât damage the potato he took it out and showed the group.  it looked exactly like it had before it had gone in (maybe a little browner).  the group was slightly more impressed by this.  butt stuff was geraldâs thing though, so it was expected heâd have something to offer.  now it was time for agnes to show all these young amateurs what was up.  she went into the garage and found a 2 foot long, 2 inch thick wooden dowel.  she lifted up her dress and balanced on top of the dowel.  she then took a deep breathe and dropped to the floor.  when she stood back up the dowel was gone.  this was truly impressive, but to be fair, this is a *largest* asshole contest, not a *longest* asshole contest.  still smirking, tim walked into the kitchen and turned on his espresso machine.  he steamed the milk and whipped it.  he poured in the espresso and added a swirl of caramel and just a touch of cinnamon.  he put a doily on a saucer and plated his drink.  he casually walked over to the table and placed his drink onto it.  just as he did a giant fat tabby cat came barreling into the room, sliding around on the floor, and slamming into walls as he turned corners.  he jump onto the table and immediately swatted the drink off.  the cup and saucer shattered and there was liquid everywhere.  the cat then peed on the table and tried to scratch tim.  agnes, gerald, and craig immediately realized the misunderstanding that has happened.  an embarrassing quiet fell over the room.  gerald finally broke the silence, âso your cat is the biggest asshole.â  then he thinks for a second and goes, âdoes he hate all coffee or just the fancy stuff?â  tim looks a little confused and says, âitâs just the fancy stuff.  but the catâs not the biggest asshole.  the coffee is just how i get him into the room.â  tim then shoves the cat up his ass.	1

"a man has a habit of starting every morning by breaking wind. of course, his wife finds this habit disgusting, and even as she asks him to stop, he only snickers, continuing the habit every morning.  after one of the husband's daily bouts of morning flatulence, the woman tells him that if  he continues to fart every morning, his intestines will come out of his ass. of course, he does not believe her claim, and he gets up, as every day before. enraged, the woman thinks of a solution.  later that day, the woman saves the intestines from the turkey that she has cooked, preparing to give her husband a proper scare. when he's fallen asleep, she puts the turkey intestines in his underwear, and when he wakes up, after delivering his usual sour flatuosity, he is horrified to feel what he presumes to be his own innards in his underwear.  as the man rushes to the bathroom, holding his behind all the way, his wife smiles content, asking: ""i told you that would happen!""  as she hears a grunt and a slopping sound, her husband comes out of the bathroom, a satisfied grin on his face. ""yes,"" he says, ""but thanks to god's grace and these two fingers, all is back where it should be."""	1

"a king was growing jealous of his new born ever since his son was born, the king felt like everyone was paying more attention to his son than him. as days passed he was starting to get more and more jealous of his son for getting all the love and was starting to feel a pain growing in him knowing that he wasn't the center of the attention anymore. he even felt like the queen was starting to ignore him and was spending more time with their son.  unable to bear the pain, the king decided that he didn't need a son like that. he asked the handmaid to discretely apply poison to the queen's nipples before she nurses the child that day. then he left for hunting not wanting to be present at the palace when it happens. after an hour he returned back to the palace to find everyone with a sad face. not wanting to look suspicious, the king put up a concerned face and asks a teared up chamberlain what was going on:  ""why does everyone have a sad face? what happened while i was gone that has this place mourning?""  ""i am afraid i have a very terrible news your majesty... we found the...c..co...""  unable to convey the news fully, the chamberlain takes a moment to compose himself before continuing ""we heard the queen scream a few minutes ago so all of us rushed to see what happened, and that's where we found him dead""  the king puts on a very anxious face accordingly and asks in a shaky voice: ""what? what happened? how did this happen?""  ""we are not sure yet your majesty, we found him dead in your bedroom with a lot of foam from his mouth around a few minutes ago . we have asked the physician to come and take a look at what happened to determine the cause. this is very unexpected as he seemed very healthy and was meant to live much longer. i am very sorry for your loss, your majesty. he was definitely one of a kind courtier.""  edit: grammar"	1

"a joke my religion professor told me... a dutch calvinist gets stranded on a deserted island...  he saved his bible in the shipwreck, so he maintained a prayerful life despite being stranded.  the island was full of fruit and wildlife that he could hunt, so he survived well.  every day he swims out to a channel to see if any ships would pass through.  day after day, for several years, he continued this routine.  one day, when swimming out to the channel, he sees a ship.  he calls out to them, and they rescue him!  he is brought to the captain who marvels at his story of survival.  he asks the captain ""can i go back to the island to retrieve my belongings?  some of my things are very important to me.""  the captain agrees and sends two crew members with him on a rowboat.  they ask him questions about his survival, eagerly hearing how this man bested the wild for all these years.  approaching his living area, the crew members see three huts.  *one man with three huts*, they wonder, *what could he possibly do with them?*  ""what is that leftmost hut used for?"" asked a crew member.  ""that's my house, where i ate and slept,"" answered the calvinist.  that made sense.  ""what is that middle hut used for?"" he followed up.  ""that is my church, where i go to pray, read scripture, and worship god, who has kept me alive for all these years,"" answered the devout calvinist.  that also made sense.  but what could the last hut be for?  ""what is the rightmost hut used for?"" asked the crew member.  the calvinist answered, ""oh, that's where i used to go to church."""	1

a magician was working on a cruise ship in the caribbean.  the audience was different each week so he did the same tricks over and over. the problem was, the captain's parrot saw all the shows and began to understand how the magician did every trick.  he started shouting in the middle of the show: 'look, it's not the same hat. look, he's hiding the flowers under the table. hey, why are all the cards the ace of spades?' the magician was furious but, as it was the captain's parrot, he could do nothing. then one day the ship sank and the magician found himself floating on a piece of wood with the parrot.  they glared at each other but said nothing. finally, after a week, the parrot said: 'ok, i give up. where's the boat?'	1

the cheapskate painter  a painter named jack always tried to save a buck whenever he  could, so he often would thin down his paint to make it go a wee bit  further. he somehow managed to get away with this for some time.  one day, the local church decided to do a big restoration project.  jack put in a painting bid and because his price was so competitive, he got the job.  he erected the trestles. put up the planks, and started thinning down the paint with turpentine.  as jack was up on the scaffolding painting away, there was a horrendous clap of thunder. the sky opened and the rain poured down,  washing the thin paint from all over the church and knocking jack off  the scaffold to land on the lawn.  jack was no fool. he knew this was a judgment from the almighty, so he fell on his knees and cried, âoh, god! forgive me! what should i do?â  and from the thunder, a mighty voice spoke, ârepaint! repaint! and thin no more!â	1

a child from a poor family wanted a bike for christmas so he asked his mother. his mother replied, 'well, i can't afford one so you'll just have to go ask the baby jesus.'  the boy went to his room, got a stack of refill and a pen and began writing: 'dear baby jesus, i've been good all year, can you please give me a bike for christmas.'  then he looked at it and thought maybe that wasn't entirely true, so he tried again.  'dear baby jesus, i've been good for the past week, can you please give me a bike for christmas.'  then he looked at it again and still wasn't sure if that was true, so he tried yet again.  'dear baby jesus, if you give me a bike, i'll be good all year.'  but even then that seemed too hard, so he took a walk outside to think about it.  as he was walking, he saw his neighbour's statue of mother mary. the boy hopped over the fence, tucked it under his shoulder and ran home to hide it.  then wrote his letter again.  'dear baby jesus, if you ever want to see your mother again, give me a bike.'	1

""wait here,"" he says. the cop calls for backup. soon cops, cars, and helicopters are flooding the area. the man is cuffed quickly and taken towards a car.  however, before he gets in, a cop walks up to him and says, while gesturing to the cop that pulled him over, ""sir, this officer informed us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. however, we found none of these things in your car.""  the man replies, ""yeah, and i bet that liar said i was speeding too!"""	1

""certainly"", replied the chairman. ""i bet you Â£25,000 that my testicles are not square.""  ""done"", the elderly woman answered. ""but given the amount of money involved, if you don't mind i would like to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning with my lawyer as a witness."" ""no problem"", said the chairman of the bank confidently.   that night, the chairman became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror examining his testicles, turning them this way and that, checking them over again and again until he was positive that no one could consider his testicles as square and reassuring himself that there was no way he could lose the bet.  the next morning at exactly 10 o'clock the elderly woman arrived at the chairman's office with her lawyer and acknowledged the Â£25,000 bet made the day before that the chairman's testicles were square.  the chairman confirmed that the bet was the same as the one made the day before. then the elderly woman asked him to drop his trousers etc. so that she and her lawyer could see clearly.  the chairman was happy to oblige.  the elderly woman came closer so she could see better and asked the chairman if she could touch them. ""of course"", said the chairman. ""given the amount of money involved, you should be 100% sure.""  the elderly woman did so with a little smile.  suddenly the chairman noticed that the lawyer was banging his head against the wall. he asked the elderly woman why he was doing that and she replied, ""oh, it's probably because i bet him Â£100,000 that around 10 o'clock in the morning i would be holding the balls of the chairman of the bank of england !"""	1

barry's job was to write articles for a massive online news site run by the mafia... he absolutely hated his job, but he had to stay because they would kill his family if he left. he had to write articles about the mafiaâs crimes, and because the company had all the lawmakers bribed, they were untouchable even though they openly admitted to their crimes.       the editor-in-chief walked over to his desk one day, and leaned on the side of his cubicle.       he said, âbarry, weâve got the senatorâs daughter held hostage. thing is, we canât do our usual schtick and demand money because we think the feds are onto us. gimme something good for the headline and weâll let you off early.â       so barry, knowing exactly what was at stake, wrote the standard ransom article asking for fifty million dollars, but this time he changed the title:  âsenatorâs daughter to be released safely only upon reception of $50 million in precious metalsâ.       barry felt very proud of himself, and sure enough a week later the ransom had been paid and the company was rich. the editor-in-chief came back to his desk.       âgreat job, barry! it worked! why donât you take the rest of the day off,  after you change the title so the feds canât hold it against us?â       barry agreed, and within five minutes the article title read:        âedit: thanks for gold!â	1

"a man is about to go to a stag party with his friends. before he heads off, his girlfriend of 3 years tells him ""you've had a history of getting stupidly drunk and leaving me to babysit you every time you come back on nights out like these. if you come back to our house drunk like that tonight, we're through.""  the man agrees with her, and heads out to meet his friends.  however, during the course of the evening, one thing leads to another, and the man gets drunk to the point where he vomits all over his shoes and shirt. crying, he sobs to his friend that ""this is it for him and his girlfriend.""   his friend pauses, and says ""show her some money to her and tell her that another guy got drunk, was sick on you and then handed you money as an apology.""  so the man comes back home, sobered up but still smelling of vomit. just as his girlfriend is about to berate him, he pulls out a Â£10, telling her that another guy got drunk that night and was sick all over him. she says that she was glad he didn't get stupidly drunk this time.  the man pulls out another Â£10 note, and says ""this one's from a guy who shit in my pants."""	1

"a chemistry professor posted a bonus question to an exam:    is hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?  most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using boyle's law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.  one student, however, wrote the following:  first, we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time. so we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into hell and the rate at which they are leaving. i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. therefore, no souls are leaving.  as for how many souls are entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to hell.  with birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because boyle's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the volume of hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.  this gives two possibilities:  1. if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose.  2. if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over.  so which is it?  if we accept the postulate given to me by teresa during my freshman year that, ""it will be a cold day in hell before i go out with you"", and take into account the fact that i went out with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus i am sure that hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.  the corollary of this theory is that since hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore extinct . . . leaving only heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being, which explains why last night teresa kept shouting ""oh, my god!""  this student received the only ""a""."	1

in 1986, peter davies was on holiday in kenya after graduating from louisiana state university on a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. the elephant seemed distressed, so peter approached it very carefully. he got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. as carefully and as gently as he could, peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.  the elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.  twenty years later, peter was walking through the chicago zoo with his teenaged son. as they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where peter and his son cameron were standing. the large bull elephant stared at peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. the elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.  remembering the encounter in 1986, peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. he walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. the elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.  probably wasn't the same elephant.	1

a farmer stopped by the local mechanics shop... to have his truck fixed. they couldnât do it while he waited, so he said he didnât live far and would just walk home.  on the way home he stopped at the hardware store and bought a bucket and a gallon of paint. he then stopped by the feed store and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. however, struggling outside the store he now had a problem â how to carry his entire purchases home.  while he was scratching his head he was approached by a little old lady who told him she was lost. she asked, âcan you tell me how to get to 1603 mockingbird lane ?â the farmer said, âwell, as a matter of fact, my farm is very close to that house i would walk you there but i canât carry this lot.â the old lady suggested, âwhy donât you put the can of paint in the bucket. carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?â âwhy thank you very much,â he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home.  on the way he says âletâs take my short cut and go down this alley. weâll be there in no time..  â the little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, âi am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me.. how do i know that when we get in the alley you wonât hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?â  the farmer said, âholy smokes lady! iâm carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens, and a goose. how in the world could i possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?â  the old lady replied, âset the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the paint on top of the bucket, and iâll hold the chickens.	1

"an explorer spent weeks scouring the jungles of skull island, hoping to see the legendary king kong. one day, when he was all but certain that it was nothing but a myth, he came to a clearing - and right there before him, sitting pensively, was the imposing figure of king kong... the explorer glared at king kong in awe, and approached him slowly. king kong seemed to be quite passive, so the explorer slowly reached out and shyly touched him. but as soon as he made contact with the gorillaâs fur, king kong went berserk. he immediately rose to his feet, began beating his chest and roared mightily.  as the explorer ran for his life, king kong set off in hot pursuit. instinctively the explorer headed for the heart of the jungle, hoping that he might be able to hide from his manic pursuer, but wherever he tried to conceal himself, king kong always managed to find him.  as night began to fall, the explorer prayed that he would be able to lose the gorilla in the darkness but no matter how fast he ran, the sound of king kongâs pounding footsteps was just behind him.  for three long days and nights, the explorer ran through the island, with king kong always close behind, occasionally letting out a menacing roar from his vast throat. eventually the explorer reached the coast. there were no ships in sight for an easy escape, so he realized the only option was to dive into the sea and hope that king kong couldnât swim. but to his horror, the gorilla jumped in straight after him and demonstrated an excellent front crawl.  on and on they swam across the ocean, rarely separated by more than a few waves, until four months later the weary explorer arrived in brazil. he scrambled ashore with as much energy as he could muster, only to see the mighty king kong right behind him, still beating his chest ferociously and with steam billowing from his nostrils. through the streets of rio they stumbled, explorer and ape equally exhausted, until the explorer took a wrong turn and ended up down a dead end, his escape barred by a huge wall.  with nowhere left to run, he sank to his knees in despair and pleaded to king kong: ""do whatever you want with me. kill me, eat me, do what you like, but make it quick. i can't run anymore!""  king kong slowly stalked over to the cowering explorer, extended his giant paw, then gently touched the man and roared: âtag, you're it!"""	1

""i recall that,"" said henry. ""and you did it to save my life, so of course i can forgive you for that.  now tell me about the third time.""   ""all right,"" betty said.

"the lookout researchers for the massachusetts turnpike authority found over 200 dead crows recently, and there was concern that they may have died from avian flu. a bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely not avian flu. the cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.   however, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. by analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.   mta then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. the ornithological behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. they discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""cah"", not a single one could shout ""truck."""	1

""why are the buildings shining like that?"", he asked.  ""didn't they brief you about the colony?"", the driver asked ""we don't call it anti-earth just because, it's literally the opposite of earth. any element rare on earth is as common as carbon(c) here, and interestingly carbon(c) doesn't occur naturally here. so we had to make good of what we had, the buildings are made of rare metals like radium(ra) which glow in the dark.""  after half an hour they arrived at what seemed the main highway, the road had a faint bluish glow and the sides were lined with metallic posts shining faintly in the double moonlight. they stopped near a small dilapidated shack with the words ""communication office"" crudely etched on the walls.   ""this is your office. you are supposed to handle communications for the colony,"" the driver said. ""we can't use any wireless communication as the high amount of radioactive gases in the atmosphere interferes with the signal, so we have to use a type of telegraph instead. come on, i'll show you our most important resource.""  they walked a bit till they reached a plantation full of bizarre trees. some were made of precious metals, some of common earth metals and some of them were glowing radioactively.  ""this is the plantation for building the posts. we brought these seeds from earth and planted them, apparently as they couldn't get the conventional elements they just used what the soil contained. we just sell the gold(au), silver(ag) and platinum(pt) trees to earth, the iron(fe) and aluminium(al) are used for constructing equipment and there are some pretty rare elements like uranium(u) and astatine(at) (which is the rarest element on earth) which are used for scientific research. however, these aren't what we are here for.""   the driver motioned him to follow him towards a small area of trees with a silvery sheen to them.  ""these are made of rhenium(re) one of the densest elements with one of the highest melting and boiling points. it is strong enough to withstand the toxic atmosphere and radioactivity of this planet. so we use it to make the telegraph posts. as you may have noticed we have lined almost the whole road with telegraph lines.""

""that's right. well, i guess you can take one of my calves,"" says bud. he watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.   then bud says to the young man, ""if i can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?""   the young man thinks about it for a second and then says, ""okay, why not?""   ""you're a congressman for the u.s. government"", says bud.   ""wow! that's correct,"" says the yuppie, ""but how did you guess that?""   ""no guessing required."" answered the cowboy. ""you showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer i already knew, to a question i never asked. you used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.    this is a herd of sheep. .....    now give me back my dog."	1

[nsfw] joke i found in a vintage porno from the 1930's. so this is a simple time where men are men and women are women.  tommy is on a date with stacy and takes a long detour 10 miles outside of town. he propositions her for sex, and if she doesn't put out she can walk home.  stacy walks home.  a second date happens as tommy proceeds to drive 20 miles outside of town. he propositions stacy with the same offer of put out, or walk home.   stacy walks home.  a 3rd date happens, in which tommy drives 50 miles outside of town. he again propositions stacy to put out or walk home. to his surprise she accepts and they have sex.   on the long drive back to town, tommy asks stacy why she just didn't put out and have sex. as it would have saved so much time and energy.  thats when stacy says.  you see... i will walk 10 miles, i will even walk 20 miles... but i will not walk 50 miles to save someone from get the clap.	1

"one misty scottish morning a man is driving through the hills to inverness. suddenly out of the mist, a massive red-haired highlander steps into the middle of the road. the man is at least six feet four, has a huge red beard and, despite the wind, mist, and near freezing temperatures, is wearing only his kilt, a tweed shirt and a tam-o'-shanter at a rakish angle.  at the roadside there also stands a young woman. she is absolutely beautiful slim, shapely, fair complexion, golden hair... heart stopping. the driver stops and stares, and his attention is only distracted from the lovely girl when the red thing opens the car door and drags him from his seat onto the road with a fist resembling a whole raw ham.  ""right, you jimmy"" he shouts ""ah want you to masturbate!"" ""but..."" stammers the driver. ""du it now!! or i'll bluddy kill yu!"" so the driver turns his back on the girl, drops his trousers and starts to masturbate. thinking of the girl on the roadside, this doesn't take him long.  ""right!"" snarls the highlander. ""'du it agin, now!"" so the driver does it again. ""right laddie, du it agin!"" demands the highlander. this goes on for nearly two hours. the hapless driver gets cramps in both arms, he has rubbed himself raw, is violently aching, his sight is failing and despite the cold wind, he has collapsed in a sweating, jibbering heap on the ground, unable to stand.  ""du it again!"" says the highlander. ""i can't do it anymore! you'll just have to kill me!"" whimpers the man. the highlander looks down at the pathetic soul slumped on the roadside and says ""all right laddie. now, can you give ma daughter a lift to inverness?"""	1

a television network recently launched a new game show called âcrack the jokeâ in the show, the host will read jokes to the player, and the player must guess the punchline before the host reaches it. if the player successfully âcrack the jokeâ, he can then choose to either take whatever he already won and leave, or proceed to the next joke. there are 10 jokes to be cracked for each player, and the grand prize is $30,000 for who cracks them all.  3 players were invited to the very first episode of the show. with a big round of applause came the first player, a fabulous looking elderly lady. the host asked her to introduce herself, so she did: âhello everyone, my name is lucy and iâm from sydney. iâm 74 years old. i have a bunch of cheerful friends who loves telling each other jokes. i have heard quite a lot during my 60 years friendship with them, and that would help me with todayâs challenge.â the host wished her luck and started reading.   lucy certainly wasnât unfamiliar with the jokes, but her age was dragging her down. she eventually failed to crack the 4th joke despite of it being âso familiar, iâve definitely heard this one somewhereâ. the host regretfully announced her defeat.  the second player was a sharp looking man with a business suit. he introduced himself without the host have to ask: âmorning lovely people. my name is bob jassen. iâm a car salesman. i like talking to my customers, and i use jokes as ice breakers. i collect jokes whenever i see them so i never run out of material.â the host wished him luck and started reading.  bob has an excellent mind and knows many jokes. without too much trouble he was already at his 6th joke. but he hadnât heard this one before. he took a wild guess and got lucky. he decided to take the safer route, so he grabbed his $2,500 prize money and left.  and from the backstage came the last player of the night. he was an average looking man with t-shirt, jeans and a pair of glasses. he was sitting there, visibly nervous, when the host asked him to do the introduction. he said: âhi, iâm u/jimraynor0. iâm a programmer.â the host had to ask: âa programmer eh? and what makes you think youâre good at cracking jokes?â to which jim replied: âi read r/jokes almost everyday.â   the host thought jim was not very interesting. without further conversation he started the game: âa lumberjack went into a magic forest to cut...â  jim interrupted him mid-sentence and answered correctly: âand youâll dialogue.â  the host confirmed that jim wish to continue, then proceed to read the 2nd joke: âa couple went to a sex therapistâs clinic. the doctor asked: âwhat can i help you with?â and the man asked: âcan you watch us having sex?ââ  and it was then jim interrupted again: âyou only charge $50 if we do it here, and we get $43 back from medicare.â once again he was correct.  the game continues. âa young kid goes to a big department store looking for a job. the manager asked: âdo you have any sales experience?ââ  âyour weekend is ruined, you might as well go fishing.â said jim.  âa man got on a bus and sat next to a beautiful nun...â  âiâm the bus driver.â  âan 18 years old italian girl...â  âyou fuck her again.â  âdave bragged...â  âwhoâs the guy standing next to dave at the balcony?â  jim seemed unstoppable. as he cracked more jokes he picked up confidence as well, answering even before the host can finish the first sentence. not long had passed before he got to his last joke. the host looked at his hand, thereâs only one joke card left. it was a pun, and it seems quite obvious. âwell, nothing can stop him now.â the host thought to himself, and proceed to read the joke: âhave you heard that the police stormed a touring circus and found the secret stash of their scamming magician?â  he was expected to be interrupted again, but no. this time jim just sat in silence, with a face of agony and frustration. the host, still in total disbelief, finished the joke: âit was intense.â and with that he claimed jim failed to crack the joke and earned nothing.  before jim could go, the host asked him: âhow did you missed the last joke? it wasnât even a clever pun.â with a defeated look on his face, jim said: âyou see, your joke is a regional con tent. thatâs sth i never see on r/jokes.â	1

"the pastor asked if anyone in the congregation would like to express praise for answered prayers.  a lady stood and walked to the podium.  she said, ""i have a praise. two months ago, my husband tom had a terrible bicycle wreck, and his scrotum was completely crushed. the pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him.""  you could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagined the pain that tom must have experienced.  ""tom was unable to hold me or the children,"" she went on, ""and every move caused him terrible pain. we prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of tom's scrotum and wrap wire around it to hold it in place.""  again the men in the congregation were unnerved and squirmed uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on tom.  ""now,"" she announced in a quavering voice, ""thank the lord tom is out of the hospital, and the doctors say that with time his scrotum should recover completely.""  all the men sighed with relief. the pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.  a man stood up and walked slowly to the podium.   he said ""i'm tom."" the entire congregation held its breath..   ""i just want to tell my wife that the word is sternum."""	1

the joke my great-grandpa told me about 15 years ago a man kisses his wife goodnight and goes to sleep one day. after he wakes up, he notices an old man in white robes lying next to him instead of his wife.   - who are you and why are you in my bed?! - he asks.   - this is not your bedroom. i am st peter and you're in heaven.   - what?! i'm dead? it can't be! bring me back to earth, now!   - it's not that easy. you can either come back as a chicken, or a dog.   the man thinks about it and figures that a chicken's life is more calm then dog's life.   - bring me back as a dog. - exclaims the man.      suddenly, the man appears as a chicken on a farm. another chicken approaches him and says:   - you must be the new chicken that st peter told me about.   - oh yes that's me.   - so, how do you like being a chicken?   - well, i feel like my rump is going to explode!   the other chicken shrugs with his wings and says:   - you got to lay an egg to get some relief.   - and how am i supposed to do that?!   - cackle two times and then push as hard as you can.      the man-chicken cackles and pushes as hard as he can.   - wow, that was great! i want to lay some more eggs!   and he pushes, and lays another one, and another. suddenly, he hears his wife screaming:   - john, wake up! you have shat all over the bed!	1

an american investment banker...[long] an american investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked.Â Â inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna.Â Â the american complimented the mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.  the mexican replied, âonly a little while. the american then asked why didnât he stay out longer and catch more fish? the mexican said he had enough to support his familyâs immediate needs. the american then asked, âbut what do you do with the rest of your time?â  the mexican fisherman said, âi sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, maria, stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos.Â Â i have a full and busy life.â the american scoffed, âi am a harvard mba and could help you. you should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. with the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. you would control the product, processing, and distribution. you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city, then la and eventually new york city, where you will run your expanding enterprise.â  the mexican fisherman asked, âbut, how long will this all take?â  to which the american replied, â15 â 20 years.â  âbut what then?â asked the mexican.  the american laughed and said, âthatâs the best part.Â Â when the time is right you would announce an ipo and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!â  âmillions â then what?â  the american said, âthen you would retire.Â Â move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.â	1

if the great war was a bar fight germany, austria and italy are standing together in the middle of a pub when serbia bumps into austria and spills austria's pint. austria demands serbia buy it a complete new suit because there are splashes on its trouser leg. germany expresses its support for austria's point of view. britain recommends that everyone calm down a bit. serbia points out that it can't afford a whole suit, but offers to pay for the cleaning of austria's trousers. russia and serbia look at austria. austria asks serbia who it's looking at. russia suggests that austria should leave its little brother alone. austria inquires as to whose army will assist russia in compelling it to do so.   germany complains to britain that france has been staring at it, and that this is sufficiently out of order that britain should not intervene. britain replies that france can look at who it wants to, that britain is looking at germany too, and what is germany going to do about it? germany tells russia to stop staring at austria, or germany will render russia incapable of such action. britain and france ask germany whether it's eying belgium.  turkey and germany go off into a corner and whisper. when they come back, turkey makes a show of not looking at anyone. germany rolls up its sleeves, looks at france, and punches belgium. france and britain punch germany. austria punches russia. germany punches britain and france with one hand and russia with the other. russia throws a punch at germany, but misses and nearly falls over. japan calls over from the other side of the room that it's on britain's side, but stays there. italy surprises everyone by punching austria. australia punches turkey and gets punched back. there are no hard feelings because britain made australia do it. france gets thrown through a plate-glass window, but gets back up and carries on fighting. russia gets thrown through another one, gets knocked out, suffers brain damage, and wakes up with a complete personality change. italy throws a punch at austria and misses, but austria falls over anyway. italy raises both fists in the air and runs round the room chanting.   america waits till germany is about to fall over from sustained punching from britain and france, then walks over and smashes it with a barstool, then pretends it won the fight all by itself. by now all the chairs are broken and the big mirror over the bar is shattered. britain, france, and america agree that germany threw the first punch, so the whole thing is germany's fault. while germany is still unconscious, they go through its pockets, steal its wallet, and buy drinks for all their friends.	1

"i made a (hopefully) original joke! in 2019, the army had been at war with another country. in order to keep their troops healthy, they needed to monitor the submarine that carried supplies to where the others were located.  but there was a small problem. every so often, there would be a defect in the submarine's engine that would cause it to shut down. these defects were manageable at first, but they slowly became so severe that the crew had no choice but to get several ships to surround the submarine and make sure it was functioning properly.  each ship had a small selection of sailors posted on the end of the ship, and their jobs were to watch the submarine for any problems. if they found any, they were to report to the aiding crew that would repair the ship's engine and keep it alive.  but there was a problem. despite sailors being required to sit around and do nothing all day, they were hardly being paid. and this inspired a strike! the sailors eventually all abandoned their posts, meaning there was nobody watching over the submarine.  the military leader was confused by the complaints he was hearing and decided to investigate for himself. he went on the security cameras and went to ship 1, but nobody was there.  he checked ship 2, and nobody was there.  he checked ship 3, and nobody was there!  panicking, the leader called the ship's aiding crew and screamed ""is this sub still active?! i haven't seen any posts since last deck, aid!"""	1

fear has kept more brilliant people from greatness than anything else in the history of the world i'm not sure if it's society, upbringing, constant negative self-talk, or a combination of these and more, but it seems like fear has kept more brilliant and tremendous people from living the life of greatness they are capable of more than anything else in the world. fear of taking a risk, fear of change, fear of failure, fear of success. if we could just figure out a way to push through our fear and move onward and upward even with the fear, i think we'd see more people live successful, vibrant, healthy lives.	1

""your partner must say '1-2-3-4,'"" the medicine man responded, ""but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon.""       the man was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. when she came in, he quickly took off his clothes and said, ""1-2-3!"" immediately, he was the manliest of men. his wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes as she asked ""what was the 1-2-3 for?""        and that, boys and girls, is why we should never end our sentences with a preposition, because we could end up with a dangling participle.  #repost  all credits to whoever came up with this joke. i hope you are doing fine. it make me laugh every once in a while."	1

'what's the morale of that story?' asked the teacher.   'don't put all your eggs in one basket!'   'very good,' said the teacher.   next little sarah raised her hand and said, 'our family are farmers too. but we raise chickens for the meat market. one day we had a dozen eggs, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks, and the moral to this story is, 'don't count your chickens before they're hatched'.'   'that was a fine story sarah.'   johnny, do you have a story to share?'   'yes. my daddy told me this story about my auntie barbara. auntie barbara was a flight engineer on a plane in the gulf war and her plane got hit.   she had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whisky, a machine gun and a machete.   she drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then she landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops.   she killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she   ran out of bullets.   then she killed twenty more with the machete until the blade broke.   and then she killed the last ten with her bare hands.'

""well, ""he explained, ""the restaurantâs owners hired andersen consulting to revamp all our processes. after several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery. it represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. if our staff are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift.""  as luck would have it, i dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. ""iâll get another spoon next time i go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now."" i was impressed.  i also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiterâs zip on his trousers. looking around, i noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. so before he walked off, i asked the waiter, ""excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?""  ""oh, certainly!"" then he lowered his voice. ""not everyone is so observant. that consulting firm i mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest-room. by tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the rest-room by 76.39 per cent.""  i asked ""after you get it out, how do you put it back?""  ""well,"" he whispered, ""i donât know about the others, but i use the spoon."""	1

""oh. i guess so. a little maybe."" replies the blond relaxing again.   some time passes and the masseur takes things a little further. he begins groping her ass. she reacts slightly, but he says, ""you have a bad knot in your glutes too. let me work it out for you."" the woman again relaxes.   he turns her face up and starts rubbing lotion on her chest. she blushes but says nothing. he goes further, plainly fondling her breasts. she has no reaction at all.   emboldened, he gently parts her legs and slips a finger into her privates. he unzips his pants intently watching for her reaction. the blond just lays there watching him as he proceeds to make love to her.   afterward, as the blond woman is settling the bill with the receptionist, she asks if she'd had any concerns that the masseur had neglected to address.  ""none at all."" replies the blond. ""i got a full body massage, a breast exam, a pelvic, and he even gave me something for my herpes."""	1

a scotsman, an englishman and a frenchman are walking through the jungle... theyâre very tired, and they decide to take a shortcut across a nearby river to quickly reach  their camp.   as they cross the river, a tribe of savages charge out of the trees and surround them. the tribe chief steps forward and says  âthis river sacred ground... you trespass on sacred ground! now, as punishment, you die.â  the chief goes on to explain that after they kill them, the tribe will use their skin to make canoes. they will then sail these canoes on the river as a warning to future trespassers.   however, (as he is a kind leader) the chief decides that although the three men  must die, they may choose how they die and even do it themselves if they wish. the three men agree, and the englishman goes first  âi would like a gun, pleaseâ  the chief hands him a gun. the englishman thanks him, shouts âgod save the queen!â and blows his own brains out. the tribe drag his corpse away to turn into a canoe. the frenchman goes next  âi would like some poison, si vous plaitâ  the chief hands him some poison. the frenchman thanks him, shouts âviva la france!â and drinks it. he instantly dies, and the tribe drag his corpse away to turn into a canoe. finally, itâs the scotsmanâs turn   âi want a forkâ  the chief is very confused, but nevertheless hands him a fork. the scotsman thanks the chief, before beginning to frantically stab himself all over his body. his arms, legs, face, chest, back, anywhere he can reach. after a good thirty seconds, he finally drops the fork, blood now gushing from the hundreds of tiny holes across his body.  âthere goes yer canoe ya fat c*ntâ	1

"". the panelists were awestruck. they asked the student to send in the dumb one after him. but, being his best friend, he told his dumb friend everything that was asked in the interview and also told him exactly what to answer. the student went in and the panelist started asking him questions. first, they asked him ""when were you born ?"". he replied in a very confident voice ""sir, the struggle started way back in 1943 but finally it happened in 1947"". the panelists were shocked and couldn't hold their laughter. next, they asked, ""what is your father's name ?"". being confident he answered in a very fluent way ""sorry sir, but i should not name only a single one because it will be disrespectful for the others who all fought for the cause""."	1

""blackie, is that you?""    the dog spoke.   ""yes it's me, i am sorry that i that i left you. but i desperately need your help. i went to heaven after i died, but they won't let me in. god said that he can't let dogs into heaven if they don't have their tails, but since i was a good dog he let me come back for tonight to retrieve it. i know you still have mine and i need it back if i am ever to rest peacefully.""   the man replied,   ""i'm sorry blackie, but you know i can't retail spirits after midnight."""	1

a joke my friend told me when we were in grade 5. 100 of the ugliest people on a bus, they crash and are all sent to heaven. the angel there felt very sorry for all of them and decides to send them back all with one wish each. the first victim steps up.  âi wish to be the most beautiful person in the world.â  and with a wave of the angels hand they became absolutely beautiful. they get sent back and the second person goes up.   âi want to be the most beautiful person in the world!â  the angel stops, âthe previous person said that, so iâll make you the second beautifulest then.â  with a wave of their hand the victim transformed and was sent down.  it was at this time the person at the back started laughing to themselves. they were asked what he was laughing about but he kept it to himself.  and so the line shrunk. âi want to be the 21st beautifulest person in the world.â  the guy at the end was laughing loudly now.  âi want to be the 51st beautifulest person in the world.â  he started rolling on the floor as he laughed.  âi want to be the 75th beautifulest person in the world.â  the guy at the end was loudly gasping for air as he laughed harder and harder.  âi want to be the 99th beautifulest person in the world.â  finally, as the last man wipes tears from his eyes struggling to breath, he walks up to the angel who was very curious.  âwhy were you laughing all this time sir?â  âi wish they were all ugly again.â	1

""is that when you swore?"" ""no, father."" said the man. ""after that, a squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in his mouth and began to run away."" ""is that when you swore?"" asked the father again. ""well, no."" said the man, ""you see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!""  ""is that when you swore?"" asked the amazed priest. ""no, not yet."" the man replied. ""as the eagle carried the squirrel away in his claws, it flew towards the green.  and as it passed over a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball."" ""did you swear then?"" asked the now impatient priest. ""no, because as the ball fell it struck a tree, bounced through some bushes, careened off a big rock, and rolled through a sand trap onto the green and stopped within six inches of the hole.""  ""you missed the putt, didn't you?"" sighed the priest."	1

"a man crosses the border each morning on a donkey... ...and each day, his donkey is loaded with only bags of straw. when he reaches the bridge marking the border, the tax collectors search his bags to calculate what duty he must pay on his exports. every day, they find nothing. and yet, in the evening, after their shift has finished and they are in the tea houses or restaurants in the city, they see the same man spending lots of money and boasting that he is in fact a smuggler and that no one can catch him.   every day, incensed at his bold claims, the tax collectors obsessively search his bags of straw. they sift the straw, cut it into pieces, rip open the fabric of his bags, attempt to burn the straw, check his hat, his beard and even cut open his shoes in the hope of finding coins between the leather. and yet, each evening, he is seen back in the city growing ever more prosperous and ever more brazen, even offering to pay for the tax collectors meals and drinks while continuing to tell stories of his wily smuggling. the tax collectors continue their futile interrogations of the straw bags for years, to no avail.  this continues until, now a prosperous man, the smuggler moves away to another city and settles down to enjoy his wealth. years pass and one day, in the market, one of the retired tax collectors meets his old foe and asks,  'mister, many years have passed: i am no longer a tax collector and we are just two old men. please, you can tell me, what was it you were smuggling all that time?'  the smuggler replied, 'donkeys.'  &#x200b;  \\[adapted from a mulla nasruddin tale\\]"	1

"researchers for the massachusetts turnpike authority found over 200 dead crows near greater boston recently... researchers for the massachusetts turnpike authority found over 200 dead crows near greater boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from avian flu.  a bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely not avian flu.  the cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.  however, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws.  by analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.   mta then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.   the ornithological behaviorist very quickly determined the cause:  when crows eat road kill, they always have a lookout crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.  they discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""cah"", not a single one could shout ""truck."""	1

""you wanted to see me?"" asks quincy.  ""yes,"" the ceo replies, ""i cannot allow you to continue to work here, i'm afraid. you have committed one of the most serious violations of our company policy.""  quincy shifts nervously in his seat, he knows what is coming.

a time traveler comes back from the year 2045 i encountered a time traveler today.  during my self isolation he came to the door dressed in a hazmat suit.  i was of course alarmed when i opened the door to such a site.  he quickly explained who he was and asked if he could have just a few minutes of my time.  i didn't believe anything he was saying but i figured the risk of transmission was low due to his protective gear and frankly, i was ready for some human interaction, even from a potential crazy person, so i let him in.  he sat down and said he wanted to tell me some things about the future because if this knowledge was entrusted to me, i could be trusted to use it for good.  over the next few minutes he told me about many things but i was left with many questions.  he said i could ask a few, so i did.  i asked about climate change.  he assured me that after 2035, nations got serious and the problem has been all but solved.  i asked about covid-19.  he assured me it would be a blip on the radar of human history and nobody worries about pandemics anymore.  i asked about massive economic turmoil we are in.  he said despite the borrowing and deficits of earlier times, those debts are now repaid. the united states has never been a better more united society.  everyone has free healthcare.  i was so happy to hear all this.  i asked about inflation and how much it costs for a gallon of water, or a loaf of bread or a cup of coffee.  he chuckled and said i didn't need to worry about such trivial things.  in the year 2045, it was possible to still get coffee at starbucks in america for under 150 yuan.	1

"a man dies and finds himself in an elevator he did expect a light at the end of the tunnel and all that, but he decides to see where things are going. pretty soon, the destination of his elevator-ride is showing up on the display: ""hell""   ""well"", the man thinks, ""i've had a good life. fair's fair i guess.""   the elevator opens and to his surprise hell isn't all fire and brimstone - it's a lush meadow with a pleasant blue sky and a small man in a white suit waiting for him, a beaming smile on his face.   ""excuse me"", the man asks, ""i think i'm at the wrong place.""   ""no, no, i assure you, this is alright"", the man in the white suit says. ""this is indeed hell. and yes, i am the devil.""   the man is surprised but decides not to question it. instead he asks: ""can i have a look around?""   ""feel free"", the devil encourages him.   so the man walks around and finds hell to be rather pleasant. people sitting at swimming pools, laughing, talking, enjoying what seems to be the best food afterlife has to offer. but after a while, he notices a huge wall in the distance. curious, he approaches and finds that the wall seems to be stretching infinitely in both directions. he follows it for a while and eventually spots a crack which he looks through.   on the other side, it's hell in the worst sense: fire is everywhere. people are screaming in agonizing pain as red-hot hooks are pierced through their skin. they are boiled alive, every bone in their body gets broken and demons of all shapes and sizes laugh at their pain. struck with horror, the man turns around to run but freezes as he sees the devil standing behind him.   ""what's up with that wall?"", the man asks in horror.   ""oh, that"", the devil says offhandely. ""that's the christians. it's the way they want it."""	1

""tina and i procreated. when the baby came out red-haired, she said that she used to sit by the window and watch red-haired construction workers across the street, and that's why the baby turned out red-haired. a year later, when she got pregnant, she was sitting by the window and saw a black mailman delivering mail across the street, so naturally, the kid came out black.""  the mother nodded her head.

"it's my cake day, so here's a classic! there was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. he knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. so he went to a sex shop and started looking around. he goes up to the clerk and explains his situation. the old man said, ""well, i don't really know of anything that will do the trick. we have vibrating dildos, strap ons, eggs, bullets, wing-wangers and fling-flongers...""  the businessman interrupts, ""none of those will do, i need the most top-of-the-line stuff you have! isn't there something special, maybe in the back?""  but i don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. ""except what?"" the man asked. ""nothing, nothing."" ""c'mon, tell me! i need something!"" ""well, sir, i don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'"" ""so what's up with this voodoo dick?"" he asked.  the old man nods, goes in the back for a minute, and comes back with an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. he opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo.   the businessman laughed, and said ""big deal. it looks like every other dildo in this shop!""   the old man replied, ""but you haven't seen what it'll do yet."" he pointed to a door and said ""voodoo dick, the door!""   the voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. the whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle.   before the door could split, the old man said ""voodoo dick, get back in your box!""   the voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more.   ""i'll take it!"" said the businessman, awestruck with what he has seen.  the old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $1500 in cash.   the guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say ""voodoo dick, my pvssy."" he left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.  after he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. she thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. she got it out, and said ""voodoo dick, my pussy!"" the voodoo dick got to work. it was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.   after three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. she tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.   her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. so she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. she put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.   on the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. he asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.  the officer looked at her for a second, and then said ""yeah, right.. voodoo dick, my ass!"""	1

"a man has been in a bar throwing them back all night. since he is a regular and never causes any trouble, the bartender lets him stay well past closing time.   the bartender has washed all the glasses, swept the floors, wiped the bar and tables down, and has closed down for the night. the bartender finally kicks him out just as the sun is coming up.   the drunk just about falls into the street right as a nun in a full black habit is walking by. they're both a little startled and there is an awkward standoff for moment.   without a word, the drunk punches the nun square in the mouth. as the nun staggers back, he follows up with a sloppy one- two combo to the chin. the nun falls to the ground. he staggers over and gives her one final kick to the gut.   he stands over her, points down and proudly says, ""you ain't so tough, batman."""	1

"one day i was on vacation... and i left the hotel to go grab dinner. i was walking along the sidewalk downtown and i see three people standing outside of an unmarked building. so, being the usual tourist, i go up to them and i ask them what they are waiting for.   one guy turns around and says, ""hey, this guy in the store hits you in the face, and then he gives you an awesome secret prize!""   so im thinking to myself that there is no way any gift is worth that and i just tell the guy ""ah okay, cool."" and walk away.   i get about 20 yards down the sidewalk before i hear a guy bursting out of that store, absolutely screaming with joy saying he just recieved the best gift in his life. he joyfully skips down the street before anyone can even process whats going on.  i kinda just shrugged my shoulders and went on my way thinking these locals were just crazy, or just trying to trick a curious tourist. however, the very next day, im walking down the same street and come upon that same unmarked building, this time with around 20 people waiting outside.  i walk by, go up to the nearest guy and ask him ""is this the place where you wait to get hit in the face and recieve a secret prize?""  the man responded, ""you've been?? you gotta tell me what he gave you!!""  i said, ""sorry man, i didnt go in, but i saw this same thing yesterday. i just thought someone knew what it was by now""   the man then said, ""oh shoot. well, people have been running out with pure joy all day, each of them too distracted to explain anything, and i just had to see what the hype was about, so im here waiting to get socked in the face like a fool."" he laughs and rolls his eyes as he realises how ridiculous he sounds.  i shrug my shoulders again and decide to keep walking because i had some plans already. however, on my way back, about an hour later, i pass by to see that same row of people coming out of the building, but now it extends all the way down the block.   i see the guy i just spoke to an hour sooner burst out of the building, with a black eye, jumping in the air with joy. hes screaming and exclaiming ""hoooly cow! that was definitely worth the wait! ha-ha!!""  i quickly reacted before he could bolt down the street, and i was able to snag him and hold him still by his shoulders for just a moment.   me: ""hey, man!""   hes looking beyond me with a blank stare and a huuge grin  me: ""hellooo pay attention!"" *snaps fingers*  finally i get his attention and he just says ""maan, its something you gotta experience for yourself, and believe me, its worth getting hit in the face for.""  so, the curiosity gets the best of me and i decided to give it a try. i walk along the gigantic row that has filled the sidewalks. i walk one block...two blocks...seven blocks...hundreds of people... and i didnt feel like waiting, so i just headed back to the hotel.  _______________________________________________ at this point your listener is scratching their head and says something along the lines of:   ""what? is that the joke? i dont get it.""   to which you say:   ""well, normally a joke like this would have a more satisfying ending, but i felt that the punch line was too long"""	1

""i just called you about prowlers in my storage shed. well you do not have to worry, as i just shot them all dead!"" within seconds there were 3 police cars, an ambulance and fire engine at the scene. after capturing the prowlers red-handed, the policeman asked the caller, ""i thought you said you had shot them all!"" the man answered, ""i thought you said there were no police available!"""	1
a young man gets a flat tire and must find a place to stay for the night... he knocks on the door of a nearby house and an old man greets him.  the old man hears out the young mans predicament, and allows him to stay for a night.  later the young man hears strange noises coming from a red door on the other side of his room but goes to sleep anyway. asking the old man the next morning what made those noises, he told him:   âi canât tell you, youâre not a priest.â  the young man takes off and several years pass.  coincidentally, the same series of events happen later on where the young man gets another flat tire and goes to the old mans house knowing of his past generosity.  once again the old man allows him to stay the night, and once again the younger man hears weird noises from the red door across the room where he sleeps.  the next morning he asks the old man what the noises are and he tells him:  âi canât tell you, youâre not a priest.â  but this time, the young man is a priest because he has finished that schooling and gotten a job at his local church.  telling the old man this, he is given a set of rainbow keys and is led to the red door.  putting the red key in the red door, the young man opens it and the old man tells gestures to him to move forward on his own.  after walking down a long hallway the man finds an orange door where he uses the orange key to open the orange door and he turns left.  he walks down another long hallway and finds a yellow door which he opens with the yellow key.  turning right this time, he walks down one more hallway and opens a green door with the green key.  going down a flight of stairs he unlocks the blue door with predictable methods now and with little light remaining in the room he locates the purple door.  finally opening it with the last key, the young man gazed upon the source of the noises causing his confusion.  âwhat was it that caused the noise??â you are probably asking...  well...    i canât tell you, youâre not a priest.	1

a man walks into a bar with a donkey and an ostrich. he sits down at the counter and asks for a beer.  âthat will be 5.98$, sir.â, the bartender says.  the man, puts his hand into his pocket and pulls out 5 dollars and 98 cents in exact change.  âhow much will it cost to buy everyone here a round of drinks?â, the man asks, taking a sip of his drink.  âthat would cost 257.54$, sir.â, the bartender says, looking at the register.  âlet  everyone have a round of drinks on me.â, the man replied, pulling out  exactly 257 dollars and 54 cents out of his pocket. âand while youâre at  it, get a bowl of water for my donkey and ostrich.â  everyone in the bar is cheering as they get a free drink.  looking at their reaction, the man goes âeh, fuck it. what is the total tab of all these people in the bar?â  â3325.79$, sir.â, the bartender asks after adding up all active tabs in the bar.  the  man puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out a huge stack of bills and  some coins and hands it over without even counting them.  after counting it, the bartender finds that the man handed over exactly 3325.79$.  now  curious, he asks the man âhow is it that you are able to pull out the  exact amount of money needed every time? are you some magician?â  âiâll tell you if you can keep it a secret.â the stranger replies.  âof courseâ, the bartender says.  âwell,  this happened around a year ago, i was walking by the street next to my  house and tripped over something. i looked back to see what had nearly  made me fall and saw that it was a lamp, all shiny and golden.â  âsuddenly, a puff of smoke clouded my vision, when i could see again, there was a genie there!â  âhe said ânow that you have made me free  i shall grant you wishes three.â now, the most important thing in the  world right now is money, and i thought to just ask for a large sum of  money. i thought about it a little, i realised  that just asking for a large sum of money straight up is kind of  stupid, it would be hard to manage and it would look very suspicious in  my bank account.â  âi  thought about it a little more and decided to ask that whenever i put  my hand in my pocket, i will always have the exact amount of money i  need for that situation in it. this way, i have seemingly infinite money  without the hassles of carrying it around and risking it being stolen.â  the  bartender, now impressed at his way of thinking, says âwow, you seem really smart, i never would have thought of that. you found a creative way to get the benefits of infinite money without any of the dangers.â  âif your first wish was so ingenious, you surely must have asked for something equally clever for your other two wishes. so what did you ask for using your last two wishes?â, the bartender asks.  the man replies, âa chick with long legs and a big ass.â	1

a horse and a hen are playing in a field... a horse and a hen are playing in a field...  one day a horse and a hen are playing in a field. the horse gets stuck in a puddle of mud, and starts to sink. the hen is frantically searching for anything to help her friend, so she decides to go back to the barn. there, she grabs the keys to the farmerâs mercedes and drives to where the horse is stuck. she throws a rope around the horseâs neck, and slams on the accelerator, saving the horse from sinking in the puddle.  a few days go by and they are playing in the field again. this time, the hen gets stuck.  hen: âhelp, go get the car like i did for you and help me out!â  the horse, realizing there isnât much time since the hen is much smaller than he, stretches out over the length of the puddle.  horse: reach up and grab hold of my âthingâ.  the hen obliges, and the horse starts to stand straight up to pull his friend out of the puddle.  moral of this story: if youâre hung like a horse, then >!you donât need a mercedes to pick up chicks!<	1

the young woman who submitted the tech support message presumably did it as a joke. then she got a reply that was way too good to keep to herself. the query: dear tech support,  last year i upgraded from boyfriend 5.0 to husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slowdown in overall system performance, particularly in the flower and jewelry applications and intimacy, which operated flawlessly under boyfriend 5.0. in addition, husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as romance 9.5 and personal attention 6.5, and then installed undesirable programs such as: nba 5.0, nfl 3.0 and golf 4.1  conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and house cleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. please note that i have tried running nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. what can i do? signed, desperatebe careful of which tech support you choose.love to allmom/grandma/ ant jody/jo  the response (that came weeks later out of the blue):  dear desperate, first keep in mind, boyfriend 5.0 is an entertainment package, while husband 1.0 is an operating system. please enter command: i thought you loved me.html and try to download tears 6.2 do not forget to install the guilt 3.0 update. if that application works as designed, husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications jewelry 2.0 and flowers 3.5. however, remember, overuse of the above application can cause husband 1.0 to default to grumpy silence 2.5, happy hour 7.0, or beer 6.1. please note that beer 6.1 is a very bad program that will download the farting and snoring loudly beta version. whatever you do, do not, under any circumstances, install mother-in-law 1.0 as it runs a virus in the background that will eventually seize control of all your system resources. in addition, please do not attempt to re-install the boyfriend 5.0 program. these are unsupported applications and will crash husband 1.0. in summary, husband 1.0 is a great program, but it does have limited memory and cannot learn new applications quickly. you might consider buying additional software to improve memory and performance. we recommend cooking 3.0. good luck!  tech support	1

a man was walking home past a cemetary in the middle of the night.  when he hears a bump... bump... bump... behind him.  walking faster he looks back, and makes out the image of an upright coffin banging its way down the middle of the street towards him.  bump... bump... bump...  terrified, the man begins to run towards his home, the coffin bouncing quickly behind him ...  faster... faster... bump... bump... bump...  he runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him.  however, the coffin crashes through his door, with the lid of the coffin clapping...  clappity-bump... clappity-bump... clappity-bump... on the heels of the terrified man.  rushing upstairs to the bathroom, the man locks himself in.  his heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.  with a loud crash the coffin starts breaking down the door. bumping and clapping towards him.  the man screams and reaches for something heavy, anything .. his hand comes to rest on a large bottle of robitussin.  desperate, he throws the cough syrup as hard as he can at the apparition... and...  the coffin stops.	1

"" it sure is dark in here... it'd be a shame if i were to... scream."" whispers the boy slyly.   "" please don't tell, i'll give you anything! "" the cheater whispers back.  after quite a bit of thought, the boy says ""would you give me 10 bucks?"" . the man hastily complies. several weeks later, they find themselves in a similar situation, once again in the closet.   ""boy, it sure is dark in here. it'd be a shame if i were to scream and let my dad know.""   the man says, ""what do you want this time?""    the boy walks away 100 dollars richer.  weeks later, they find themselves in the **same** closet in the same situation. this time, the boy requests 1,000 dollars.   ""what?!? i don't have that kind of money!"" snaps the man. "" blackmail is just as wrong as cheating! you're catholic, right? go and confess to the priest. ""  the boy begrudgingly complies. the next day, he walks into the cathedral and finds his way to the confessional. he sighs, then tried to see if his trick will work on the priest.

"two beggars were sitting side by side in front of the love fountain in rome, italy. one had a cross in front of him; the other one was holding the star of david. many people went by, looked at both beggars, but only put money into the box of the beggar sitting behind the cross.  the pope came to the area. he stopped to watch the throngs of people giving money to the beggar who held the cross while none gave to the beggar holding the star of david. he felt sorry for him.  finally, the pope approached the beggar with the star of david and said ""my poor friend, don't you understand? this is a catholic country; this city is the symbol of catholicism. people aren't going to give you money if you sit there with a star of david in front of you, especially when you're sitting beside a beggar who is holding a cross. in fact, they would probably give more money to him just out of spite!""  the beggar with the star of david listened to the pope, smiled, turned to the beggar who sits next to him with the cross and says, âmoishe, look who's trying to teach the goldstein brothers about marketing?"""	1

"managing a ranch a successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife.  she was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.   two cowboys applied for the job. one was gay and the other a drunk.   she thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. ... see more  he proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and, as luck would have it, he knew a lot about ranching.   for weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well.   then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, ""you have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. you should go into town and kick up your heels."" the hired hand readily agreed and went into town one saturday night.   one o'clock came, however, and he didn't return   two o'clock and no hired hand.   finally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.   she quietly called him over to her.   ""unbutton my blouse and take it off,"" she said.   trembling, he did as she directed. ""now take off my boots.""   he did as she asked, ever so slowly.

""now take off my bra."" again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.   then she looked at him and said, ""if you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired."""	1

""theft. i used to be quite an unscrupulous man when i was younger. i was damn good at it too. never caught once.""  ""but how did you end up in prison if you never got caught?""  ""i'll get to that. so anyway, i started out by stealing iron from the mines of the trolls. there was this ventilation duct in the mine where someone of my stature had no problem getting both in and out with it. this worked out for a while, until...""  he paused and took a swig of his drink.  ""i got greedy. so i moved on to a higher value target. i started stealing copper from the hobgoblins. but it was stressful. the bastards have a good sense of smell, so i had to smear myself with cow-dung before every heist. it's not a pretty sight, and the smell lasts for days.""  ""it didn't really take long before i took it even further, and started stealing the silver that the fairies were digging up to use for their fairy dust. it was easier and more lucrative than the previous job. but at this point my conscience had started to wear on me. i'm not a god fearing man by any means, but i could feel as if i was being judged.""  ""so what happened then?"", i inquired.  ""well, i thought it was just going to be one more gig. one last job to make bank. so this time, i targeted the most high value mining operation in the land, but i couldn't go through with it. i had a mental breakdown and turned myself in on the spot.""
