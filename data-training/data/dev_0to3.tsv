two great musicians hated each other and after years of always being compared to one another, they finally decided to have a duet of guitars to see which was the better player. they carefully selected an audience of musical experts, and with that they played.  after a fifteen minutes duet, the vote was cast. amazingly, the results were a dead heat- half of the audience voted for one, half voted for the other.  angrily, the first musician took out a clarinet.  “let’s see how you manage this” he hissed at the second musician. the second musician dutifully brought out his own and they played. thirty minutes later, both musicians tired but nonetheless angry, asked the audience to cast their vote.   the votes were tallied. again, completely equal. aghast but furious, the second musician brought out a piano, the first followed, and they played away. a full hour of a duet. rachmaninov’s piano concerto in triple time, flight of the forty million bumblebees. the musicians were exhausted but enraged. the vote cast. another dead heat.  so it went on. each duet a different instrument, a longer time, a dead heat. bassoons, oboes, flutes, swiss alpine horns, ouds, theremins, holophonors, the list went on.  sweating profusely, absolutely livid, the first musician had enough. he staggered over and reached his hand into an ornate box. suddenly the second musician, terrified thrust out his arm in desperation.  “no! we must not resort to violins”	3

"you talk?" he asks.   "yep," the lab replies.   after the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says "so, what's your story?"  the lab looks up and says, "well, i discovered that i could talk when  i was pretty young. i wanted to help the government, so i told the cia.  in no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting  in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog  would be  eavesdropping.  "i was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running. but  the jetting around really tired me out, and i knew i wasn't getting any  younger so i decided to settle down. i signed up for a job at the  airport to do some  undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening  in. i uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of  medals.  "i got married, had a mess of puppies, and now i'm just retired."  the guy is amazed. he goes back  in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.   "ten dollars," the guy says.  "ten dollars? this dog is amazing! why on earth are you selling him so cheap??"  "because the dog's a damn liar. he never did any of that shit."	3

customer satisfaction don't think i've seen this posted here so here goes  a company executive decided to have lunch at this restaurant with rave reviews. he sat down at a table and noticed that every waiter had a spoon in their shirt pocket. he called a waiter over to ask him about this.  'i noticed something peculiar... why does every waiter have a spoon in their pocket?"  'neat observation sir! our restaurant's goal is to maximise customer satisfaction. a study showed that most of our patrons drop utensils quite frequently, and the spoon gets dropped more often than the fork. our spare utensils are kept in the kitchen. rather than going all the way and spending more time than needed, our management came up with this idea. by keeping a spoon in our pocket, our waiters can instantly hand the patron a new one, maximising our productivity and customer satisfaction at the same time! a study before and after this showed a massive increase in customer satisfaction."  the executive was impressed. "oh... that's very good! another thing i noticed was this. everyone seems to have a cord sown onto the front of their pants. what is that for?"  "wow sir! you are sharp eyed indeed! this was another initiative by management. when we urinate, we wash our hands after we're done to stay hygienic. now, washing hands takes at least 20 seconds, valuable time we could spend helping the patrons out. these cords are meant for supporting our penises, and once we're done, to lift them and drop them back into our pants. our hands stay clean, and we don't waste any time at all!"  the bemused executive had one more query.  "i am very impressed by your restaurant! one last thing... why don't you have the cord on your pant?"  the waiter broke out into a smile. "your observation skills are extraordinary sir!"  he lowered his voice and leaned in.  "between you and me sir...  i use the spoon."	1

attitude adjustment for her birthday, jane received a fully-grown parrot as a gift. it was a brilliantly colored, with plumes of emerald green, sunset orange, ocean blue, and ruby red. but the parrot had a vocabulary worse than a sailor's. every other word was profanity; those that weren't profanity were, to say the least, rude.  jane tried to change the bird's attitude by constantly saying polite words, playing soft music -  anything she could think of. nothing worked.  she tried yelling at the bird and the bird got worse. she shook the bird and the bird became even madder and ruder. finally, in a moment of desperation, jane put the parrot in the freezer to get a minute of peace.  for a few moments, she heard the bird swearing, squawking, kicking, and screaming. then, suddenly, there was absolute quiet. jane was worried that she might have actually hurt the bird and quickly opened the freezer door.  the parrot quietly stepped out onto jane's extended arm. perfectly calm, the parrot said, "i am very sorry that i offended you with my language and my actions and i seek your forgiveness. i will endeavor to correct my behavior, and i am sure it will never happen again."  jane was astounded at the changes in the bird's attitude and was about to ask what had changed him when the parrot continued,  "may i ask what the chicken did?"	3

an american anthropologist is studying cultures throughout western africa. he discovers an isolated civilization in the west african jungle.  it’s a small village with wooden houses and plenty of domesticated animals.  the anthropologist is impressed by the organization of the village and becomes eager to learn more about the culture of it’s inhabitants.    he approaches a group of villagers and introduces himself.  they welcome him kindly and are very hospitable, offering him ethnical food and drinks of their culture.  to his surprise, the few hundreds of people of the village speak perfect english.    after hours of socializing with the villagers, he notices one of them walk off into the forest and disappear for a while and then return, seemingly exhausted.  curious about this behavior and if it has any cultural significance, he secretly follows the next villager that walks away.    after a mile of stalking the villager through the forest, he reaches a clearance.  he sees an organized line of villagers leading to a tall narrow wooden tower in the distance.  he watches as one villager climbs the side of the tower, sits on top of it, and stares off into the distance.  then after a while, the villager climbs back down and another climbs up to preform the same ritual.  the anthropologist becomes curious of this ritual and of the significance of the tower.  he believes it must be some sort of religious shrine and wants to get closer to inspect it.  he walks past the line of villagers and approaches the tower.  he explains to the next villager in line that he is vey interested in their culture and intrigued by the tower and that he would love to climb the tower next to see the view from the top.  the villager politely allows him to climb next so he grabs the wooden knobs that protrude from the outside wall of the tower and begins to climb.    upon reaching the top, he notices fecal matter all over the outside edges and a terrible aroma emanating from a large hole on the top surface.   he realizes that the villagers have been defecating in the hole on top and he is completely repulsed.  he immediately climbs back down as fast as he can in a state of disgust.    when he gets back to the bottom, he’s sweating and out of breathe from the climb.  the villagers ask him if he enjoyed himself and was pleased by the findings of his curious investigation.    “to be honest i’m quite underwhelmed.  i thought this tower was going to be something of more amusement and significance that i could share with my colleagues back home” stated the anthropologist.   “nope” replied a villager “it’s just a really long shitpost”	2

so there was this man in bulgaria who drove trains for a living    he loved his job. driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. he loved to make the train go as fast as possible. unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. he made it out, but a single person died. well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. he was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. when the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. after eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. the man was perfectly fine.      well, at the time, there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. the trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. for his final meal, the man requested two bananas. after eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.      well, this of course meant that he was free to go. and once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. to what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. on the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.      "you know what? no," said the executioner. "i've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. i'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now." well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. the switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. the executioner was speechless.  the man looked at the executioner and said, "oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. i'm just a bad conductor."	2

an american soldier, serving in world war ii, had just returned from several weeks of intense action on the german front lines. he had finally been granted r&r and was on a train bound for london. the train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. the only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.  the war weary soldier asked, "please, ma'am, may i sit in that seat?" the english woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, "you americans. you are such a rude class of people. can't you see my little fifi is using that seat?" the soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.  again he asked, "please, lady. may i sit there? i'm very tired." the english woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, "you americans! not only are you rude, you are also arrogant."  the soldier didn"t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.  the woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.  an english gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, "you know, sir, you americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. you eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. you drive your automobiles on the wrong side of the road. and now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window."	3

an old preacher was dying. he sent a message for his banker and his lawyer, both church members, to come to his home.   when  they arrived, they were ushered up to his bedroom. as they entered the room, the preacher held out his hands and motioned for them to sit on each side of the bed. the preacher grasped their hands, sighed contentedly, smiled, and stared at the ceiling. for a time, no one said anything.   both the banker and lawyer were honored that the preacher would ask them to be with him during his final moments. they were also puzzled; the preacher had never given them any indication that he particularly liked either of them. they both remembered his many long, uncomfortable sermons about greed, covetousness, and avaricious behavior that made them squirm in their seats.   finally, the banker said, "preacher, why did you ask us to come?"   the old preacher mustered up his strength and then said weakly, "jesus died between two thieves, and that's how i want to go."	2

found this, i think you might enjoy, source in comments a store that sells husbands has just opened where a woman may go to choose a husband from among many men. the store is composed of 6 floors, and the men increase in positive attributes as the shopper ascends the flights.   there is, however, a catch. as you open the door to any floor you may choose a man from that floor, but if you go up a floor, you cannot go back down except to exit the building.   so a woman goes to the shopping center to find a husband.   on the first floor the sign on the door reads:   floor 1 - these men have jobs.   the woman reads the sign and says to herself, "well, that's better than my last boyfriend, but i wonder what's further up?" so up she goes.   the second floor sign reads:   floor 2 - these men have jobs and love kids.   the woman remarks to herself, "that's great, but i wonder what's further up?" and up she goes again.   the third floor sign reads:   floor 3 - these men have jobs, love kids and are extremely good looking.   "hmmm, better" she says. "but i wonder what's upstairs?"   the fourth floor sign reads:   floor 4 - these men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking and help with the housework.   "wow!" exclaims the woman, "very tempting. but, there must be more further up!" and again she heads up another flight.   the fifth floor sign reads:   floor 5 - these men have jobs, love kids, are extremely good looking, help with the housework and have a strong romantic streak.   "oh, mercy me! but just think... what must be awaiting me further on?" so up to the sixth floor she goes.   the sixth floor sign reads:   floor 6 - you are visitor 6,875,953,012 to this floor. there are no men on this floor. this floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please.	3

a redneck and an annoying stranger are sitting next to each other on a 12 hour plane ride... the stranger is pretty well dressed and, after a few drinks becomes very loud and disruptive. he starts boasting that hes the smartest man on the plane. after a few minutes of unsuccessfully trying to get people to engage with him, a stewardess tells the stranger he needs to be quiet and stop disturbing the other passengers.  irritated by this, the stranger nudges the redneck in his dirty boots, cowboy hat, and plaid shirt and said,  "let's talk. i've heard that flights will go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger, and this cabin is full of a bunch of morons."  jimbob, who had just tilted his hat over his eyes to get some sleep, tilted it back up slowly and said to the stranger,  "yeeahp i hear that, whatcha wana talk 'bout?"  "oh, i don't know," said the stranger who began to grin, because he was about to show this dumb redneck how much smarter he is "how about nuclear power?"  "yeeahp. i dont much care for it" said jimbob.  "ok" said the stranger "why dont you ask me a question, and if i can answer it you have to pay for my next drink, and if i cant then ill leave you alone to sleep"  jimbob considers for a moment, then says  "a horse, a cow, and a deer all eat grass - the same stuff. yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. why do you suppose that is?"  after considering for a minute, stranger says "jeez, i have no idea."  "well, then," said jimbob as he tilted his hat back down and leaned his seat back, "how is it that you feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don't know shit?	3

making a baby the smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. on the day the proxy father was to arrive, mr. smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, 'well, i'm off now. the man should be here soon.'  half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. 'good morning, ma'am', he said, 'i've come to...'  'oh, no need to explain,' mrs. smith cut in, embarrassed, 'i've been expecting you.'  'have you really?' said the photographer. 'well, that's good. did you know babies are my specialty?'  'well that's what my husband and i had hoped. please come in and have a seat!'  after a moment she asked, blushing, 'well, where do we start?'  'leave everything to me. i usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. and sometimes the living room floor is fun. you can really spread out there.'  'bathtub, living room floor? no wonder it didn't work out for harry and me!'  'well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. but if we try several different positions and i shoot from six or seven angles, i'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'  'my, that's a lot!', gasped mrs. smith.  'ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. i'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but i'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'  'don't i know it,' said mrs. smith quietly.  the photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'this was done on the top of a bus,' he said.  'oh, my god!' mrs. smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.  'and these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'  'she was difficult?' asked mrs. smith.  'yes, i'm afraid so. i finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. people were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look'  'four and five deep?' said mrs. smith, her eyes wide with amazement.  'yes', the photographer replied. 'and for more than three hours, too. the mother was constantly squealing and yelling - i could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached i had to rush my shots. finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, i just had to pack it all in.'  mrs. smith leaned forward. 'do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh....equipment?'  'it's true, ma'am, yes.. well, if you're ready, i'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'  'tripod?'  'oh yes, ma'am. i need to use a tripod to rest my canon on. it's much too big to be held in the hand very long.'  mrs. smith fainted	3

"we do not take kindly to trespassers. you must pass a test, and if you fail, we'll throw you back into the ocean! go into the jungle, and bring me back a fruit!"  the three head out. the german assumes that the first person to return wins, and grabs a tiny fruit off the nearest tree he can find.  when he gets back, the chief tells him to strip. "we'll stick it up your butt, and if you make any noise, you fail!"  the german manages this fairly easily, breathing a sigh of relief at his luck. not long after, the french tourist returns, sporting a banana. the process is repeated, and with clenched teeth, he manages to stay silent almost the entire way. but at the very end, he suddenly bursts out laughing.  "you almost had it! what happened?" asks the german.  "could not help myself." says the frenchman. "i saw the american come back with a pineapple."	1

my grandfather died and i inherited some of his clothes.  he was a poultry farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.  after a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken activities. i always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.  when he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. when my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and i smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.  why am i telling you all of this backstory? because the last time i tried to tell this to someone and i didn't give context, they thought it was weird that i was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.	2

the joke my great-grandpa told me about 15 years ago a man kisses his wife goodnight and goes to sleep one day. after he wakes up, he notices an old man in white robes lying next to him instead of his wife.   - who are you and why are you in my bed?! - he asks.   - this is not your bedroom. i am st peter and you're in heaven.   - what?! i'm dead? it can't be! bring me back to earth, now!   - it's not that easy. you can either come back as a chicken, or a dog.   the man thinks about it and figures that a chicken's life is more calm then dog's life.   - bring me back as a dog. - exclaims the man.      suddenly, the man appears as a chicken on a farm. another chicken approaches him and says:   - you must be the new chicken that st peter told me about.   - oh yes that's me.   - so, how do you like being a chicken?   - well, i feel like my rump is going to explode!   the other chicken shrugs with his wings and says:   - you got to lay an egg to get some relief.   - and how am i supposed to do that?!   - cackle two times and then push as hard as you can.      the man-chicken cackles and pushes as hard as he can.   - wow, that was great! i want to lay some more eggs!   and he pushes, and lays another one, and another. suddenly, he hears his wife screaming:   - john, wake up! you have shat all over the bed!	1

two guys are walking down a street and see an old man in front of them. he walks in such a weird manner that is almost similar to a duck. somehow this walk bothers the two guys. "i wonder why he's walking that way. what could be the reason for that?" one guy asks the other. the other guy replies "maybe he got into an accident recently and might have broken his hip or something". "what if he has a congenital defect and can't walk properly because of that?" the first guy asks again. "let's just ask from himself" second guy suggests.  so they run towards the old man walking in front of them. "excuse me, sir. we have a question for you. can you please tell us the reason why you're walking that way? my friend here guessed it's a congenital defect and i guessed it's from an accident. who guessed it correctly?" asks the second guy. the old man looks at them and slowly smiles. he says "well. your friend guessed something, and he got it wrong. you guessed something, and you got it wrong. i also guessed something when i was walking down this street, and i got it wrong too. i thought it was going to be just a tiny fart".	3

grandma is eighty-eight years old and still drives her own car. she writes: dear grand-daughter,   the other day i went up to our local christian book store and saw a "honk" if you love jesus' bumper sticker. i was feeling particularly sassy that day because i had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting. so, i bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.  boy, am i glad i did; what an uplifting experience that followed.  i was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the lord and how good he is, and i didn't notice that the light had changed.   it is a good thing someone else loves jesus because if he hadn't honked, i'd never have noticed. i found that lots of people love jesus! while i was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, 'for the love of god!' 'go! go! go! jesus christ, go!'   what an exuberant cheerleader he was for jesus! everyone started honking! i just leaned out my window and started waving and smiling at all those loving people. i even honked my horn a few times to share in the love! ; there must have been a man from florida back there because i heard him yelling something about a sunny beach.   i saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. i asked my young teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant. he said it was probably a hawaiian good luck sign or something. well, i have never met anyone from hawaii , so i leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign right back.   my grandson burst out laughing. why even he was enjoying this religious experience!! a couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. i bet they wanted to pray or ask what church i attended, but this is when i noticed the light had changed. so, grinning, i waved at all my brothers and sisters, and drove on through the intersection.   i noticed that i was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and felt kind of sad that i had to leave them after all the love we had shared. so, i slowed the car down, leaned out the window and gave them all the hawaiian good luck sign one last time as i drove away. praise the lord for such wonderful folks!!   will write again soon,   love, grandma	3

a world champion in grizzly bear hunting wanted to shoot a polar one he's got yet another prize in usa for hunting grizzlies, proving he's the best there is. doesn't matter how hard it would be to hunt one, he would track them and hunt them.  one day he wanted the challenge, and thought he would step up his game and hunt for polar bears. he's no expert in polar bears, but for sure some things are the same, right? grizzly bears and polar bears are bears after all. so he went to russia, siberia to be precise. no knowing where to find information about hunting a polar bear, he entered the local's inn and proudly announced: "i am the world champion in grizzly bear hunting! i want to hunt a polar bear though, is there anyone brave anough to help me?"  with all eyes on him the inn went silent for several seconds, until a big, muscular man, wearing animals leather on his shoulders got up and said: "my name is ivan, this is my dog charlie, we will help you."  our guy were a little scared of him (russian guy was massive), but didn't ask question and they later just went for the hunt.  while in the woods (white everywhere, snow everywhere) they were marching in silence, with ivan and dog charlie on the front. suddenly, the russian stops and says:  "ok look. on top of this tree, look" (he points at the tree) "there is a polar bear. here, take this shotgun." (he then gives the american the shotgun, which he takes no questions asked). "the plan is as follows: i climb up the tree, throw off the polar bear to the ground and my dog charlie fucks him to death."  "okaaaay, but then why did u give me the gun?"  "if i get down first, shoot the dog."	2

surprising horse a couple from london, john, sarah and their 6 year old son jimmy, win £8 million on the lottery and they decide to fulfill their lifelong dream - to quit the rat race and buy a farm with animals in the countryside.   they eventually find the property of their dreams and make arrangements to buy it, along with with a wide array of farm animals. a few months later, when they are settled in, they decide to invite the local vicar and his wife around for sunday lunch in an effort to get to know their neighbours.   before the meal, john, sarah, the vicar and his wife were sitting around the kitchen table talking, when the door suddenly flew open and in rushed jimmy shouting "mum, dad, the bull is f**cking the cow!" john and sarah were horrified and embarrassed that their guests should hear such coarse language. they both apologised profusely to the vicar and his wife and asked if lunch could be postponed to the following sunday.   meanwhile, john and sarah took jimmy to one side and said, "jimmy, it would have been so much better if you had told us that the bull was 'surprising' the cow instead of using the word you did".  next sunday, just as before, the couple, as well as the vicar and his wife were sitting chatting before lunch, when again the door burst suddenly open and in rushed jimmy breathlessly announcing "mum, dad, the bull is surprising all the cows", "he can't be surprising all the cows" said his mother, "he is mum" said jimmy," he's f**cking the horse!".  (not my joke; copypasta from elsewhere)	1

"yes. yes, i did.' he gleamed with pride.  "when did you graduate?" i asked.  he answered, "in 1987. why do you ask?"  "you were in my class!!!!", i exclaimed.  he looked at me closely.  then,  that ugly, old, bald, wrinkled faced, gray-haired, decrepit, idiot, asked,  "what subject did you teach" ?"	1

a young man goes off to college a young man goes off to college, but about one-third of the way through the semester, he's foolishly squandered the money his parents had given him.

"read!?" says his father. ""no kidding! what do i have to do to get him in that program?"    "just send $2,500, i'll get him in the class," the son says. so the father sends the money.    at the end of the semester, the son finds he has a problem. when he gets home, his father is going to find out that the dog can neither talk nor read, so he shoots the dog. when he gets home, his father is all excited.    "where's rex?" asks his father. "i can't wait to hear him talk and listen to him read something!"    "dad," the son says, "i have some pretty grim news. when i got out of the shower this morning, rex was in the living room kicking back in the recliner, reading the morning paper, like he usually does. then he turned to me and asked, 'so, is your dad still messin' around with that hot blonde who lives on minute street?'"    the father replies, "damn! i sure hope you shot that lyin' dog!"    the son replies, "i sure did, dad!"	3

"just great," says the businessman. "i'm playing the best golf of my life. my new arm has a much finer touch and my putting has really improved."  "that's great," says the surgeon.  "not only that," continues the golfer, "my hand writing has improved, i've learned how to sew my own clothes and i've even taken up painting landscapes in watercolors."

jack is a cowboy working on a large ranch in a remote pasture in wyoming. one day as he’s overseeing the livestock on the ranch a brand-new 7 series bmw suddenly advances towards him creating an enormous cloud of dust in the process  the car stops and the driver is a young man in a brioni suit, gucci shoes, ray-ban sunglasses and ysl tie. he steps out of the car and says to the cowboy, “if i tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?“  jack looks at the man, who’s obviously a yuppie, he then looks at his peacefully grazing animals and responds calmly, “sure, why not?“  the yuppie then whips out a very impressive iphone 11 pro smartphone from his jacket pocket and begins to surf the nasa website. simultaneously he uses the gps satellite to get the exact coordinates of his location. he then feeds that back to google earth to capture a high-resolution image of this location.  the young man then opens the digital image in photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in langley, virginia.  within seconds, he receives an email to his iphone 11 pro to confirm that the image has been processed and the data captured and stored. he then accesses an ms-sql database through an odbc connected excel spreadsheet and, after a few minutes, receives a response.  finally he uses an airprint printer located in his car to print out a full-color, 150-page report. he then turns to jack, hands him the report and says, “sir, you’ll see from the executive summary that you have exactly 1,586 cows and calves.“  “that’s right,” says jack. “i guess you can take one of my calves.“  jack then watches with amusement as the young man struggles to get the animal into the trunk of his car.  after a minute or two, jack says to the guy, “hey, if i can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me my calf back?“  the young man thinks for a second and then he says, “sure, why not?”  “you’re a congressman for the us government“, says jack.  “wow! that’s correct,” says the yuppie, “but how did you guess that?“  “no guessing required son,” jack responded. “you showed up here even though nobody called you; you want paying for an answer i already know; to a question i never asked. you used millions of dollars-worth of equipment trying to show me how smart you are; and you don’t know a thing about how ordinary, working people make a living, or about cows for that matter. if you did you’d know that this herd is actually a flock of sheep. now give me back my dog.”	3

"well," says the bus driver, "every night at 8 o'clock, she goes to the cemetery to pray. if you dress up as god, i'm sure you could convince her to have sex with you." the man decides to try it, and dresses up in his best god costume. at eight, he sees the nun and appears before her. "oh, god!" she exclaims. "take me with you!" the man tells the nun that she must first have sex with him to prove her loyalty. the nun says yes, but tells him she prefers anal sex. before you know it, they're getting down to it, having nasty, grunty, loud sex. after it's over, the man pulls off his god disguise. "ha, ha!" he says, "i'm the man from the bus!" "ha, ha!" says the nun, removing her costume, "i'm the bus driver!"	3

"boy, it sure is dark in here. it'd be a shame if i were to scream and let my dad know."   the man says, "what do you want this time?"    the boy walks away 100 dollars richer.  weeks later, they find themselves in the **same** closet in the same situation. this time, the boy requests 1,000 dollars.   "what?!? i don't have that kind of money!" snaps the man. " blackmail is just as wrong as cheating! you're catholic, right? go and confess to the priest.

"boy, it sure is dark in here. it would be a shame if i were to scream."   the priest sighs, then whispers "not this again."	1

oldie but goodie. there once was a small town, plagued with foo birds. these were small but loathsome things. harbingers of death, these birds were. wherever they poo’d there would be death. the townsfolk were afraid to walk under trees and power lines, in case they became a foo bird’s next victim.   well one day, a stranger came to town, riding in on the last greyhound bus. he was passing through, looking for work as a handyman. as he stood at the bus stop, you guessed it, a foo bird crapped all over his shoulder and down the front of his jacket.   with a tired sigh, and a resigned look to the heavens, the tired traveling handyman walked to his hotel, hoping to find work the next day.  as he entered the hotel, the clerks and manager all gasped at the sight of foo poo on the man’s clothes. knowing he only had hours left to live, they secretly  upgraded his room, and provided complimentary champagne. and as the traveling handyman made his way up the stairs with heavy footfalls echoing down the guilted staircase, the night clerk dialed the morgue, to make room for one more.   the next morning, the night clerk and manager were stunned to see the handyman eating breakfast at the hotel buffet wearing the same foo bird stained jacket. they warily approached the handyman, and asked how he managed to survive the night after being cursed by that infernal bird.   the handyman just shrugged, and said: “if the foo shits, wear it.”	1

"there's something wrong with my ear", he stated.   the receptionist nodded approvingly and smiled, knowing he had taken her advice. "and what is wrong with your ear, sir??"  "i can't piss out of it," he replied.  the waiting room erupted in laughter.   mess with seniors and you're gonna lose!	3

a few very important lessons you will learn only after you have kids a "king style" water bed contains enough water to turn a 200 sq m apartment into a 12 cm deep lake.  the voice of a 4 year old can deafen 200 normally talking adults in a crowded restaurant.   if you tie a dog leash to a room fan, the motor of the latter is not powerful enough to lift 23 kg youngster in a superman costume into the air. however, it is powerful enough to evenly cover the walls of a 7x7m room with paint from the jar in the hands of the "superman".  when the fan is turned on, baseballs should not be thrown at it.  the window glass, even double-glazed, is not an obstacle for a baseball hit by a fan blade.  if from the bathroom comes the noise of opening the toilet cabinet with your cosmetics, then the sound of glass and then a child's voice "oooops, but i ....", it's already too late.  breaks fluid mixed with chlorine-containing detergent, produces smoke. a lot of smoke.  a 4 year old can start fire with two stones, no matter how much we claim that this only happens in movies.  cement paste and microwave are intolerable.   super cement is super cement. even mixed by a 4 year old, it is forever. even if it is not on a convenient place.  no matter how much fruit jelly you pour into the pool, it does not allow you to walk on water.   pool filters don't like fruit jelly.  glass balls in the fuel tank make a very unpleasant noise while driving.   it is better if you don't try where that smell comes from.  you should always look inside the oven before turning it on. ovens are not particularly well suited to plastic toys.   it takes the fire department 6 minutes to get home.  the spin of the washing machine does not cause dizziness to earthworms.   the spin of the washing machine causes the cat to feel dizzy.   the cat can vomit almost as much as it weighs when dizzy.	2

"you have to spell a word", saint peter told her. "which word?" the woman asked. "love." the woman correctly spelled love and saint peter welcomed her into heaven. about three years later, saint peter came to the woman and asked her to watch the gates of heaven for him that day. while the woman was guarding the gates of heaven, her husband arrived.

best come back line ever.' police work must be entertaining as well as dangerous .  in summary, the police arrested patrick lawrence, 22 year old white male, in a pumpkin patch 12.01 a.m. on friday.  on monday, at the gwinnett county (ga) courthouse, lawrence was charged with lewd and lascivious behavior, public indecency, and public intoxication.  the suspect explained that as he was passing a pumpkin patch on his way home from a drinking session when he decided to stop, 'you know how a pumpkin is soft and squishy inside, and there was no one around for miles or at least i thought there wasn't anyone around' he stated in a telephone interview.  lawrence went on to say that he pulled over to the side of the road, picked out a pumpkin that he felt was appropriate to his purpose, cut a hole in it, and proceeded to satisfy his alleged need. 'guess i was really into it, you know?' he commented with evident embarrassment.  in the process of doing the deed, lawrence failed to notice an approaching police car and was unaware of his audience until officer brenda taylor approached him.  'it was an unusual situation, that's for sure,' said officer taylor. 'i walked up to lawrence and he's just banging away at this pumpkin.' officer taylor went on to describe what happened when she approached lawrence .  'i said, 'excuse me sir, but do you realize that you're having sex with a pumpkin??'  he froze and was clearly very surprised that i was there, and then he looked me straight in the face and said...

getting married in heaven on their way to get married, a young catholic couple is involved in a fatal car accident. the couple find themselves sitting outside the pearly gates waiting for st. peter to process them into heaven. while waiting, they begin to wonder: could they possibly get married in heaven? when st. peter showed up, they asked him.  st. peter said, 'i don't know. this is the first time anyone has asked. let me go find out,' and he leaves.  the couple sat and waited, and waited. two months passed and the couple are still waiting. while waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. after yet another month, st. peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.  'yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in heaven.'  'great!' said the couple, 'but we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? could we also get a divorce in heaven?'  st. peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'what's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.  'oh, come on!', st. peter shouted, 'it took me three months to find a priest up here! do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer ?	3

young timmy asks his mother a question. "mummy?" begins timmy  "yes, timmy?" she responds, a smile on her face.  "why do you jump up and down on daddy's tummy in bed at night?"  slightly shocked, she held her composure. "well, timmy, it's because i'm pushing all of the air out of daddy's tummy so that it doesn't look so big any more."  "oh," said timmy, looking confused.  "is there a problem, timmy?" asks his mother.  "yes, mummy. you shouldn't bother squashing daddy's tummy any more because aunt tracey comes over every morning when you're at work and keeps blowing it back up again."	3

a local business was looking for office help. they put a sign in the window saying: "help wanted. must be able to type, must be good with a computer and must be bilingual. we are an equal opportunity employer." a short time afterwards, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign and went inside. he looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then walked over to the sign, looked at it and whined. getting the idea, the receptionist got the office manager. the office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least. however, the dog looked determined, so he led him into the office.   inside, the dog jumped up on the chair and stared at the manager. the manager said, "i can't hire you. the sign says you have to be able to type." the dog jumped down, went to the typewriter and proceeded to type out a perfect letter. he took out the page and trotted over to the manager and gave it to him, then jumped back on the chair. the manager was stunned, but then told the dog, "the sign says you have to be good with a computer." the dog jumped down again and went to the computer. the dog proceeded to demonstrate his expertise with various programs and produced a sample spreadsheet and database and presented them to the manager. by this time the manager was totally dumbfounded! he looked at the dog and said, "i realize that you are a very intelligent dog and have some interesting abilities. however, i still can't give you the job." the dog jumped down and went to a copy of the sign and put his paw on the part about being an equal opportunity employer. the manager said, "yes, but the sign also says that you have to be bilingual."   the dog looked at him straight in the face and said, "meow."	3

was reminded of my dad’s favorite joke when i saw a similar joke posted earlier today. he owns his own construction company and would tell this to everyone. all the body parts get together to decide who is the boss of the body.  first is the brain. “it’s obvious i’m the boss. i’m the smartest and without me the body wouldn’t even know what to do.”  the hands speak up and say, “without us the body wouldn’t be able to get food to the mouth. the body couldn’t drive, use tools, etc.”  the feet go next and say, “well without us the body wouldn’t get anywhere. it couldn’t walk, dance, play sports.”  each body part gets a turn giving the reasons why they are the most important and should be the boss.  last to go is the asshole. it claims it is the boss and every other body part just laughs and makes fun of the asshole. “what do you do? you have the least important job.” so the asshole closes as tight as it can and lets nothing get by it.  after a few hours the other body parts are starting to feel weird but don’t concede that the asshole is the boss. close to a week passes and the feet are feeling weak, the hands can’t grab things as well, and the brain can’t think clearly. still, the asshole stays shut tight.  a few more days pass and all the other body parts can barely function at all. the body keeps falling because the feet can’t keep it up. it’s hungry because the hands can’t pick up food and the brain can’t even think straight.  finally all the body parts concede that the asshole is the most important body part. so the asshole opens up and everything soon returns to normal for the other body parts.   so to be the boss you don’t have to be smart, strong, or extremely useful. you just need to be an asshole.	1

new mower! a preacher was making his rounds to his parishioners on a bicycle, when he came upon a little boy trying to sell a lawn mower.  "how much do you want for the mower?" asked the preacher.  "i just want enough money to go out and buy me a bicycle," said the little boy.  after a moment of consideration, the preacher asked, "will you take my bike in trade for it?"  the little boy asked if he could try it out first, and, after riding the bike around a little while, said, "mister, you've got yourself a deal."  the preacher took the mower and began to crank it.  he pulled on the rope a few times with no response from the mower.  the preacher called the little boy over and said, "i can't get this mower to start."  the little boy said, "that's because you have to cuss at it to get it started."  the preacher said, i'm a minister, and i can't cuss. it's been so long since i've been saved that i don't even remember how to cuss."  the little boy looked at him happily and said, "you just keep pulling on that rope. it'll come back to ya!"	1

one day, einstein has to speak at an important science conference. on the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him:      "i'm sick of all these conferences. i always say the same things over and over!"  the driver agrees: "you're right. as your driver, i attended all of them, and even though i don't know anything about science, i could give the conference in your place."      "that's a great idea!" says einstein. "let's switch places then!"      so they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.      but in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. so this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. the whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.      the driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :   "sir, your question is so easy to answer that i'm going to let my driver reply to it for me."	3

one evening an old farmer decided to go down to the pond. (long) the pond was at the edge of his land and his body wasn't as it used to be, so he hardly went to that part of his property but he decided he wanted to look it over. there were fruit trees surrounding the pond so before he left home, he grabbed a five-gallon bucket to bring some fruit back with him.  as he neared the pond, he heard laughter and shouting. when he got around the trees and bushes, he saw it was a group of young women skinny dipping in his pond. he shouted out so that they could see he was there. after they saw him, they started shrieking and moved to the deep end.  one of the women shouted at the old man, "we're not coming out until you leave, perv!".  the old man frowned and said, "now, i didn't come here to watch you ladies swim naked or make you get out of the pond naked." then, holding the bucket up and smiling, he said, "no, nothing like that. i'm just here to feed the alligator."	3

a mother is concerned that her son isn't making enough money on his own, so she asks what he will do for a living and he says he won't have a real job, but he has found a legal loophole to take advantage of the sketchy business practices in his city; he discovered many of the repossession companies in his city didn't fill out the proper paperwork before taking a car away.   so he would buy a new car on loan and intentionally not make the payments. when the repossession company would come, he would let them take it, and then threaten to sue them in court. he would rough himself up a little bit, and the company would settle outside of court; they would pay for the car to avoid getting a negative reputation.  "that's smart son, but what makes you think you'll be successful here?"  "that's easy. repo sting for car, ma!"	3

"well," he says, "i figure the job will run  about $900: $400 for materials, $400 for my crew and $100 profit for me."  the  tennessee contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says,  "i can do this job for $700: $300 for materials, $300 for my crew and  $100 profit for me."  the new york contractor doesn't measure or  figure, but leans over to the white house official and whispers,  "$2,700." the official, incredulous, says, "you didn't even measure like  the other guys! how did you come up with such a high figure?" the new  york contractor whispers back, "$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire  the guy from tennessee to fix the fence."

so a cruise ship sinks... so a cruise ship sinks in the middle of the pacific and three guys find themselves stranded on a desert island after being adrift in a life raft for a week.   after being on the island for a couple days a plane flies overhead and sees their sos on the beach. with their supplies almost exhausted they start to search the island for food and water while they wait for the rescue to arrive and come across an old oil lamp. as a joke one guy syas to the others "maybe if we rub it a genie will pop out" and gives it a quick buff with his sleeve. low and behold to their surprise a genie really does appear and offers them each 3 wishes for freeing him.  so the first guy says "for my first wish i want 5 billion dollars!" the genie snaps his fingers and tells him that its done. the second guy yells out "i want to be the richest man alive" and the genie again snaps his fingers and tells the man that he is now richer than bill gates. the third guy takes his time and after much humming and hawing says to the genie "i wish that my left arm was constantly rotating clockwise." the genie thinking that this is a very odd request asks if he's sure and the guy reaffirms his wish so the genie snaps his fingers and the guy's left arm starts to rotate clockwise.  for his second wish the first guy asks for the "the hottest wife in the world." and the genie snaps his fingers and bombshell appears on the mans arm. seeing this the second guy wishes "to be able to sleep with any person he wants" so the genie snaps his fingers and the second guy beckons to the first's new wife. the third guy acter more humming and hawing finally says "i wish my right arm was constantly rotating counter-clockwise." again the genie questions him if that really is his wish before snapping his fingers and the man's right arm begins rotate the opposite way of his left.  going back to the first guy the genie asks him for his third and final wish to which the man states that he wants to be the president of the united states. so the genie snaps his fingers and tells him that as soon as his feet touch the ground back in the us that he will be sworn in as president. moving on to the second guy the genie begins to ask what his second wish is but the guy cuts hims off and demands unlimited political power. the genie angrily snaps his fingers, tells him that it is done and the second guy begins telling the first how to run the country when they get back. the third guy again is humming and hawing and seeing the rescue boat drawing near says "i wish my head was constantly nodding up and down." the genie really doesn't see why the third guy keeps making these strange wishes and again asks if he is 100% sure that's what he wants and the man says yes. so the genie snaps his fingers and the man's head begins to nod up and down.  at this point the rescue boat has pulled into shore so they three guys board it and one the way home agree to meet again in five years to see how each is getting on in life after their incredible experience.   five years later they all meet again and the first guy says "life is good. i got re-elected for a second term as president, i'm still super rich and my wife is still the hottest woman on the planet." the second guy tells them "life is great. i'm still the richest man alive, get to tell the first guy what to do and sometimes i bang his super hot wife."   now both guys turn to the third who's arms are still rotating and his head is still nodding up and down and he tells them "you know what guys? i think i fucked up."	1

priest and the camera  twice a week the local parish priest liked to go up on the roof of the rectory and crank one out. he had decided that this was probably the most discreet and secure place he could be and not be discovered. one day a tourist on a nearby tower was taking pictures of the city landscape and noticed the priest pleasuring himself, he quickly took a number of pictures. the next day he went to the church and asked to see the priest. the priest's secretary introduced them and they went back to his office to talk. he asked the priest if he was interested in photography because he might have a really nice camera for sale. the priest replied that he was not that interested at which point the man laid out several 8x10 glossy prints of the priest in all his glory vigorously choking the chicken. "any interest now?" the man exclaimed. "how much?" the priest asked embarrassingly, "$5000", the man replied, and the priest begrudgingly paid the money and put the camera up on a shelf behind him. later that day the secretary came into the office to ask a question when she noticed the camera. "that's a nice camera father, i didn't even know you were into photography. do you mind me asking how much you paid for it?", "$5000" the priest replied. "wow!", she responded, "they must have seen you coming!"	2

a middle aged man was walking home one friday . instead of taking his company bus he decided to walk up the mountain road ,see the beautiful sunset and take a train on the other side. his time calculation went wrong and it became dark ,he was still on the inclined mountain road .while walking hurriedly he noticed shadow of a man standing near a dim incandescent lamp post .by his standing posture he looked like an old man. he was wearing a baggy cloak seem to have made a century ago. he was holding a book in his hand . the middle aged man tried to engage in a conversation by asking the time .the old man nodded in a way showing he doesn't know and doesn't care. the man couldn't resist and asked "what are you holding there". the old man answered "it's the last thing a mortal should own". amused by this statement the man asked more about the book to which the old man answered "the owner of this book becomes rich and gets everything he wants" . the man got interested and asked the old man to sell him that book. the old man said "10,000 dollars" . the man being highly superstitious paid the price and bought the book. as he was leaving down the mountain road the old man stopped him to warn about the book saying "whatever you do with it ,never open the last page ,or you will die". the man left rather happily inspite of the warning. from that day forward the man quit his job , bought a big villa and a sports car on loan and mortgage from his smaller house. he waited for his days to change and started day dreaming about more expensive things thinking the book will show its magic. but that never happened. after being in debt for years he finally lost his patience and decided to take a look at the last page of the book. he slowly opened the book and saw all pages were empty .he never looked at the pages before as he was only interested in the outcome of owning the book. fearing for his life he opened the last page and died instantly of cardiac arrest. the last page said "hard bound ,unruled. $8.99"	1

"today and tomorrow", the blonde answers. the chief is again surprised that the blonde has supplied an answer that's not entirely wrong. "now listen carefully, who killed abraham lincoln?" he asks her. the blonde looks a little surprised.  she thinks really hard for a minute and finally admits, "i don't know."

speed demon grandma ethel was a bit  of a demon in her wheelchair, and loved to charge around the nursing home,  taking corners on one wheel and getting up to maximum speed on the long  corridors. because the poor woman was one sandwich short of a picnic the other  residents tolerated her and some of them actually joined in.   one day  ethel was speeding up one corridor when a door opened and kooky clarence stepped  out with his arm outstretched. "stop!" he shouted in a firm voice. "have you got  a license for that thing?" ethel fished around in her handbag and pulled out a  kit kat wrapper and held it up to him. "ok," he said, and away ethel sped down  the hall.   as she took the corner near the tv lounge on one wheel, weird  harold popped out in front of her and shouted "stop! have you got proof of  insurance?" ethel dug into her handbag, pulled out a drink coaster and held it  up to him. harold nodded and said "on your way, ma'am."   as ethel neared  the final corridor, crazy craig stepped out in front of her, butt- naked, and  holding his "you-know- what" in his hand. "oh, good grief," yelled ethel,  "not that damn breathalyzer test again!!!"	2

in german prisoner-of-war camps, escapes were a a major problem. the officers would try to break the prisoners’ spirits by making them do mindless things. in particular, they would make the prisoners stand in a line and all move their heads like a clock back and forth and say, ‘tick tock tick tock.’  some prisoners, unable to escape or otherwise change their situation, chose a very subtle rebellion. they would do the head motions, but instead of ‘tick tock tick tock’, they would wait until the guards were further down the line and switch to ‘tick tick tick.’  none of the guards noticed this was going on for many months, until finally, a young lieutenant was caught ticking by a senior ss captain walking behind the line.  the captain stopped the exercise, walked over, face-to-face with the young man, and "a rebel. vell, don’t vorry, ve have vays of making you tock.’	2

"man we should go home now. i'm getting exhausted. i'm tired, my neck hurts from all of this pretend blowing i'm doing. i think i'm done."  the guy with the hot dogs says, "you think you got it bad? i ran out of hot dogs 3 bars ago!"	3

my neighbour used to sell ukranian eggs.  if you don't know what those are, it's when you draw on eggs with wax and then soak them in coloured dyes to create special designs. it's an art form called pysanky - you should look it up.     he used to sell them out of a little stall in his front garden. i never really saw many people buy them, but i figured it was just a hobby and didn't think too much about it. i once asked him what he did for a living.     "eggs," he said. "i sell ukranian eggs."     for context, he drove a fancy car, took long holidays to exotic places, and generally seemed to be quite well off, so i was pretty surprised to hear he made all his money off of selling little dyed eggs out of his garden. they must have fetched pretty high prices...     one day i got home and there were police all around my neighbour's house. they'd arrested him. turns out he'd been money laundering.     that egg stand? it was a shell corporation.	1

so this is a story i found and wanted to share it with whoever clicks on this a mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate..... during the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was.she had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious....  over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye. reading his mom's thoughts, his son volunteered, “i know what you must be thinking, but i assure you,we are just roommates."  about a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “ever since your mother came to dinner, i've been unable to find the silver plate. you don't suppose she took it, do you?"  he said ,"well, i doubt it, but i'll email her, just to be sure." he sat down and wrote :  dear mother: i'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, i'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate but the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.  love, your son.  several days later, he received an email from his mother which read:  dear son: i'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and i'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her. but the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under her pillow… love, mom.	2

the outmaneuvre ! an airbus 380 is on its way across the atlantic. it flies consistently at 800 km/h in 30,000 feet, when suddenly a eurofighter with tempo mach 2 appears. the pilot of the fighter jet slows down, flies alongside the airbus and greets the pilot of the passenger plane by radio: "airbus flight, boring flight isn’t it? take care and have a look here!”  he rolls his jet on its back, accelerates, breaks through the sound barrier, rises rapidly to a dizzying height, only to swoop down almost to sea level in a breathtaking dive. he loops back next to the airbus and asks, "well, how was that?"  the airbus pilot answers: "very impressive, but now have a look here!"  the jet pilot watches the airbus, but nothing happens. it continues to fly stubbornly straight, with the same speed. after five minutes, the airbus pilot radioed, "well, what are you saying now?"  the jet pilot asks confused: "what did you do?"   the other laughs and says, "i got up, stretched my legs, went to the back of the flight to the bathroom, got a cup of coffee and a cinnamon cake and made an appointment with the stewardess for the next three nights - in a 5 star hotel, which is paid for by my employer !!

fred and charlie had been having a few beers at the bar together when suddenly they both had to take a piss.  standing next to each other at the urinal, fred could hardly ignore the fact that charlie was very well endowed.  "i say, that's a remarkable donger you have there old boy,” remarked fred.  "wasn't always that way,” replied charlie, “medical science can do wonders with transplants these days. i got this done over in new york. cost a thousand bucks, but as you can see, well worth every cent.”  fred was very envious. in fact, he packed his bag that night and flew to new york first thing in the morning.  it was a good six months later before he ran into his old friend once again and fred could hardly wait to tell him that he had taken his advice and was well pleased with the result.  "but charlie, i’ve got to tell you something else" said fred. "you were cheated! i got mine for $500, not a thousand.”  charlie could hardly believe it. same address in new york, same doctor. complaining that he had been ripped off, he asked fred if he could take a look.  once more they lined up at the porcelain, but when charlie took a peek over the partition his worried disappeared. "no wonder," he laughed “that's my old one!"	3

a woman brought a very limp duck in to a veterinary surgeon. as she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the duck's chest.  after a moment or two, the vet shook his head sadly and said, “i’m sorry, your duck cuddles, has passed away.”  the distressed woman wailed, “are you sure?”  “yes, i am sure. the duck is dead,” replied the vet.  “how can you be so sure?” she protested. “i mean you haven’t done any testing on him or anything. he might just be in a coma or something.”  the vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room.  he returned a few minutes later with a labrador.  as the duck’s owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. he then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.  the vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room.  a few minutes later he returned with a cat. the cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. the cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.  the vet looked at the woman and said, “i’m sorry, but as i said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.”  the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman.  the duck’s owner, still in shock, took the bill. “$1000!” she cried, “$1000 just to tell me my duck is dead!”  the vet shrugged, “i’m sorry. if you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the lab report and the cat scan, it’s now $1000."	3

a chemistry professor posted a bonus question on an exam. is hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?  most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using boyle's law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.  one student, however, wrote the following:  first, we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time. so we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into hell and the rate at which they are leaving. i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. therefore, no souls are leaving.  as for how many souls are entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to hell.  with birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because boyle's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the volume of hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.  this gives two possibilities:  if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose.  if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over.  so which is it?  if we accept the postulate given to me by teresa during my freshman year that, "it will be a cold day in hell before i sleep with you", and take into account the fact that i slept with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus i am sure that hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.  the corollary of this theory is that since hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore extinct . . . leaving only heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being, which explains why last night teresa kept shouting "oh, my god!"  this student received the only "a".	3

"jesus you're a man!!!!" he screams.   lucy calmly says "no,i just decided to take a shit too"	3

i dont have any regrets for what i did last year.... it's my humble request to read this calmly before making an opinion about me. and i tell you all again. i have no regret for what i have done.   when i was about 17 or 18, i first noticed that my sister was a hottie. first of all, - just for some background: my mum died right when i was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. i guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) i actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before i was born. so you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.  anyways, growing up i feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. when i was about 17 or 18 i first noticed that my sister was a hottie.  i don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that i accidentally found a video that she made of herself. i knew she didn't make it for me- but i thought she was so fucking beautiful that i watched it twice. i probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time i found the video, all this crazy shit went down and i had to leave home. (my dad's family who i was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. i never talk about it).  sooo... i was totally lusting after my sister at that point. she was also having bad trouble with the law. she was actually in custody when i left home.  my friend and i went to go pick her up. when i saw her that day, after seeing the video, i have to be honest, i just wanted to fuck her brains out. looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but i think she had feelings for me too. she actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? i mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.  after we left, we all went to crash with my sister's friends. on the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my sister, and i got a little jealous. he's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- i just felt like he was competition. not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. i'm not saying that i'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.  my friend and my sister never hooked up i don't think- but i thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. it was around that time that i got really badly hurt in an accident. it was fucked up. i almost died. but when i was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.  sadly (although, i guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. we spent some time apart... and i started to get really religious, so i tried not to think of her that way. it was actually going well for a long time- like i was totally over her.  but i have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini i've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. sigh.  a little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). i can't say i was surprised. but even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and i were outside alone.  it was a really intimate moment. i think something might have happened, except that i killed the mood when i told her that darth vader was our father and that i had to go face him.	1

two men in the woods two old friends are walking through the woods, catching up after not seeing one another in a long time. after awhile they come upon a vast deep hole in the ground. perplexed and inquisitive, they look for something to toss down. they find a rusted old anvil and shove it in. it disappears into the darkness, not even a thud.   suddenly, they hear a commotion behind them. a goat is running full sprint through the woods, trampling bushes. it runs by, almost knocking them over, and jumps headfirst down the hole.  before they can even process what they've witnessed they hear a man running and screaming.   "hey boys, did you see a goat run by here?"       "yeah we did, he jumped straight into this hole here"  "thats impossible! i had him chained to an anvil"	2

good trade !  i remember once when i was driving home from one of my business trips through northern arizona, when i saw an elderly navajo man walking on the side of the road. as the trip was a long and quiet one, i stopped the car and asked the navajo man if he'd would like a ride. with a word or two of thanks, he got in the car. after resuming the journey and a bit of small talk, the navajo man noticed a brown bag on the seat next to me. "what's in the bag?" asked the old man. i looked down at the brown bag and said, "it's a bottle of wine. got it for my wife." the navajo man was silent for a moment, and then speaking with the quiet wisdom of an elder said, "good trade."	3

foolproof: how i became a billionnaire in just 15 days. you can do it too. when my wife and i got married we only got 0.50$ of combined wealth.  i was wandering around in the fruit market in desperation, that was when i saw an apple for 50 cents. i was so hungry that i spent our 50 cents in a blink of an eye. on one apple.  but then it hit me: what have i done? i spent all our family savings on one stupid apple!   feeling horrible, i went ahead and cleaned up the apple: with the hopes that the seller will buy it back from me.  he saw the apple and said: wow, that's such a nice apple. i'd give you a dollar for that.  that was my a-ha moment, grasshoppers.   i took that dollar and bought 2 dirty apples with it. cleaned them very well for an hour, and sold them for 2 dollars.  i was off to races.  in 14 days my business performed beyond wildest expectations: i netted a solid 256$.  then on the 15th day the uncle of my wife in dubai passed away and left us two billion dollars of cash inheritance.	3

"so did you run?"  "of course dad! the next day we were to learn swimming techniques. we had to swim five miles nonstop, or the next day we would have to swim 10."  "so did ya swim it?"  "of course dad! the next day we had to do sky diving. well you know i'm deathly scared of heights. so the drill sergeant said if i didn't jump out of that plane asap he had a baseball bat he carried for these occasions. he said if i didn't jump on the count not five he'd shove it up my ass!"

five gangsters walk past a local diner the owner runs out the door and up to them saying, "excuse me, i've got a problem and you're the only ones who can solve it!"  the gangsters look at each other confused and ask, "what, why us man?"  "i'll explain later, just come with me!" the owner replies. the curious gangsters follow the owner into the diner, and then they enter the kitchen. in the back, a man is furiously scrubbing metal pots and pans so hard that he's damaging them.  the owner points at the man and says, "my new dishwasher guy is scrubbing the dishes too hard! he's scratching them up and refusing to stop! at this rate, i'm going to have to replace all my dishes!"  one of the gangsters rolls his eyes and says to another gangster, "yo g, i got this."   the gangster taps the dishwasher on the shoulder and says, "dude, ease up on those dishes."  but the man keeps scrubbing. another one of the gangsters says, "that won't do it, g," and he tries to spin the dishwasher around to face them, but the dishwasher man won't budge. "c'mon idiot, ease up on those dishes!"  but the man is still scrubbing. the third and fourth gangsters try shouting in the man's ears, "ease up on those damn dishes!"  but the man scrubs away. finally, the fifth gangster has had enough and start pulling on the dishwasher to get him away from the sink and the dishes. another g joins in, followed by the rest, pulling as hard as they can.  but it's no use, and they all fall to the floor exhausted while the dishwasher keeps scrubbing, no sign of easing up on the poor dishes.  the owner is shocked and shakes his head in disbelief, "i can't believe it, i was sure this would work."  the fifth gangster looks at him exasperated and says, "dude, why the hell did you think this would work? what can five gangsters do against a dishwasher who's basically superman?"  the owner replies, "i know it sounded crazy and i had no evidence to prove it, but i really thought that 5gs could cause dish ease."	3

an old farmer is sitting on his front porch ... an old farmer is sitting on his front porch early one morning when he sees the neighbor's kid walking up the dirt road. the farmer notices the boy is carrying something. "hey boy,” the farmer says. “whatcha got there?"  "this here is some chicken wire. i’m gonna go catch some chickens!”  "you damn fool,” the old farmer replied. “you can't catch chickens with chicken wire.” the boy shrugs and keeps on walking.   around noon, the boy returns — sure enough, he has about 30 chickens caught in the chicken wire. the old farmer can’t believe his eyes.  the next morning, the old man sees the boy again. he’s carrying something, but it’s not chicken wire. "hey boy, whatcha got there?” the farmer asks.  "duct tape. i’m gonna go catch me some ducks."  the farmer recalls yesterday’s events with the chicken wire, but he’s absolutely positive the kid won’t be able to catch ducks with duct tape, so he doubles down: “listen boy,” the farmer shouts. “you can't catch ducks with duct tape!"  the boy just laughs and keeps walking. after a few hours, the boy returns and he has about 30 ducks wrapped in a long trail of duct tape. the farmer is beside himself. he can’t believe what he’s seeing.   the next morning, the old man sees the boy walking up the dirt road with a bunch of branches under his arms. "hey boy,” the farmer says, “watcha got there?"  "this here is pussy willow,”  "wait up," says the old man. "i'll go get my hat!"	3

there was once a woman called patricia whack she worked in a bank and generally dealt with secured loans. one day she calls for her next appointment when a  frog hops into the room and sits on the chair opposite her. confused, she asks "can i help you?" "yes," says the frog "kermit jagger, i'm here for a loan, uh 100k please" patty is taken aback, she hadn't really expected the frog to respond. "well, for something like that we'd need some serious collateral to secure against, what, did you have in mind?" the frog produces a small, exquisite, porcelain pig and pushes it towards her "this should cover it." patty picks up the pig and turns it over slowly in her hand completely perplexed. the frog pipes up "look i know this is a bit strange but it's all fine my dad's mick jagger, he's friends with the bank manager. check if you like." patty goes to her manager and tells them the situation showing him the porcelain pig. "i don't know what to do," she says to her manager, gesturing to the pig she adds "i mean, what even is this?"  the manager looks carefully at the pig then turns to patricia and says "it's a knick-knack patty whack, give the frog a loan; his old man's a rolling stone"	1

a politician dies… and ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. saint peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.      “so, you’re a politician…” “well, yes, is that a problem?” “oh no, no problem. but we’ve recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in hell. after that however, you’re free to choose where you want to spend eternity!”      “wait, i have to spend a day in hell??” says the politician. “them’s the rules” says st peter, clicks his fingers, and woomph, the guy dissapears… and awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he’s in hell. cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds… nothing. just the smell of, is that fabric softener? and cut grass, this can’t be right?      “open your eyes!” says a voice. “c'mon, wakey wakey, we’ve only got 24 hours!”. nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he’s in a hotel room. a nice one too. wait, this is a penthouse suite… and there’s a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. “who are you??” the politician asks. “well, i’m satan!” says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. “welcome to hell!” “wait, this is hell? but… where’s all the pain and suffering?” he asks. satan throws him a wink. “oh, we’ve been a bit mis-represented over the years, it’s a long story. anyway, this is your room! the minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there’s extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. but enough of this! it’s a beautiful day, and if you’d care to look outside…” slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. “it’s one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there’s another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!” says satan, answering his unasked question. so they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. and as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he’s admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he’s admired but died long before his career started. and out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. he spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with marylin monroe). as everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear… and they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. after 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep… and is woken up by st peter. “so, that was hell. wasn’t what you were expecting, i bet?” “no sir!” says the man. “so then” says st peter “you can make your choice. it’s hell, which you saw, or heaven, which has choral singing, talking to god, white robes, and so on”. “well… i know this sounds strange, but on balance, i think i’d prefer hell” says the politician. “not a problem, we totally understand! enjoy!” says st peter, and clicks his fingers again.      the man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. as he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. a sudden bolt of lightning reveals satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. “what’s this??” he cries. “where’s the hotel?? where’s my wife??? where’s the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???”      “ah”, says satan. “you see, yesterday, we were campaigning. but today, you voted…”	3

sylvester stallone and arnold schwarzenegger are talking to each other about their long careers as action heroes. sly says, "you did some okay comedy, but you have the governorship and political success to be proud of."  arnold says, "you've had so much recognition in hollywood. i've never been nominated for an oscar, you have have been three times. i wish i could be taken seriously as an actor."  they think about it for a few minutes, and stallone says, "we should do a serious film. a historical."  arnold grins his huge toothy grin, immediately warming to the idea. "a period piece. that's a great way for our acting comebacks to be taken seriously."  stallone, as the film auteur, keeps working on it. "we want people to be emotionally affected by it. music really moves people. can we do something about music?"  schwarzenegger agrees. "we could do classical music. you're italian; you could play an italian composer."  sylvester says, "i'll play vivaldi!"  arnold schwarzenegger says, "i'll be bach."	3

a new pastor was visiting the homes of his parishioners. at one house it seemed obvious that someone was at home, but no answer came to his repeated knocks at the door. therefore, he took out a card and wrote "revelation 3:20" on the back of it and stuck it in the door. when the offering was processed the following sunday, he found that his card had been returned. added to it was this cryptic message, genesis 3:10." reaching for his bible to check out the citation, he broke up in gales of laughter. revelation 3:20 begins "behold, i stand at the door and knock." genesis 3:10 reads, "i heard your voice in the garden and i was afraid, for i was naked."	2

a man takes the day off of work to go golfing    a man takes the day off work to go out golfing. he is on the second hole when he notices a frog sitting next to the green.  &#x200b;  he thinks nothing of it and is about to shoot when he hears, "ribbit, 9 iron."    the man looks around and doesn't see anyone.    "ribbit, 9 iron."    he looks at the frog and decides to prove the frog wrong, puts his club away and grabs his 9 iron. boom! he hits it 10 inches from the cup. he is shocked. he says to the frog, "wow, that's amazing. you must be a lucky frog, eh?"    the frog replies, "ribbit, lucky frog."    the man decides to take the frog with him to the next hole. "what do you think, frog?" the man asks.    "ribbit, 3 wood."    he takes out a 3 wood and wham!, hole in one. the man is befuddled and doesn't know what to say. by the end of the day, the man golfed the best game of golf in his life and asks the frog, "ok, where to next?"    the frog replies, "ribbit, las vegas." they arive at las vegas at a casino. he says, "ok frog, now what?"  &#x200b;  the frog says, "ribbit, roulette."    upon approaching the roulette table, the man asks, "what do you think i should bet?"    the frog replies, "ribbit, $300,000, black, 6."    now, this is a million-to-one shot to win, but after the golf game, he figures what the heck.whoosh! tons of cash comes sliding back across the table. the man uses some of his winnings to pay for the best hotel room he can find "frog, i don't know how to repay you. you've won me all this money, and i am forever grateful."    the frog replies, "ribbit, kiss me."    he figures, why not? since after all the frog did for him, he deserves it. with a kiss, the frog turns into a 15-year-old girl.    "and that, your honnor, is how she ended up in my room."	2

"well, he is 5344 years old, he lived of berries, vegetables and occasionally some meat. his name was golunk and he lived in an ancient city which is long gone. he used the stick to fight of wild beasts which were vast at that time. he also had eight kids and three wives and the artefacts were a gift for his oldest son's wedding.".  the professor was stunned over the precision and so were his students. they knew kgb had resources, but at this level.. one of the students asked the officer how they were able to pin-point the information at this granularity?  "he confessed!", said the officer.	1

a boogie board was abandoned in a man-made lake. days or maybe even weeks go by without it interacting with anyone or anything.  it drifts mindlessly around, because no one is there to direct it. it starts to day dream about a time where it wasn't alone in a glorified pond.  a few more weeks go by of this boring life, when it suddenly feels the current pick up beneath it.  it drifts faster towards some pull until it eventually hits a cement wall.  it thinks, "finally! someone to talk to!" so the it decides to start a conversation, but the wall never responds.  eventually, it realizes that the wall probably wasn't interested in talking back.  he thinks of moving on, but wants to tell his friend that he's going to do so, so he turns to the wall and says, "dam, i'm board."	1

a woman is standing on the edge of the verrazzano bridge ready to jump as she's working up the courage to take the last step off, a sailor walks by and sees her. he says, "ma'am, i can't pretend to know what you're going through but i promise it isn't worth this. tomorrow my ship leaves for rome. why don't i sneak you on and when we get there we can run off and start a life together?"     well this woman has always wanted to see rome and she was about to kill herself anyway so she figures she has absolutely nothing to lose. she takes his hand and goes with him back to his ship and he hides her in a very small but very comfortable compartment. every evening he brings her food and the two of them bump nasties until the sun comes up. this goes on for about three weeks before the captain finally stumbles across her. when he asks her what she's doing there she tells him, "one of your sailors snuck me aboard. we're going to run off and get married once we get to rome. plus.....he's fucking me."     the captain says, "lady, you're god damn right he's fucking you. this is the staten island ferry."	1

a man is in court (long but worth it)  judge: "you are accused of beating your wife to death. if you want to expect any mercy, you'll have to give us a damn good reason." man: "she was so stupid, i just had to kill her." judge: "that is even worse. if you don't want to be declared guilty on the spot, you better give us a plausible reason." man: well it happened like this. we live in this apartment complex and the property manager lives in the first floor with his family. the kids all have a growth deficiency. so one day, my wife comes up and says: those little kids, they look like pyrenees. so i say: you mean pygmy. "no", says my wife. pygmy is what you have under your skin, it causes freckles. "that's pigment", i say. so she says "no, pigment is what the ancient romans were writing on." i sigh and say: "no, that's parchment!". "no", says she, "parchment is an unfinished sentence". "your honor, you can imagine, i swallowed the 'fragment', i got back to my armchair and my newspaper. but then suddenly she's back with a book, and she says:  i should know, i got a legionnaire for my french lessons. i say: "you mean a lector". "no", says my wife, "lector was an ancient greek hero." i say: "that was hector, and he was a trojan." "nope", says she, "hector is a measure of area." "that'd be hectare" "no! hectare is the drink of the gods!" "that'd be nectar". "no", says she, "the nectar is a river in southern germany." so i say: "that's the neckar." she says: "no, i must know, there's even a song about it. i recently sung it in a duo with my friend" i say: "it's a duet" she replies, "no, that's when two men are fighting with a saber." "that's a duel", i say. "no, a duel is where a railway goes through a mountain!" well, your honor, so i took a hammer and beat her to death... there was a long silence, shocked faces.  finally the judge says: not guilty. i would have killed her at "hector".	3

so a 17 year old kid just got a job at a everything-plus kind of store. the manager tells him that he needs to sell at least $500 of their products per week. the manager comes a week later and asks the kid how much he made, and the kid says he made $100,000. the manager asks how he did it. so the kid says that a man came in on friday needing some fishing lures, so he sold him the most expensive pack of lures. he then said to the man “ you’ll need a good fishing rod for those lures you got there.” so he sold him their most expensive rod. the kid then said to the man. “ you know that you’ll need a good boat for all the fishing gear you have.” so he sold him an expensive pro fishing boat. the kid then says “ you’ll need a trailer to take the boat to the lake.” so he sold him a trailer. then the kid says “ i saw you come here in your little civic, but you’ll need a good truck to move that trailer.” so he sold him a truck. the manager then says “ so you sold this man $100,000 worth of fishing equipment, when he was just getting lures?!?” the kid then says “ no no no, he was coming in to get tampons for his wife and i told him ‘ bud your weekend’s fucked, you need to go fishing!’”  edit: i changed it back to 100,000	3

so there was this man in bulgaria who drove trains for a living. he loved his job. driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. he loved to make the train go as fast as possible. unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. he made it out, but a single person died. well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. he was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. when the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. after eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. the man was perfectly fine.    well, at the time, there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. the trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. for his final meal, the man requested two bananas. after eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.    well, this of course meant that he was free to go. and once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. to what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. on the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.    "you know what? no," said the executioner. "i've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. i'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now." well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. the switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. the executioner was speechless.   the man looked at the executioner and said, "oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. i'm just a bad conductor."	3

a senior citizen drove his corvette out of the dealership taking off down the road, he floored it to 80 mph, enjoying the wind through what litter hair he still had left. amazing, he thought as he flew down i-94, pushing the peddle even more.  looking at his rear view mirror, he saw a state trooper behind him, flashing his lights and siren blaring. he floored it to 100, 110, and finally 120 mph. suddenly he thought, i’m too old for this, and pulled over to the side of the road.   the trooper walked up to the old man’s window, looked at his watch, and said “sir, my shift ends in 30 minutes so if you can give me a reason for speeding that i haven’t heard before, i’ll let you go.”  the old gentleman paused, then said, “years ago, my wife ran off with a state trooper. i thought you were bringing her back!”  “have a good day, sir”, replied the trooper.	2

students in a college final exam were nearing the end of the testing period... "all pencils down, turn in your tests, put them in a stack on my desk" ordered the professor to the class of 200 students.  almost every student put their pencil down except for one student who was adding to their last answer. when the other students had handed in their tests the late student walked up to the professor's desk.  "you failed" exclaimed the teacher. "you didn't put down your pencil in time and you have failed this test."  suddenly the late student became indignant. "do you know who i am?! do you know who i am?!"  "frankly, i do not nor do i care" the professor countered.  so the late student stuck his test into the middle of the stack of papers and walked out of the room.	1

the texas department of transportation (txdot) found over 200 dead crows on highway 281 this past week, and there was concern that they may have died from the coronavirus. a veterinary epidemiologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was not coronavirus (covid-19).   the cause of death was actually from vehicular impacts. however, during analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. by analyzing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorcycles, while only 2% were killed by cars.  txdot then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorcycle kills versus car kills.   the ornithological behaviorist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger.   they discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout "cah", not a single one could shout "bike"!!!	1

a wealthy businessman retired to a remote area since he would be alone most of the time, he wanted a place with great security. he finally found a place that fit the bill— high compound walls, cameras, motion detectors, and a panic room all monitored remotely by a security company 24/7. the businessman bought the place and, just to be sure, brought in his own security expert to inspect things. the expert was impressed with the security system save one overlooked detail: an old sewer grate inside the compound that allowed unmonitored subterranean access from outside.     the businessman immediately called the security company to have additional cameras and motion sensors placed on the grate and tunnels, but they informed him that they wouldn’t have an installer available for several days. worried, he asked the expert what to do. the expert said that he could run some electricity from a nearby security camera to the metal grate to zap any intruders. while it wasn’t a long-term solution, the expert said it would give the businessman some peace of mind for a few days until the security company installer arrived. the businessman approved of this plan, and it was quickly done.     the following night when the businessman was in bed he heard a great commotion. officers from the security company descended on the compound from all directions and arrested a thief who had been attempting to enter through the grate. confused, the businessman asked how they had been able to respond so quickly since the grate was still unmonitored. after some looking around, the security company determined that when the thief had touched the grate it had disrupted the current to the security camera the expert had wired into, triggering an alarm.   which just goes to show that with grate power comes grate response ability.	2

blonde and the insemination man a blonde city girl named amy marries a  colorado rancher. one morning, on his way out to check on the cows,  the rancher says to amy, "the insemination man is coming over to impregnate one of our cows, so i drove a nail into the 2x4 just above where the cow's stall is in the barn. please show him where the cow is when he gets here, ok?" the rancher leaves for the fields. after a while, the artificial insemination man arrives and knocks on the front door. “i came to inseminate the cow,” he said. amy takes him down to the barn. they walk along the row of cows, and when amy sees the nail, she tells him, "this is the one right here." the man, assuming he is dealing with an airhead blonde, asks, "tell me, lady, 'cause i'm dying to know. how would you know that this is the right cow to be bred?" "that's simple," she said. "by the nail that's over its stall," she explains very confidently.  laughing rudely at her, the man says, "and what, pray tell, is the  nail for?" the blonde turns to walk away and says sweetly over her  shoulder, “i guess it’s to hang your pants on,” she replied.	3
a young family moved into a house... next to a vacant lot. one day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.  the young family's 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers.  eventually the construction crew, all of them "gems-in-the-rough" more or less, had adopted her as a kind of project mascot. they chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. at the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.  the little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars "pay" she'd received to the bank the next day to start a savings account.  when the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own pay check at such a young age. the little girl proudly replied: "i worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us."  "oh my goodness gracious," said the teller, "and will you be working on the house again this week, too?"  the little girl replied, "i will, if those assholes from the lumber yard ever deliver the damn sheet rock."	3

in a small american town, a band of squirrels had become quite a problem. the presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation. after much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they shouldn't interfere with god's divine will.  at the baptist church the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistery. the deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistery and let the squirrels drown themselves. the squirrels liked the slide and unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.  the lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of god's creatures. so, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the baptist church. two weeks later the squirrels were back when the baptists took down the water-slide.  the episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning. they sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do.  but the catholic church came up with a more very creative strategy! they baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church. now they only see them at christmas and easter.  and not much was heard from the jewish synagogue. they took the first squirrel and circumcised him. they haven't seen a squirrel since	2

a man walks into a bar and orders a jack and coke. the bartender reaches  behind the bar and grabs a dark red apple, and hands it to the customer.  dumbfounded, he says “hey man, what the hell is this? i asked for a jack and coke!”  the bartender said “just go a head and take a bite.”  so the man took a bite and his eyes widened “wow! that tastes just like coke!”  “yup, and now turn it around.”  the customer turned the apple with his fingers and took a bite out of the other side. his eyes closed and squinted and after he swallowed he said “ oof, man that tastes just like jack, and it sure is strong too!” he took his apple with him to a seat further down the bar.  a few minutes later another man walks in and asks for a cranberry vodka and sprite. once again the bartender reached behind the counter and gave his patron an apple, bright white and shiny, and the patron said “hey, what gives? i asked you for a drink, not an apple!”  the bartender said “go a head and take a bite”  so the customer took a bite and and his eyebrows shifted curiously “huh, that tastes a lot like sprite.”  “mmhm. now turn it around”  the patron did so, and took another bite, and when he did, he was blown away, leaning backwards and staring in amazement at the apple. “that tastes just like cranberry vodka! and it sure is boozy!”  a few apples later, a third man walks into the bar. before he can order, however, the previous two patrons exclaimed to him. “dude, this place is amazing, the bartender can give you an apple that tastes like whatever you ask for!” said the first man.  the second chimed in “yeah man, it’s incredible!” he held up his apple “i’m on my fifth cranberry vodka and sprite!”  the new man thinks about his order and says “anything at all huh? mr. bartender, i want an apple that tastes like pussy!”  so the barkeep reached behind the counter and pulled out a big, pink apple that was almost shaped like a heart.  the new customer enthusiastically took a big bite of the apple and after a few chews he violently shook his head in disgust, and spat the piece of apple on the the ground halfway across the bar.   “eeeeugh! that was absolutely disgusting, barkeep, that apple, it... it tasted... it tasted like absolute ass!”  that’s when everyone in the bar shouted “turn it around!”	3

a farmer wakes up to find that his favourite goat has died. since he loved that goat very deeply, he decided to jump into the river by his house and commit suicide. soon after, his wife woke up, and after discovering what had happened, she too followed in his steps and jumped into the river.   their younger son woke up to find both of his parents dead, and seeing no purpose to live, he too jumped into the river. however, a mermaid hoists him up, and makes him an offer, "if you can make love to me 20 times in a row, i'll resurrect your family. however, if you fail to do that, i'll eat you alive."   the young boy agrees, and tries his best. however, he soon gives up and the mermaid eats him. at noon, the older son of the farmer wakes up and finds his family dead. when he walks up to the river and sees his brother's remains, the mermaid again jumps out of the water, and makes him the same offer.   grinning, he asks the mermaid, "what if you up and died on me due to all that sex?"   surprised by his confidence, the mermaid replies,       " you really think you can make love to me 20 times?" "how else do you think the goat died?"	3

african chief whose obsession was to conquer other chiefs and take their thrones as trophies there was this african chief at the turn of the last century whose obsession was to conquer other chiefs and take their thrones as trophies. these thrones he would collect and display in the second level of his magnificent palace just above his own luxurious throne. this palace was renowned for its construction that was in keeping with the best of tradition - everything was made of grass and leaves.  one day, the chief was on his throne receiving some ambassadors when the trophy thrones above him proved to be too heavy and the straw paltform collapsed. the thrones fell on him, and sad to say, he joined his ancestors in the happy hunting grounds.  which just goes to show that people who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.	1

the old golfer"   a circus owner runs an ad for a lion tamer and two people show up. one is a good looking, older retired golfer in his late sixties and the other is a gorgeous blond in her mid-twenties.  the circus owner tells them, "i'm not going to sugar coat it. this is one ferocious lion. he ate my last tamer so you two had better be good or you're history. here's your equipment -- chair, whip and a gun. who wants to try out first?"  the girl says, "i'll go first." she walks past the chair, the whip and the gun and steps right into the lion's cage. the lion starts to snarl and pant and begins to charge her. about halfway there, she throws open her coat revealing her beautiful naked body.  the lion stops dead in his tracks, sheepishly crawls up to her and starts licking her feet and ankles. he continues to lick and kiss her entire body for several minutes and then rests his head at her feet.  the circus owner's jaw is on the floor. he says, "i've never seen a display like that in my life." he then turns to the retired golfer and asks, "can you top that?"   the tough old golfer replies, "no problem, just get that lion out of the way."	1

when mozart passed away, he was buried in a church graveyard. a couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where mozart was buried. terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it.  the priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  when the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "ah, yes, that's mozart’s symphony no. 41, being played backwards."  he listened a while longer, and said, "there's the 25th symphony, and it's backwards too. most puzzling." so the magistrate kept listening; "there's the seventh... the sixth... the fifth..."   suddenly, the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, "my fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. it's just mozart decomposing."	2

my favorite long joke - a man is having an affair with another guy's wife when the husband comes home early. wife : hide in the closest and you'll be fine.  so the man throws on his clothes and jumps in the closet. not long after he hears a little boy's voice in the closet with him.  boy: it's dark in here.  man: yeah so? just please keep it down.  boy: i have baseball. do you want to buy it?  man: sorry but not really.  boy: my dad is downstairs.  man: fine. how much?  boy: $200.  man: what?! that's ridiculous!  boy: my dad is downstairs.  man: ... fine just take the money.  the next day is the same scenario and the man has to hide in the closet again from the husband.  boy: it's dark in here.  man: what do you have today?  boy: my baseball glove.  man: how much?  boy: $300.  man: what?! that's more than the baseball!  boy: my dad is downstairs.  man: ... just take the money.  later on during the weekend. the wife, husband and boy is having breakfast. the husband tells the boy to go grab baseball stuff so they can go play catch in the yard.  boy: i sold my baseball stuff.  husband: what? for how much?  boy: $500 *shows him the money*  husband: son whoever you sold your ball and glove to you totally ripped them off. that is not a honest thing to do and you need to know that. we need to go down to the church and confess that sin.  they drive down to the church and go to the confession box.  husband: now go sit down in there and confess to what you have done.  boy walks in and sits down.  boy: it's dark in here.  priest: don't start that shit in here.	2

the fish and the fly just below the surface of a nearby lake, a fish watches a fly buzzing along and thinks to himself, “if that fly drops 4 inches, i’m gonna jump out of the water and eat that fly.”  a bear at the edge of the woods is also watching and he thinks to himself, “if that fly drops 4” and the fish jumps out of the water to catch the fly, i’m gonna catch that fish and eat it.”  a hunter nearby sees everything and thinks to himself, “if that fly drops 4” and the fish jumps out of the water to catch the fly, the bear will come out of the woods exposing himself and i’m gonna shoot that bear.”  a kitty at the edge of the woods sees what’s happening and thinks to herself, “if that fly drops 4” and the fish jumps out of the water to catch the fly, the bear will lean out of the woods to catch the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear who will then drop the fish - and i will catch and eat that fish!”  time passes and sure enough, the fly dropped 4”, the fish jumped out of the water and ate the fly, the bear leaned out of the woods and caught the fish, the hunter shot the bear, the bear dropped the fish, the kitty lunged out of the woods to catch the fish, but missed and landed in the water.    moral of the story:   when the fly drops 4” - the pussy gets wet.	2

there once was a rich man who was near death. he was very much aggrieved because he had worked very hard for his money, and he wanted to be able to take it with him to heaven.   so he began to pray that he might be able to take some of his wealth.   an angel heard his plea and appeared to him. “sorry, but you can’t take your wealth with you.”   the man implored the angel to speak to god to see if he might bend the rules.   the angel reappeared and announced that god had decided to make an exception and was allowing him to take one suitcase with him.   overjoyed, the man gathered his largest suitcase, filled it with pure gold bars, and placed it beside his bed.   soon afterward the man died and showed up at the pearly gates.   st. peter, seeing the suitcase, said, “hold on, you can’t bring that in here!”   but the man explained to st. peter that he had permission and asked him to verify his story with the lord.   sure enough, st. peter returned, saying, “you’re right. you are allowed one carry- on bag, but i’m supposed to check its contents before letting it through.”   st. peter opened the suitcase to inspect the worldly items that the man found too precious to leave behind and exclaimed, “you brought pavement?”	3

'sister, since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive, would you do something for me?'   'anything, father.'   'i have never seen a woman's breasts, and i was wondering if i might see yours.'   'well, under the circumstances i don't see that it would do any harm.'   the nun opened her habit and the priest enjoyed the sight of her shapely breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty.   'sister, would you mind if i touched them?'... she consented and he fondled them for several minutes.   'father, could i ask something of you?'   'yes, sister?'   'i have never seen a man's penis. could i see yours?'   'i suppose that would be ok,' the priest replied lifting his robe.   'oh father, may i touch it?'   the priest consented and after a few minutes of fondling he was sporting a huge erection.   'sister, you know that if i insert my penis in the right place, it can give life.'   'is that true father?'   'yes, it is, sister.'   'oh father, that's wonderful ... stick it in the camel and let's get the hell out of here!'	3

"i wonder if old gelbstein still has his shop? it's been so long since i was even in that part of the city."  so morris goes down there, and to his amazement, gelbstein's shoe repair is still there, and through the window he actually sees old mr. gelbstein behind the counter. he was sure that the shoes would be long gone, but it wouldn't hurt to ask, so he walked into the shop and greeted the old man, and showed him the 40-year-old ticket. "you wouldn't by any chance still have these shoes, would you?"  gelbstein took the ticket, said "let me check," and toddled off into the back. then he called out, "here they are!"  "man, this guy is amazing," thought morris. gelbstein comes back out and gets behind the counter. he hands back the ticket to morris, and tells him, "they'll be ready on tuesday."	2

"susie, how about you? can you tell us a word that starts with the letter b?"  susie says "ball. b is for ball. a big red one."  the teacher says, "very good, susie. you also had an extra b word in there with the use of the word big. how about the letter c? who has a word for the letter c?"   little johnny of course raises his hand again and the teacher expects him to say a really naughty word, so she picked someone else again.   "tommy, can you please give the class an example of a word that starts with the letter c?"   tommy says, "cat. c is for a crazy cat, who uses his claws to catch mice."  the teacher says "excellent, tommy! you also gave bonus words with the letter c. for that, you get a gold star today!"  she goes through the alphabet, asking the class to name words for wach letter, and on each one, little johnny raised his hand every time but the teacher skipped him because she knows that johnny knows every cuss word in the book.  she finally gets to the letter r and asks the class to give an example, but little johnny is the only one who raised his hand.  she thinks, *i honestly cant think of a dirty word that starts with the letter r, so alright...*  "johnny.....do you have a nice clean word for the class that starts with the letter r?"  johnny says "yes. rats!" "big fucking rats with enormous balls and cocks that are three feet long!!"	2

a christmas story one particular christmas season a long time ago santa was ready for his christmas run... but there were problems. four of his elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the regular ones so santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind schedule. then mrs. claus told santa that her mother was coming to visit.  this stressed santa even more. when he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where.  more stress. then when he began to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground and scattered the toys. so, frustrated, santa went into the house for a cup of coffee and a shot of whisky.  when he went to the cupboard, he discovered that the elves had hid the bottle and there was nothing to drink. in his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor. he went to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. just then the doorbell rang and santa cussed on his way to the door. he opened the door and there was a little angel with a great big christmas tree.  the angel said, very cheerfully, "merry christmas santa. isn't it just a lovely day? i have a beautiful tree for you. isn't it just a lovely tree? where would you like me to stick it?" thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the christmas tree.	1

two army boys, leroy & jasper.... two army boys, leroy & jasper, from the hills of kentucky were promoted right from privates to sergeants because of their great marksmanship with rifles.   not long after, they're out for a walk and leroy says, "hey, jasper, there's the nco club. let's you and me stop in." "but we's privates," protests jasper. "we's sergeants now," says leroy, pulling him inside. "now, jasper, i'm a gonna sit down and have me a drink." "but we's privates," says jasper. "are you blind, boy?" asks leroy, pointing at his stripes. we's sergeants now, so hush your mouth!"   so they have their drinks and pretty soon a hooker comes up to leroy. "you're cute," she says, "and i'd like to date you, but i've got a bad case of gonorrhea." "leroy pulls his friend to the side and whispers, "jasper, go look in the dictionary and see what gonorrhea means. if it's okay, give me the okay sign."   so jasper goes to look it up, comes back and gives leroy the big okay sign. three weeks later leroy is laid up in the infirmary with a terrible case of gonorrhea.   "jasper," he says, "why did you give me the okay sign?"   "well leroy, in the dictionary, it says gonorrhea affects only the privates." he points to his stripes. "but we's sergeants now!"	3

drinking and driving i would like to share a personal experience with my friends about drinking and driving. this might save you the cost and  embarrassment of being arrested for dui. as you know, people have been known to have unexpected brushes with the authorities from time to time, often on the way  home after a "social session" with family or friends. well, this year, it  happened to me. i was out for the evening to a party and had more than several margaritas coupled with a bottle of rather nice red wine. it was  held at a great mexican restaurant. although relaxed, i still had the common  sense to know i was slightly over the limit. that's when i did something i've never done before...i took a taxi home. on the way home there was a  police roadblock, but since it was a taxi they waved it past and i arrived  home safely without incident. these roadblocks can be anywhere and i realized how lucky i was to have chosen to take a taxi. the real  surprise to me was i had never driven a taxi before. i don't know where  i got it, and now that it's in my garage i don't know what to do with it. if you want to borrow it, give me a call.	1

a multi-millionaire living in darwin, australia, decided to throw a party and invited all of his buddies and neighbors... he also invited brian, the only aborigine in the neighborhood.  he held the party around the pool in the backyard of his mansion. everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating prawns and oysters from the barbecue, and flirting.  then at the height of the party, the millionaire said, "i have a 15 foot man-eating crocodile in my pool and i'll give a million dollars to anyone who'll join him in the pool."  the words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.  everyone turned around and saw brian in the pool fighting madly with the crocodile, jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butting it, getting it in choke holds, biting it's tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of martial arts expert.  the water was churning and splashing everywhere. both brian and the crocodile were screaming and raising hell.  finally, after what seemed like an age, brian strangled the crocodile and let it float to the top of the pool like a dead goldfish.  an exhausted brian wearily climbed out of the pool with everybody staring at him in disbelief.  the millionaire said, "well, brian, i reckon i owe you a million dollars then."  "nah, you all right boss, i don't want it," said brian.  so the millionaire said "man, i have to give you something. you won the bet. how about half a million bucks?"  "no thanks, i don't want it," brian insisted.  the millionaire said, "come on, i insist on giving you something. that was amazing. how about a new porsche, a rolex and some stock options?"  once again, brian said, "no."  confused, the rich man asked, "well brian, then what do you want?"  "i want the bastard who pushed me in," said brian.	3

"that man was not a bit happy with our call. he was probably very busy with something, and we annoyed him. now watch, the father dialed the same number again. "hello, is melvin there?" asked the father.  now look here!" came the heated reply. "you just called this number, and i told you that there is no melvin here! you've got a lot of nerve calling again!" the receiver was slammed down hard.  the father turned to his daughter and said, "you see, that was anger. now i'll show you what exasperation means." he dialed the same number, and a violent voice roared, "hello!" the father calmly said, "hello, this is melvin. have there been any calls for me?"	3

"i'll need you to be a bit more specific buddy."  "why squirrel run?" he asked, staring up at me like i held the answers to all of life's great mysteries.  so i explained that the squirrel had much to do, places to go and squirrels to see.  "squirrel fast!" my dog affirmed, and that was that.  the next day, my dog came up to me and asked, "why squirrel hide?"  and i explained that squirrels were much smaller than many other animals and it hid from bigger, stronger predators.  "squirrel sneaky!" my dog said, content with his conclusion.  this morning my dog came over and asked "why squirrel climb?"  and i explained that squirrel lived in trees, where they hid nuts they found and spent the winter.  at thus point, my dog got a very alarmed look on his face, and with a hint of fear asked "squirrel is vet?!"	3
a child wasn't toilet trained yet. whenever he used to go out with his mother, he would always say, "mom, i wanna pee!", "mom, i wanna pee!" his mother would quickly take him to a public toilet or to the bushes or something, so that he stops saying that.  now obviously the mother used to feel embarrassed, since everyone around him used to give weird looks when he said that. the child was grown up to speak properly, but didn't know how to pee yet. so she decided that from now on, they will use a different term for peeing.  "son," she said to him. "it's not a good thing to say *i wanna pee* when there are people around. they will feel bad if they hear you speak like that. do one thing, now if you want to pee, say *i wanna sing*, alright?"  "alright," the child replied.  from that day onwards, whenever the child would go out with his mother, he would always say, "mom, i wanna sing." and his mother used to understand what he's saying and take him to the toilet without any embarrassment.  one night, the child was sleeping between his parents. he wanted to pee. he shook his mother, but she was in deep sleep so she didn't respond. so he woke his father up instead.  "huh, what happened?" his father tried gaining senses.  "dad, i wanna sing," the child replied.  "what! at this time in the night? go to sleep!" his father said, as he didn't know about this different term.  "no, i wanna sing right now," the child said desperately.  "no son, you cannot sing at this time in the night," his father was losing his patience as he really wanted to sleep.  "but i want to sing right now!" the child was losing his patience too.  his father sighed. "alright, do one thing. your mom is in deep sleep anyway. so just quietly sing in her ear."	1

a group of kindergarteners were trying to become accustomed to the first grade. the biggest hurdle they faced was that the teacher insisted on no baby talk.  “you need to use ‘big people’ words,” she’d always remind them. she asked chris what he had done over the weekend.  “i went to visit my nana.”  “no, you went to visit your grandmother. use big people words!” she then asked mitchell what he had done.  “i took a ride on a choo-choo.”   she said: “no, you took a ride on a train. use big people words”. she then asked bobby what he had done.  “i read a book,” he replied.  “that’s wonderful!” the teacher said. “what book did you read?”  bobby thought about it, then puffed out his little chest with great pride and said: “winnie the shit”.	3

"i don't care," said grandpa, "i'd still like to try one, and before we leave in the morning, i'll put the money under the pillow."   later the next morning, the son found $110 under the pillow. he called grandpa and said, "i told you each pill was $10, not $110.

a rabbi, a priest, and an imam were walking down a deserted road when they stumbled upon a pot filled with gold coins after a few moments they all agreed that being men of god, they can't take all the gold for themselves.  they have to give something back to god.  the priest said: i'm going to draw a square on the ground and throw the pot high in the air.  whatever fells inside the square is mine to take, whatever fells outside is god's.  next the imam said: i'm going to draw a circle on the ground and throw the pot high in the air. whatever fells inside is god's and whatever fell outside is mine to keep. after a few seconds the rabbi said: i'm going to draw an equilateral triangle on the ground, then i will throw the pot in the air.  whatever god keeps is his, whatever fell back is mine to keep.	2

revenge on a four-year-old child a while ago, i invited my friend to my house for dinner. he brought along his four year old child, who made a mess of my house, and destroyed two of my expensive plates. i was so angry, but after all, i couldn't vent my anger on a young child. i had no choice but to smile and keep my composure.  i led the child over to my piano, where i allowed him to randomly hit a few keys. i remarked "wow, your son has a good musical sense, he's quite talented!"  i heard the child hasn't had any free time ever since.	3

a florida senior citizen drove his brand new corvette convertible out of the dealership... taking off down the road, he pushed it to 80 mph, enjoying the wind blowing through what little hair he had left.  'amazing,' he thought as he flew down i-75, pushing the pedal even more. but looking in his rear view mirror, he saw a state trooper behind him; blue and red lights flashing and siren blaring.     he floored it to 100 mph, then 110, then 120. suddenly he thought, 'what am i doing?  i'm too old for this', and pulled over to await the trooper's arrival.     pulling in behind him, the trooper walked up to the corvette, looked at his watch and said,  "sir, my shift ends in 30 minutes, plus today is  friday.  if you can give me a reason for speeding that i've never heard before, i'll let you go."    the old gentleman paused then said, "three years ago, my wife ran off with a florida state trooper.  i thought you were bringing her back." "have a good day, sir;" replied the trooper.	2

[long] anger management ok, this is really long but when you finished reading, you'll have a great lige protip.   when you occasionally have a really bad day, and you just need to take it out on someone, don't take it out on someone you know, take it out on someone you don't know.i was sitting at my desk when i remembered a phone call i'd forgotten to make. i found the number and dialed it.  a man answered, saying "hello."i politely said, "this is chris. could i please speak with robyn carter?"suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear "get the right f***ing number!" and the phone was slammed down on me. i couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude .  when i tracked down robyn's correct number to call her, i found that i had accidentally transposed the last two digits.after hanging up with her, i decided to call the 'wrong' number again.when the same guy answered the phone, i yelled "you're an asshole!" and hung up.  i wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. every couple of weeks, when i was paying bills or had a really bad day, i'd call him up and yell, "you're an asshole!" it always cheered me up.  when caller id was introduced, i thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. so, i called his number and said, "hi,this is john smith from the telephone company. i'm calling to see if you're familiar with our caller id program?"he yelled "no!" and slammed down the phone. i quickly called him back and said, "that's because you're an asshole!" and hung up.  one day i was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. some guy in a black bmw cut me off and pulled into the spot i had patiently waited for. i hit the horn and yelled that i'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. i noticed a "for sale" sign in his back window, so i wrote down his number. a couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (i had is number on speed dial,) i thought that i'd better call the bmw asshole, too.  i said, "is this the man with the black bmw for sale?"he said, "yes, it is." i asked, "can you tell me where i can see it?" he said, "yes, i live at 34 oaktree blvd, in fairfax. it's a yellow ranch, and the car's parked right out in front."  i asked, "what's your name?" he said, "my name is don hansen," i asked, "when's a good time to catch you, don?" he said, "i'm home every evening after five."  i said, "listen, don, can i tell you something?"  he said, "yes?"  i said, "don, you're an asshole!"  then i hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.  now, when i had a problem, i had two assholes to call.  then i came up with an idea. i called asshole #1. he said, "hello." i said, "you're an asshole!" (but i didn't hang up.) he asked, "are you still there?" i said, "yeah," he screamed, "stop calling me," i said, "make me," he asked, "who are you?" i said, "my name is don hansen." he said, "yeah? where do you live?" i said, "asshole, i live at 34 oaktree blvd, in fairfax, a yellow ranch, i have a black beamer parked in front." he said, "i'm coming over right now, don. and you had better start saying your prayers." i said, "yeah, like i'm really scared, asshole," and hung up.  then i called asshole #2. he said, "hello?" i said, "hello, asshole," he yelled, "if i ever find out who you are..." i said, "you'll what?" he exclaimed, "i'll kick your ass," i answered, "well, asshole, here's your chance. i'm coming over right now."  then i hung up and immediately called the police, saying that i lived at 34 oaktree blvd, in fairfax, and that i was on my way over there to kill my gay lover.  then i called channel 9 news about the gang war going down in oaktree blvd. in fairfax.  i quickly got into my car and headed over to fairfax. i got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew.  now i feel much better. anger management really does work.	3

a young doctor an an old doctor were standing in a hospital, trying to out-diagnose each other. the competition was heating up, and the next correct diagnosis would be the winner.   just then an old man hobbles by, walking carefully with short, shuffling steps. he has an iv tower with him and appears to be leaning on it for support.  the young doctor snaps his fingers and says “i got this one: recent surgery to fix a ruptured disc.”  the old doctor smiles and shakes his head. “my young friend,” he says, “it looks like drinks are on you tonight. that’s as clear a case of pulled groin as i’ve ever seen.”   the young doctor laughs. “shall we find out then?”  they approach the man and explain their wager. the man stops and nods sagely, while maintaining his too-still demeanor.  “so,” the man says, “you think i had a ruptured disc?” the young doctor nods. “you are mistaken.”  the old doctor grins triumphantly, but the man goes on.  “and you think the i’ve pulled a muscle in my groin?”  the old doctor confirms.   “you are mistaken.”  the doctors are astounded, and now the old man grins.  “bit don’t feel bad,” he says, “you’re not the only one that lost a wager tonight. you see, i thought i had to fart, and i, too, was mistaken.”	1

an infinite amount of mathematicians walk into a bar   an infinite number of mathematicians walk into a bar     the first mathematician orders a beer    the second orders half a beer    "i don't serve half-beers" the bartender replies    "excuse me?" asks mathematician #2    "what kind of bar serves half-beers?" the bartender remarks. "that's ridiculous."  "oh c'mon" says mathematician #1 "do you know how hard it is to collect an infinite number of us? just play along"  "there are very strict laws on how i can serve drinks. i couldn't serve you half a beer even if i wanted to."  "but that's not a problem" mathematician #3 chimes in "at the end of the joke you serve us a whole number of beers. you see, when you take the sum of a continuously halving function-"  "i know how limits work" interjects the bartender  "oh, alright then. i didn't want to assume a bartender would be familiar with such advanced mathematics"  "are you kidding me?" the bartender replies, "you learn limits in like, 9th grade! what kind of mathematician thinks limits are advanced mathematics?"    "he's on to us" mathematician #1 screeches    simultaneously, every mathematician opens their mouth and out pours a cloud of multicolored mosquitoes. each mathematician is bellowing insects of a different shade.  the mosquitoes form into a singular, polychromatic swarm. "fools" it booms in unison, "i will infect every being on this pathetic planet with malaria"  the bartender stands fearless against the technicolor hoard. "but wait" he inturrupts, thinking fast, "if you do that, politicians will use the catastrophe as an excuse to implement free healthcare. think of how much that will hurt the taxpayers!"    the mosquitoes fall silent for a brief moment. "my god, you're right. we didn't think about the economy! very well, we will not attack this dimension. for the taxpayers!" and with that, they vanish.    a nearby barfly stumbles over to the bartender. "how did you know that that would work?"    "it's simple really" the bartender says. "i saw that the vectors formed a gradient, and therefore must be conservative."	2
on a trans-atlantic flight, a plane passes through a severe storm. the turbulence is awful, and things go from bad to worse when one wing is struck by lightning. one woman in particular loses it! screaming. she stands up in the front of the plane. "i'm too young to die, i want my last minutes on earth to be memorable! i've had plenty of sex in my life, but no one has ever made me really feel like a woman! well, i've had it! is there anyone on this plane who can make me feel like a woman?" for a moment there is silence. everyone has forgotten their own peril, and they all stare, riveted, at the desperate woman in the front of the plane. then, a man stands up in the rear of the plane. "i can make you feel like a woman," he says. he's drop-dead gorgeous. tall, built, with flowing black hair and jet black eyes, he starts to walk slowly up the aisle, unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time. no one moves. the woman is breathing heavily in anticipation as the strange man approaches. he removes his shirt. muscles ripple across his chest as he reaches her, and extends the arm holding his shirt to the trembling woman, and whispers: "here, iron this."	2

an american spy is in soviet russia, digging up information on a powerful russian politician. he finds him in a bar, walks in dressed in russian attire, pretending to be russian. everybody in the bar looks at him, but he keeps his cool. he orders a drink and walks to the politician...   "greetings, comrade." says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the russian says, "i think you are american spy."  the spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, "that is not true! i am the proudest soviet there is! i can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!"  he then proceeds to sing the soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.  "very good, very good!" says the politician. "but i still think you are spy."  the man continues to keep his cool.  "i am a historian! i can tell you everything about this glorious country!"  he then spends about two hours recounting the revolution, the great patriotic war, about how superior to the russia is in terms of technology compared to america and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.  "amazing! you are skilled!" says the politician.  the spy smirks.  "but i still think you american spy."  the spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.  he replies, "i am good drinker, a true russian! let us drink, and see who can come out top!"  the bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.  the bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.  after about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.  in the midst of the cheering, the russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, "you are good, you are good... but i still think you are spy."  the american spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.  "okay, you got me. i am an american. but what made you think that way, after all this time?"  the russian politician replies, "there aren't many black people in russia."	3
taxis are foolproof! a couple of nights ago, i was out for drinks with a few friends. had a couple beers and topped it off with shots of tequila. not a good idea.   knowing fully well that i was over the acceptable limit, i did something i never did before: i took a taxi home.  surely enough, i passed a police block, but since it was a taxi they let me through without any problems.  i arrived home safely without incident, which was a real surprise to me the next morning.  i had never driven a taxi before.	2

three men were flying in a small plane when the engine failed to their disappointment, there were only two parachutes on board. after a couple of minutes of silence, one of the men said:  "look, guys, i need to take one of the parachutes. i'm a single father with three children to feed."  the other two agreed and gave him one of the backpacks. the father put it on and jumped off the falling plane.  "so, it's me or you now, eh?", said one of the two men still on the plane  "oh, just take a parachute and jump off," said the other one  "but then you'll die"  "nah, dude, i'll just take the second parachute"  "what do you mean? you just gave it to that guy that jumped off"  "i gave him the backpack where we kept the food. after all, he said he's got kids to feed."  edit: for all the critics down in the comments - i haven't heard any versions of this joke other than this one, so there's no way i'd know that it's better with donald trump or with a boy scout. it's just an english translation of a random joke i saw in my grandfather's newspaper (yes, english is not my first language).  also, here's the mandatory thank you for all the awards.	3

the longest circumcision in history  i had this mate and he used to go on about it his job all the time, you know the type? work, work, work! well this was particularly annoying in his case, as he was a professional circumciser.   i said to him one day do you enjoy your work? and off he went...   he said yes it’s a fantastic job, the money isn’t as good as being a dentist but you get to keep the tips.   also you get to use all the latest cutting edge technology.   some people think that actually i am really expensive but the last thing i want to do is be a rip off.   i do offer discounts but then again most of my customers are jewish and  it’s true they just can’t resist anything that’s 10% off.   i indulged him a little bit and said that’s fascinating do you ever circumcise famous people?   yes he said the other day i circumcised stephen spielberg. he came in and asked for the directors cut. that’s actually ended up getting fired from my practise?   you got fired i said? what happened?   well i got the sack he replied. it’s fine though i’ve joined a new practice where we only circumcise elephants and rhinos. is there much money in that i asked? no he said but the tips are massive. anyway i intend to make some extra income by releasing my book this year.   oh really what’s it called i asked?   cutting it close to the edge  by dr ivan karchakokov. he said.	2

a young nun who worked for a local home health care agency was out making her rounds when she ran out of gas. as luck would have it, there was a gas station just one block away. she walked to the station to borrow a can with enough gas to start the car and drive to the station for a fill up.       the attendant regretfully told her that the only gas can he loaned had just been loaned out, but if she would care to wait he was sure it would be back shortly.       since the nun was on her way to see a patient, she decided not to wait and walked back to her car.       after looking through her car for something to carry to the station to fill with gas,  she spotted a bedpan she was taking to the patient. always resourceful, she carried it to the station, filled it with gasoline, and carried it back to her car.       as she was pouring the gas into the tank of her car, two men watched her from across the street. one of them turned to the other and said, "i know that the lord turned water into wine, but if that car starts, i'm going to church every sunday for the rest of my life."	3

"and if i pay you $100, what cut do the girls get?" "the girls get $80 and the house gets $20." "that's more like it!" the man said. he looked around the room and pointed to an at- tractive redhead. "i'd like her for the night." "i'm sure you would, sir." the madam said, gesturing to a fat 60-year-old woman in the corner, "but ethel there has seniority."	2

yoda and luke are walking through the swamp. part of their usual training course involves shimmying along a cliff ledge, but today, there’s a long break in the ledge they can’t cross. “something for this i have.” yoda says. he reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape.   he tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.  when they get back to yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around yoda’s garden.  “something i have for this.” yoda says again. once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.  yoda and luke return to yoda’s home, where yoda looks through his bag. he’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.  “that’s ok master." luke says, wanting to be helpful. “i’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”  so he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.  he looks down at yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.  “master yoda!” he asks. “what did i do wrong?”  yoda replies sagely, “a jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. never for a tack!”	3

"oh, pierre, i want you to kiss me", she exclaims.   and so he tilts her chin up and leans in, but just before he plants a kiss on her lips, he pours a little red wine on them, and then goes in for the kiss.  "oh, pierre, mon dieu, that was so arousing and erotic, but tell me, why before you kissed me, did you pour red wine on my lip?"  "i am pierre, zee french fighter pilot, and when i taste the red meat, i have the red wine."  "oh pierre, that is so romantic, kiss me again, but lower this time!" and so he carefully unbuttons her blouse and lowers his head. but before he begins, he pours a little bit of white wine on her breast, and then, ravagement.  "oh, pierre, pierre", she squealed, "again, so erotic, so arousing, so magnifique! but tell me, why this time, at my breast, the white wine?"  "i am pierre, zee french fighter pilot, and when i have the white meat, i pair it with the white wine."  "oh pierre, pierre, so romantic, so sensual, kiss me lower, kiss me lower!"   and so he gets down on his knne and lifts her bustle, pushing aside her bloomers and lowers his head. just before he engages, however, he pours a little bit of cognac onto her pubic hair and sets it alight.  "pierre, pierre, why have you done this?" she cried, batting out the flames.  "i am pierre, zee french fighter pilot, and when i go down, i go down in flames."  edit: i'm an old duffer that does not know how to format properly.  edit: holy guacamole guys! thank you so much, if for nothing else, a thoroughly entertaining comments section. it’s not about fish though.  edit: spelling.	3
a wealthy texan oil tycoon made his way to ireland one day as he walked into an irish pub there he made a declaration to all them that were in the room. he pulled out a wad of five-thousand dollars in cash and placed it on the bar. he said, " i hear you irish can drink, so i put to you the challenge that not one of y'all can drink five hundred shots back to back. if you pull it off i'll give you this here five thousand dollars."  the room grew quiet and no one made a sound. at first it appeared that perhaps one man would accept the challenge but he rose to his feet and swiftly walked out. the texan smiled to himself thinking he had won his bet though about a half hour later the same irish man who had gone out earlier walked back into the pub and back up to the bar. he placed his money on the bar next to the texan's stack of bills and said. "alright, i'll take your bet!" the bartender lined up five hundred shots of whiskey and sure enough the irish man swallowed them down in record time. the texan tipped back his hat and handed the challenger his winnings, as he did so he asked him. "say, outta curiosity, where'd you go for that half hour?" the irish man laughed then replied, "oh that! i went to the bar across the street to see if i could really do it first!"	3

a roman, an american, and a jewish man all died. they were immediately sent to hell because they had committed some pretty unsettling offenses in their lives. the roman was a lustful sex offender, the american was extremely gluttonous, and the jewish man was very greedy and stole lots of money over his lifetime.  well, god was feeling pretty generous and decided to give the three men a second chance on earth. he gathered the men into his throne room and told them, “i will give you 24 more hours on earth. if you go these 24 hours without committing your deadly sins, you will be granted an extra 10 years of life on earth and a direct ticket to heaven. but, if you commit your deadly sins, you will immediately be sent back to the deepest circle of the hell.” the three men unanimously agreed and were sent back to earth to begin their trial.  the first thing the american did was buy out an entire hot dog stand and ate all of the food as fast as he could. then, poof! the american was gone.  the first thing the jewish man saw was a 10 dollar bill sitting neatly on the sidewalk. he bent over to pick it up, and poof! the roman was gone.	2

an elderly couple was having dinner at the diner where they had their first date. the husband said, "it's so nice to be back here after all these years."  "yes," agreed the wife, "do you remember our first date here 50 years ago?"  "how could i forget?" answered the husband, "you took me behind that building there across the street and let me put you up against the fence where you gave me the best sex of my life!"  a policeman, who had been overhearing the conversation, nearly spit out his coffee.  "what do you say we do it again?" suggested the wife.  "oh, you naughty devil!" replied the elderly man. he quickly asked the waitress for the cheque and took his wife by the hand, leading her across the street.   the police officer decided to follow them. he thought it was so sweet that a couple of their age could still be so attracted to one another and spontaneous.  he didn't want to ruin their moment but also wanted to make sure nothing bad happened to them, so he decided to keep half an eye on them from a distance.  but the officer could not have prepared himself for what he was about to see. the elderly man dropped his khakis as his wife lifted her dress and propped herself up against the chain link fence. the twisting, the turning, the acrobatics! they elderly couple were as spry and agile as any young couple in their 20's.  when the pair of old lovers were finally finished, lying on the ground catching their breath, the officer couldn't resist. he walked over and said,   "beg your pardon. i couldn't help overhearing your conversation in the diner and wanted to make sure you were ok ... but please tell me your secret! i've never seen anyone make love with that much passion and enthusiasm, let alone a couple who has been married for as long as you have. please, after 50 years of marriage, what is your secret?"  "there's no secret," answered the husband, "but 50 years ago that fence wasn't electric."	1

in celebration of my cake day, here's the worst joke i've ever created. there are two identical twin brothers that live together.  one happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job.  instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home.  one saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot.  he tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food.  after some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store.  in the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off.  he turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.        about 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store.  his vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving.  an ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital.  he ends up in the emergency room under observation, but his condition is critical.  they try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.        the dentist wakes to a knock on the door.  suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues.  eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door.  when he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper.  he is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.        the grim reaper swears.  "oh no!  this always happens with identical twins".        "what do you mean?"  asks the dentist.      "well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and i've come to take him to the underworld.  i'm afraid his time on earth has ended.  i'll take my leave now."        the dentist is noticeably upset.  he says "wait!  isn't there some way i can challenge you for my brother's life?  after all, you made the mistake.  certainly there must be a way i can bargain for his life."        the grim reaper asks "what do you have in mind?"        the dentist thinks.  "how about a challenge?  if i beat you, you let my brother go free."        the grim reaper laughs.  "i will beat you in any challenge.  what challenge do you propose?"        the dentist smiles.  "i propose we see who has the cleanest teeth.  5 minute of brushing each, then we decide."        "very well" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.        once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull.  it's glistening.  he takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes.  after 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright.  the grim reaper grins.  "you are foolish human.  but, you are entitled to your chance."      the dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman.  when his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste.  he smiles.        it's unbelievable.        the shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.        the winner is obvious.  the grim reaper hangs his head in shame.  "you win, human.  this time.  your brother will live."  he disappears in a puff of smoke.  at the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital.  not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy.  suddenly, the phone by his bed rings.  it's his brother, the dentist.  he picks up.  "hey bro.  you'll never believe what happened.  apparently, i went out to the market and got hit by a car.  they say i almost died."        the dentist smiles on the phone and says.  "that's interesting, bro.  today you might say that i also had a brush with death."	3

a man wants to kill his wife so he makes some discreet enquiries, and learns of a hitman who goes only by the name of arthur. he contacts him, and they agree on a price of £1, which is paid up front. the man tells arthur that his wife shops at tesco on saturday mornings.  that saturday, arthur goes to the tesco, sees his mark, comes up behind her, and in one smooth motion slips a garrote over her neck and kills her. however, a store employee saw this and came running over, bad move, he too ends up garrotted. arthur realizes he has to move quickly, and heads to the exit. the store manager has seen what happened, and is coming down toward arthur. he's hoping his few years in the army a decade ago serve him well, but he is no match for arthur, who as they grapple, manages to get his hands around the managers neck and squeeze the life out of him. arthur heads for the exit, but there are 2 security guards. he tries to barrel past, but they are having none of it. they scuffle, arthur gains the upper hand, and one of the guards is dead, the garrote limp around his neck, but then the second guard manages to smash arthur's head against the wall, and he goes down, unconscious. the police are called, and justice begins to run its course. the headline in the next day's local paper reads: artie chokes 4 for £1 in tesco's.	1

in ancient times, an mighty warrior of the germanic tribes cut a swathe through the roman legions. his name was dolf, but he was more commonly called by another name, whispered by mothers to their children as a warning - "the red", owing to the spatters of roman blood that covered his wolfskin armour after battles.  it was a week before christmas night that dolf strode into a small inn, owned by an old ex-centurion and his family. he demanded an ale, and when the barkeeper querulously asked for payment of three copper pieces, dolf glowered at him and said: "do you see my wolfskin armour, old man? do you see the blood spatters on the fur? do you not know who i am," and glancing at the old roman armour and sword handing above the fireplace, spat out, "you filthy old centurion?"  the barkeeper's wife, who'd been listening with one ear, looked over at dolf and said, "you, braggart, are rude, filthy and german. and your 'blood spatters' are just dark patches where the rain has soaked in."  "it's not rain, it's blood, you roman witch!" screamed dolf, pulling out his sword. he then proceeded to slaughter everyone in the inn, the surrounding villages, and nearby farms. he climbed trees to stab the birds, set cruel traps to maul the animals, and spent three days sifting through the dirt around the inn to find all the insects burrowed there, and squash them with his mighty knuckle.  finally, when his spate of death was complete, it was christmas night. he walked over to the now flayed innkeepers wife, who was trussed above the fire. sticking his bloody face into hers, he said, "rude dolf the red *knows* rain, dear."	1

a businessman met with the hitman on the rooftop as planned "look at those bastards cheating on me, in my own bedroom!" the businessman picked up a monocular and looked into the house across the street. "like i said on the phone,i want them to die slowly.shoot the fucker on the dick or something."  "no problem." the hitman set up the sniper rifle and lowered into position, looking very professional.  "torture will cost extra though, i can do it for six thousand dollars per bullet."  the businessman frowned. "on the other hand, my wife probably deserves better. how about you shoot her in the head, make it painless,  and we settle for ten thousand total?"  the hitman remained the same position and didn't say anything.   after an awkward silence the businessman became restless:"well? do we have a deal or what?"  "hang on," the hitman said,"she is working her way down, let me find an angle so we can save you another four thousand."  edit: made it less subtle.	2

zeus is offering a seat in his pantheon to one who can complete his trials of strength. an esteemed hero of all men approaches olympus and thinks hey, why the hell not. if i lose i may be disappointed, but if i win i will join the legendary gods of the pantheon!     so he makes his way to zeus, excited to see what is in store for him in order to prove his worth to the gods. along the way, he sees dozens of noble warriors, bodybuilders and others laying on the ground, devastated. their absolute and utter exhaustion is displayed clearly by the pools of sweat underneath them, and the sound of wheezing could be heard from over 50 yards away. the hero is now concerned, these men appear to be very strong and fit, but he is more so than all of them. a ways further and he sees hercules, chuck norris, and even atlas, who held up the sky for countless years, receiving medical attention for their hands which are shaking uncontrollably. the hero is extremely worried, and heavily considers turning back. if these great men could not best the challenge of strength, then how could i? but the prospect of becoming a god was too tempting, and he pressed forward.     the hero had finally reached zeus who was holding a jar of peanut butter. "welcome, great hero. if you wish to become a god you must complete 4 feats of strength. here is a jar of peanut butter. please open the jar without using any hot water." the hero took the jar, and while tight, presented no challenge as he opened it without a grimace.     "very good" says zeus. "for the next challenge, you must carry 8 bags of groceries in one trip, without dropping any or breaking the eggs." as a man, the hero has done this countless times before, so he was not particularly worried. he picked up 4 in one hand and 4 in the other, and carried them over to zeus's refrigerator.     "you give me hope, challenger! perhaps someone will be able to complete my challenges after all. the feats increase in difficulty, of course, so be prepared for this next one! i have lodged my sword in this slab of granite. retrieve the sword for me and i will present you the final challenge." the hero begins to pull on the sword, and it is very difficult. he notices the sword wiggle slightly, which gives him just enough confidence to unlodge the sword using most of his might. he presents the sword to zeus.     "hero, you have completed the first 3 trials and only one remains. no mortal man has made it this far, and it is as far as hercules, chuck norris, and all the great heroes have made it; but none have succeeded. complete this, and you shall have a seat in the legendary pantheon.     zeus holds out his hand and says “crack this closed pistachio please”	1

a farmer was selling his peaches door to door. he knocked on a door and a shapely 30-something woman dressed in a very sheer negligee answered the door.   he raised his basket to show her the peaches and asked, "would you like to buy some peaches?" she pulled the top of the negligee to one side and asked, "are they as firm as this?"   he nodded his head and said, "yes ma'am," and a little tear ran from his eye. then she pulled the other side of her negligee off asking, "are they nice and pink like this?"   the farmer said, "yes," and another tear came from the other eye. then she unbuttoned the bottom of her negligee and asked, "are they as fuzzy as this?"   he again said, "yes," and broke down crying. she asked, "why on earth are you crying?"   drying his eyes he replied, "the drought got my corn, the flood got my soybeans, a tornado leveled my barn, and now i think i'm gonna get fucked out of my peaches."	1

"well," he said, "i've been seeing this girl for a while and she's really hot. i want the condoms because i think tonight's "the" night. we're having dinner with her parents, and then we're going out, and i've got a feeling i'm gonna get lucky after that. once she's had me, she'll want me all the time, so you'd better give me the 12 pack." the young man makes his purchase and leaves.     later that evening, he sits down to dinner with his girlfriend and her parents. he asks if he might give the blessing, and they agree. he begins the prayer, but continues praying for several minutes. the girl leans over and says, "you never told me that you were such a religious person."    he leans over to her and says, "you never told me that your father is a pharmacist."	3

the librarian and the chicken there was a librarian who worked at the west town library for over 15 years. one day, on an otherwise normal day, a chicken hopped into the library, right up onto the librarians desk, looked her straight in the eyes, and said “bawwwwk bawk bawk bawk !”   she looked at the chicken, confused. the chicken obviously wanted something.   again, the chicken said “bawwwwk, bawwk bawk!”   amazed, the librarian replied, “book?”   the chicken jumped up and down excitedly! so the librarian, thinking she was clever, gave the hen a copy of “chicken little”. the hen promptly picked the book up in her beak and left the library with the book.   the librarian took a moment to question reality, and then brushed it off and went back to work.   the next day, the librarian had completely forgotten about the hen, but after lunch, the hen returned, brought the book with it, and dropped it on the librarians desk.   “bawwwk bawk bawk bawk”  “another one?!” asked the librarian   the chicken jumped up and down. the librarian gave the hen another book, and the hen left.   this continued for two weeks! the liberian couldn’t sleep at night, thinking about what in the world was going on. had someone trained a chicken to check out books because they didn’t want to pay their fines?  was this chicken reading the books?! it obviously could understand some english. the librarian decided that the next day she was going to find out what was going on.   the next day at work, the routine continued.   “bawwwwk bawk bawk bawk!”   “here you go! enjoy!” said the librarian. the chicken left, and the librarian quietly followed. she kept her distance so the chicken wouldn’t know she was following her.   the chicken hopped across town, into the woods, through all kinds of bushes and talk grasses. after several hours, it was starting to get dark, and the librarian was a mess. covered in sticks, wet from the grass, bug bites; she was about to give up when she noticed the chicken had stopped walking and appeared to be looking for something.   the librarian crouched behind a tree and watched.  the chicken walked up to a pond where a very large frog sat on a flat rock. the chicken hopped right up to the frog and dropped the book in front of it.   “bawwwwek bawk bawk!”   the frog looked at the chicken, looked at the book, then opened its large, pink mouth.   “rrrrrreddit....redddddit”  the chicken sighed and picked the book up, and headed back to the library.	1

head larger than the shaft  several years ago, great britain funded a study to determine why the head on a mans' penis is larger than the shaft. the study took two years and cost over $1.2 million. the study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.   after the results were published, france decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. they were convinced that the results of the british study was incorrect. after three years of research at a cost of in excess of $2 million, the french researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex.   when the results of the french study were released, australia decided to conduct their own study. the aussies didnt really trust british or french studies. so, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around $75.00 ( 3 cases of beer), the aussie study was complete. they concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.     \\[not my joke, but to good not to share\\]	2

found this on youtube a few years ago when beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard.  a couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where beethoven was buried.  terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it.  the priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave.  frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  when the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "ah, yes, that's beethoven's ninth symphony, being played backwards."   he listened a while longer, and said, "there's the eighth symphony, and its backwards, too.  most puzzling." so the magistrate kept listening; "there's the seventh... the sixth... the fifth..."   suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, "my fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about.  its just beethoven decomposing."	3

red car day red car day - in honor of my dad  my dad died 7 years ago. he was a worker in a factory in nyc during the by-gone, post-war era when times were good and jobs were plenty. the guys he worked with were all good friends over the years and enjoyed harmless pranks against one another to pass the time. this is one of his best stories which i told at his eulogy.  there was a new guy, jim, who joined the crew the summer of ’74 who became an instant comrade. the jokesters of the crowd - my dad amongst them - decided after a month or 2 it was time for a prank.  it’s important to recall in those days there were no cell phones, computers, google, ezpass computerized toll collection, nothing. if you needed to go anywhere back then you needed physical directions “go a mile down the road and at the gas station make a left.” even toll roads (bridges and such) had people manning them and if you dared speed through, there were dedicated patrol cars who would chase after you, get the toll and give you a ticket, right then and there.  they decided to invite him to the end of summer cookout traditionally given by ben, one of the men at my dad’s job. jim was told that ben lived in a remote area where even a physical map wasn’t going to help nearing his house.   “you’ve got to follow someone on the highway to get there because the exits get really tricky,” they told jim. he asked my dad if he could follow him to the cookout.   dad: “sure,” my dad said. “by the way, what color car do you have?” my dad asked rather matter of factly.   jim: “well, red i guess. why?”   d: “you lucky sob. the cookout is on the 19th, it’s red car day on the highway that day.”  j: “red car day?! what the hell are you talking about?”  d: “what are you living under a rock? the highway has free toll days for red, black, yellow and blue cars on the 2nd, 14th, 19th and 22nd of every month during the summer.”  j: “i never heard of that. why the hell do they do that?”  d: “when they were building this highway back in the 40s there were 4 deaths, and those 4 men are honored with free tolls on the days they died. 3 months out of the year they give people with red, black, yellow and blue cars (the color of the cars the men had) free tolls to honor the brave men who died building the very road you’re driving on.”  j: “wow! that’s quite a story. i had no idea. i have to admit i don’t travel that road very but that is really very nice to honor them that way.”   so, jim made arrangements to follow my dad (with me, my brother and mom in the car with him) on the 22nd of august.   as we got onto the highway, my dad made sure to drive slow enough to not lose jim and be absolutely certain jim was right behind my dad as they approached the toll plaza. my dad rolled down the window to pay the toll saying to the clerk, “i’m paying for me and guy directly behind me.”  as my dad drive away slowly, jim inched up not really sure what was going to happen. however, the toll booth clerk just waved her hand as if to say “go ahead” and jim, a tad startled at first, hit the gas and went.  my dad giggled a bit, then made sure to keep driving slow enough to not lose jim as they approached the second toll plaza. my dad said to the clerk, “this is for me and guy directly behind me.”  as my dad drive away slowly, you could see jim was more confident but still cautious. however, as the toll booth clerk waved his hand “go ahead” jim hit the gas, this time a smile crawling across his face. he gained up to my dad in no time.  the traffic was getting a bit thicker now and my dad used this traffic to partially lose jim, but make sure he could still see him. approaching the next toll plaza, my dad was in a different lane than jim. my dad stopped and paid the toll while jim sailed through the toll lane. you could hear the audible alarm of a toll-jumper, and the black-n-white police car in hot pursuit of jim.   my dad pulled away slowly from the toll catching up to jim hearing him arguing with the cop, “yeah, it’s red car day.”  the funniest part was hearing jim tell his side of it at the bbq. all the fellas chipped in to pay the fine.   :-)	1

several years ago, andy was sentenced to prison. during his stay, he got along well with the guards and all his fellow inmates. the warden saw that deep down, andy was a good person and made arrangements for andy to learn a trade while doing his time.   after three years, andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area.  often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community and he always reported back to prison before sunday night was over.  the warden was thinking of remodeling his kitchen and in fact had done much of the work himself.  but he lacked the skills to build a set of kitchen cupboards and a large counter top, which he had promised his wife.  so he called andy into his office and asked him to complete the job for him.  but, alas, andy refused.  he told the warden, "gosh, i'd really like to help you but counter fitting is what got me into prison in the first place."	3

two aliens come to our planet they are greeted by armed forces. they inform us that our inferior weapons don't stand a chance against them. the only way they will let us go is if we can make them laugh. however, they have seen all jokes there are on the internet and only a new original joke will work on them. humanity gathers the greatest comedians and scientists to come up with an original joke but everyone's opinion on what is a good joke turns out to be at conflict. furious, one scientist proclaims that we have to know which of our earlier jokes the aliens at least found funny. all the comedians and scientists agree on this. so a scientist goes to talk with the aliens and ask them which of our old jokes they laughed at the most. the aliens respond.   aliens: "the one where this reality tv star becomes the ruler of the free world"  the scientist is taken aback and thinks for a second before responding.  scientist: "but that wasn't a joke. that actually happened"  the aliens burst out laughing and leave the planet without saying a word.	2

"just dip your pinky finger in here and you'll be purified, then we'll let you in."  she does, and is let in.  peter calls up the second nun, and says, "alright, sister, same question: have you ever touched a penis?"

"okay," peter says, "just wash your hands in the holy water and we'll let you in."  she does and is let in.  peter is about to call up the third nun, but he notices that the fourth nun behind her is visibly shaken, pale, and really nervous. so he says, "what's the matter, sister?"  she gestures to the third nun and says, "well, if it's all the same to you peter, i'd rather gargle that water before she sticks her ass in it."	3

each friday night after work, bubba would fire up his outdoor grill and cook a venison steak. but all of bubba's neighbors were catholic....and since it was lent, they were forbidden from eating meat on friday.  the delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a problem for the catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest.  the priest came to visit bubba and suggested that he become a catholic. after several classes and much study, bubba attended mass.....and as the priest sprinkled holy water over him, he said, "you were born a baptist, and raised a baptist, but now you are a catholic."  bubba's neighbors were greatly relieved, until friday night arrived, and the wonderful aroma of grilled venison again filled the neighborhood. the priest was called immediately by the neighbors and as he rushed into bubba's yard clutching a rosary preparing to scold him, he stopped and watched in amazement.  there stood bubba, clutching a small bottle of holy water which he carefully sprinkled over the grilling meat and chanted:  “you wuz born a deer, you wuz raised a deer, but now you is a catfish."	1

"now it's his 7th symphony backwards! now his 6th, now his 5th, and-"  the teacher blinks, then gets up and begins brushing off his clothes.  "no need to be alarmed. he's just decomposing."	2

this joke was originally told to me in chinese - let’s see if it flows just as well in english an emperor with finds out that there is a spy inside his grand army. he decides to interrogate every single person in the army.  a young trooper in the army does not speak the emperor’s native language, and is worried that he would be suspected as the spy. his friends in the army, however, decide to help him.  “he does these checks every few years, and he asks the same three questions in the same order,” reassures one of the soldiers. the young trooper is told how to answer the three questions: how old he is, how long he was in the army, and if he enjoys being enlisted.  days pass and it’s now the young trooper’s turn to be interrogated. he calmly walks into the emperor’s room.   this time, however, the emperor decides to ask the questions in a different order.  “how long have you been in the army?” the emperor asks in his language. the young trooper, not understanding the question but knowing the supposed answer, says “thirty-three years old!”  the emperor is puzzled and begins to be suspicious of this young trooper. he asks next, “how old are you?”  “four years!” the young trooper replies confidently.  instead of being suspicious the emperor is now worried. “are you in need of mental help?”  “very much!” the trooper replies with a wide smile on his face.	3

a priest hooks a huge fish a priest hooks a huge fish  helping him reel it in, a sailor says "whoa, look at the size of that fucker!".  "hey, mind your language!" says the priest.  embarrassed, the sailor thinks quickly and blurts out, "sorry father, but that's what this fish is called, it's a fucker fish".  accepting the explanation, the priest forgives the sailor and takes the fish back to church.  "look at this huge fucker" says the priest, spotting the bishop.  "language, please! this is god's house," replies the bishop.  "no, no that's what this fish is called, "says the priest.  "oh," says the bishop, scratching his chin "i could clean that fucker and we could have it for dinner".  so the bishop takes the fish, cleans it, and brings it to the mother superior.  "could you cook this fucker for dinner tonight?" he asks her.  "my, what language!" she exclaims, clearly shocked.  "no, sister that's what the fish is called - a fucker", says the bishop.  satisfied with the explanation, the mother superior says, "wonderful, i'll cook that fucker tonight, the pope is coming for dinner!"  the fish tastes just great and the pope asks where they got it.  "well, i caught the fucker!" says the priest.  "and i cleaned the fucker!" says the bishop.  "and i cooked the fucker!" says the mother superior.  the pope stares at them for a minute with a steely glaze, leans back on his chair, takes off his cap, puts his feet up on the table, pours himself a whiskey and says:" you know what?, you cunts are alright."	3

there's this kid named tommy. he has no body. he is just a head. tommy was born without a body or any limbs, so his entire life he has existed as a head only-- he learned to roll around, use his mouth to maneuver things, and live just like a normal kid.   one day tommy rolled into school just like any other day, banged against his locker to open it, started to get his books when, all of a sudden, he spots a new student.  tommy thinks she's absolutely beautiful. her hair is perfect, her body is amazing (which tommy slightly envied, but had gotten over those thoughts mostly by now), and she had an amazing sense of fashion. there was just one thing off about this girl though; she only had one eye, and in place of her other eye was a prosthetic eye made of wood. it didn't even look like a real eye, it just looked wooden.  tommy saw her and his jaw dropped to the floor-- "what's her name?" he asked a friend.  "oh, her? that's sally, the girl with a wooden eye."  tommy saw past her wooden eye and was starstruck ever since he first laid eyes on sally. he made it his mission to ask sally to prom.  weeks later, tommy finally gathered the courage to ask his crush the big question. he rolled up to her in the cafeteria and said, "hey sally, i'm tommy. i was wondering if you wanted to go to prom with me?"  sally looked down at him for a second, and said, " uhmm.. i'm sorry tommy.. i don't think so."  this devastated tommy. he had felt all sorts of pain and denial in his life from not having a body. he knew what rejection and denial felt like having been left out of all the activities full bodied people could do. but nothing hurt quite as much as this. his heart was shattered. and then tommy turned into a grape.  so now tommy is a grape, just rolling around school, and he is depressed like never before. people see tommy and notice that something is off with him. he's so depressed, that he turned into a grape.  sally sees this and begins to feel really bad. "was i too harsh?" she asked a friend, " maybe i should go try to make it up to him." now sally made it her mission to ask tommy to the prom, and hopefully he would return to normal.  after school, sally went by tommy's house and knocked on the door. tommy answered, and she was surprised for a second that a grape could answer the door-- but nonetheless, she moved forward with her mission.  "tommy, i wanted to ask you something... would you go to prom with me?"  tommy didn't believe his ears for a second-- the most beautiful girl he had ever seen had just asked him to the prom! without thinking, he replied,  "oh wood eye, wood eye!"  sally was offended and crushed him.  the moral of the story: stop while you're a head.	3

"look at this, this is really something," the student tells the examiner as he pulls the cork back out again. they hear: "on the road again...just can't wait to get on the road again..."   "so what?" the medical examiner replies, obviously unimpressed with the student's discovery.   "but isn't that the most amazing thing you've ever seen?" asked the student.   "are you kidding?" replied the examiner, "any asshole can sing country music."	3

a man is walking down the street and sees another guy with a tiny companion who is about a foot tall and playing bach on a little piano. he hesitates for a second before saying “sorry, but i’ve got to ask: what’s your story?”  the bigger guy points to the unmarked storefront behind him and says “there is a genie inside granting wishes.”  mouth agape, hardly believing what he hears, the man curiously walks inside, and sure enough, sees a small golden lamp sitting on a table. he rubs the lamp, and a wispy trail of smoke begins to leak out, coalescing into the basic stereotypical genie, shirtless vest, turban, baggy pants and all. in a booming voice, the genie says, “well met, traveler, what is your heart’s desire? i can grant you one wish!”  “i’d like to be incredibly rich!”  “say again?”  “i’d like to be rich beyond my wildest dreams!”  “i’m sorry you’ll have to speak up!”  raising his voice to a shout, the man says again “i want a million bucks!”  the genie registers a look of recognition and snaps his fingers, and materializing out of thin air, countless ducks appear, quacking and flapping their wings, covering every inch of the floor, falling and flailing all over each other, and streaming further out the door. the genie disappears back into his lamp. simultaneously awestruck and pissed off, he rubs the lamp again to no avail.   walking back outside, he sees the man and his little musician, and the rest of what he’s fairly sure amounts to a million ducks. angrily, he says, “that genie was fucking deaf! i wished for a million bucks and this is what i got!”  “well you didn’t think i really wished for a 12 inch pianist, did you?”	1

far off, in a distant land, there were three kingdoms. each kingdom had faced a side of a triangular lake. the first kingdom was the youngest, and wealthiest kingdom. they have the most business, biggest buildings, and the strongest military.   the second kingdom, is about 50 years older than the first. they aren't the wealthiest, but they are well off. it has a fair amount of business, decent sized buildings, and a good military.   the third, is the oldest kingdom. most people left this kingdom for one of the other two, leaving only the middle aged and elderly. because of this, the business has suffered, leaving to a poor economy. most buildings are covered in vines, businesses have closed, and the military is quite small.   eventually, the kingdoms go to war of the lake, being fresh water is an incredibly valuable resource.   the first kingdom sends 1000 of it's best knights, in plate armor, each with a squire.  the second sends 500 of it's best knights, in chainmail armor, each with a squire.  the last kingdom sends it's last remaining knight, in leather armor, with his squire.   the night before the battle, the soldiers from the first and second kingdoms party it up, being this may be the last night they are alive. lots of food, drinking, etc.   the elderly knight from the last kingdom throws a rope over a tree branch, makes a noose, and puts a pot in it to make a stew. he and his squire ate on this for the night.   the morning of the battle, the soldiers from the first two kingdoms are too hungover and drunk to fight, so they all send their squires to fight. the elderly knight from the third, however, is too old and his bones ache too much to get up, so he sends his squire to fight.   the battle wages for weeks and weeks, and at the end, there's only one survivor! it's the old man's squire from the third kingdom!  this goes to show...  that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires from both sides.	2

a dutch and belgian soldier patroll the river maas. (srry if repost) patrols are conducted on both sides of the river maas. a dutch soldier walks on one side, a belgian soldier on the other. it is early in the morning and there is still some fog on the water.   the dutch soldier wonders which section of the army the belgian soldier is on. he wants to ask the belgian with gestures.   the dutchman makes a fluttering gesture and shouts: "are you in the air force?" the belgian looks, but does not answer. the dutchman makes a swimming gesture and shouts: "are you in the navy?" the belgian looks again, but does not answer.   the dutchman thinks: he is not in the air force and not in the navy. then he is definitely in the army. maybe he's with the shock troops. the dutchman makes the gesture with a finger in a hole and shouts: "are you with the shock troops?" the belgian looks, but is silent. maybe he's with the scouts. the dutchman gestures with binoculars and shouts: "are you with the scouts?"  then the belgian throws his gun on the ground and runs off to the barracks. "what are you doing here?" asks the commander: "you have to patrol the maas."  “and i am crazy,” says the belgian, “an crazy dutchman walks on the other side and says to me: (flying-gesture) if the fog has cleared, (swiming-gesture) then i will swim to the other side, (finger-in-hole-gesture) i will fuck you (binocular gesture) until your eyes look like this. ”	1

"it figures", she thought, and resolved to go inside and file a complaint. on a rocking chair near the door, an old man was sitting and masturbating openly. horrified, she stomped into the bar and straight away went up to the sheriff, who was sitting at the bar.   she shouted at the sheriff: "what sort of town are you running here?! you've got people running around the desert fucking coyotes, and- and just outside there was an old man masturbating openly! how can you explain this?!"  the sheriff sipped his beer and said, "ah well, you can't expect him to catch a coyote at his age"	3

"why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  so the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *my daughter is inviting all of her friends, and i'll look bad if i don't put together a good cake*, he thought. then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.  *how quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  he was met by a buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "hello," the father asked, "i would like to buy a cake."  "of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  the father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  the day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. all of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  the monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "why do you do this for free? you should take money for your services!"  the monk smiled and said, "i do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."  part 2 and part 3 in my profile	3

the great detective herlock sholmes was hired to investigate the disappearance of one of the most important political figures in the nation. he was quickly briefed on the current situation: at two in the morning, a young woman named andrea had been captured by an unknown party. now normally, a kidnapping wouldn’t be something to call in the great herlock sholmes for, but andrea was a special case.  in the nation of modgasia, the government consisted of four ruling councilmembers, called houses: the house of wisdom, the house of courage, the house of justice, and the house of power. together, these houses formed the cell, the central ruling government of the nation. andrea was the daughter of lady lillian isda, the current house of power, considered to be the house with the greatest authority – and lady isda had recently fallen ill.  there were several suspects presented to herlock sholmes as he listened to the case. first, but least likely, was lady isda, who some said feared the loss of power – but she loved her daughter too much to have done something like that. second was the wisdom house, connor fucius, who disliked the isda family, but lacked the resources to pull off a kidnapping like this one.  finally, and most likely, was the justice house, justin iceberg, who was in charge of the secret police force the modgasia advanced intelligence, or mai for short. the mai operated independently under justin’s supervision and did whatever he told them to, no questions asked. on top of that, the young justice house was andrea’s ex-boyfriend, rumored to have broken up on bad terms, and strongly opposed all of her political stances.  detective sholmes sat in his armchair, his ever-present tabby cat watson curled on his lap as he listened to the investigative report. lady isda sat bawling across from him, a mountain of tissues already heaped besides her.  “hmmm…” was all the detective said, after a few minutes of contemplation.  “well? have you figured out anything?” the lady cried out as she grabbed more tissues.  herlock sholmes stroked his pussy. “yes. you see, it’s biology, my dear watson.”  “biology?!” lillian isda cried out.  herlock sholmes nodded and looked up.  “the mai took andrea isda, power house of the cell.”	1

my favorite uncle told this joke about a week before he passed away. he did it with a thick irish brogue. a priest and a nun were talking and the priest said, “sister, if you hadn’t been a nun what do think you would have been?” the nun thought for a minute and said, “if i hadn’t been a nun i probably would have been a prostitute.” the priest was shocked and said, “now sister i don’t think i heard you quite right. i’ll ask you again. if you hadn’t been a nun what would you have done with your life?” the nun turned to him and said, “father if i’ve told you once i’ve told you a thousand times if i hadn’t been a nun i would’ve been a prostitute.” the priest said, “oh thank me stars. for a minute i thought i heard you say you would have been a protestant.”	1

suite 103  the scotch wasn’t going down easily today, but that didn’t make pouring some more any more difficult for adam. the phone call he had received three days earlier kept replaying in his mind over and over again. she was out of town for a press conference. “i can’t not go, honey. i was the lead designer for the prototype. who else is going to announce and describe its features?” adam never became too involved in alexa’s career. he was supportive, but the amount of time she spent away from home was anything but enjoyable for adam. adam was a retired homicide investigator, though his retirement was earlier than he’d have preferred. he’d known it would happen if he kept pursuing the case, but a double homicide on two children under the age of 10 was too much for adam to just “let go.” during his investigation, he got in a bad way with some worse people and became too much of a liability for the department. retirement was the only option. the phone call though… the phone call changed everything. alexa’s assistant was in tears as she told him. adam couldn’t suppress his despair when he found out his beloved wife was found with a gun in her hand and a bullet through her head in the company paid hotel suite: suite 103. adam was waiting. he was told that his arrest was inevitable if he interfered with the investigation. that wouldn’t stop him from conducting his own once the unmotivated machine-men finished lazily going through their procedures. he arrived the next day at the hotel, and his hangover disappeared as soon as he walked through the doors. the hotel manager seemed to be giving him looks of disapproval as soon as he walked through the door, so unsurprisingly, he refused to allow adam into suite 103 since the investigation was over and had already deemed the death a suicide. adam knew alexa better than that. this wasn’t a suicide no matter what the investigation seemed to reveal, and no bitter hotel manager with a big nose and a bigger stick up his ass would keep adam from finding out what really happened in that hotel suite. adam headed into a maintenance hallway and began watching the workers. they seemed to still be talking about the incident in suite 103. adam noticed one girl in particular: a blonde, around 22 years of age who he knew would have a wonderful smile if she allowed one to occupy her face. a smile seemed out of the question for her, though. she seemed to feel more uncomfortable talking about the “suicide” than the other workers, and upon learning she worked with the housekeeping staff, adam knew she was his way in. he waited for her to enter the restroom and seated himself close enough for her to notice him when she walked out, but far enough away to be covert about it. thinking about alexa was all adam needed for tears to begin streaming down his face. the blonde exited the restroom and stared at him for a bit before approaching him. “are you okay?” whispered the girl. “i’ve had better days.” stuttered adam. while explaining his situation, adam learned the girl’s name was alex—a convenient coincidence as far as adam was concerned. alex had tears glistening in her eyes by the time adam was finished, and it was not difficult to convince her to help him. there were three conditions adam had to follow if he wanted to have access to suite 103: 1. he had to make his own copy of the key to the room. 2. alex’s involvement in helping him had to remain a secret no matter what. 3. adam had to only access the suite at evenfall for around half an hour each day, as that was the latest time he could enter without seeming suspicious, and shift changes of security personnel lasted around that long. adam’s first day in the suite didn’t yield much. he noticed the bullet hole in the wall didn’t make much sense with what he expected based on evidence from alexa’s head, but that was all speculation since adam didn’t get to observe the initial investigation. over a period of nine days, adam visited suite 103 each day for a half hour. he noticed nothing that the investigation hadn’t already revealed. he went home on day nine and thought that maybe he didn’t know his wife as well as he thought he did. he tried to convince himself that his efforts weren’t all for naught, but nothing seemed to support that idea. as he was drowning in those depressing thoughts, he realized that there was one thing he hadn’t looked at. investigators avoid searching sheets and any other form of fabric for fingerprints because the material does not hold the prints like a glossy and hard surface does; however, that hotel room had a blanket over the comforter on the bed that was mainly there for aesthetic appeal. this blanket had some sort of glossy coating on it from what adam had observed when he removed it from the bed on day one. if there were one place from which someone wouldn’t think to clean their fingerprints, that place would be on a blanket. adam couldn’t wait for the next night. he grabbed his supplies for revealing prints and his key to the suite and rushed back to the hotel. he hurried through the doors and saw alex whose eyes widened upon seeing him. she vigorously shook her head, but adam ignored it and jogged to the suite, opening the door and entering. he began applying a powdery residue to the glossy blanket. the door swung open and the hotel manager’s silhouette came into view on the mirror in front of the door. “get out!” he screamed. adam knew he wouldn’t be able to reason with the hotel manager, so he just kept searching the blanket for fingerprints. adam worked through the hotel manager calling the police and worked through the hotel manager’s constant screaming. sure enough, the blanket was covered in prints. prints from multiple people. prints from more people than were involved in his wife’s death, but adam knew that some of them belonged to her killer. seconds after this revelation, adam’s arm was grasped firmly and he was handcuffed and brought to his feet. “no! my wife was killed! murdered! the killer’s prints are on that sheet! i know it!” the officers would not listen and they led adam to the doorway. adam walked away from his life and left his heart on that blanket. as the hotel room door closed, adam turned back toward the room as a single tear streamed down his cheek. emotion overwhelmed his voice as he opened his mouth and whispered, “good night, suite prints.”	1

the horse, the cow, and the chicken[long] so a horse, a cow, and a chicken live on a farm. one day their owner goes on vacation but accidentally leaves the tv on. the animals peek in the window and witness a rock concert on the tv, theyre inspired.  so the horse calls up guitar center, and asks “hey i want to learn the guitar, but there’s one problem: i’m a horse.” the employee says “no problem come right down we’ll teach you everything you need to know” and before you know it, he’s jamming out on the guitar. after that the cow calls too and says “hey i want to learn how to play the bass but there’s a problem: i’m a cow” to where the employee replies “awesome! we have special bass lessons just for cows this week come on down!” and before you know it the horse and cow are jamming in harmony with their guitar and bass. lastly the chicken calls and asks for drum lessons, to where he is accepted with open arms. they are now all jamming in the barn and having a blast.  a few days later, a record producer coincidentally walks through town and sees the horse, cow, and the chicken making music. he instantly knows he has to make them famous and offers them a deal. now the horse, cow, and chicken are famous, worldwide rockstars making millions of dollars and even moved off the farm to a luxurious estate. with the fortune came fame and life was great.  one day, on the way to tour before boarding the plane, the horse gets a phone call, his mom is sick! the cow and the chicken say “don’t worry we’ll go without you, catch up and the tour will continue it’ll be fine” so the horse goes to check on his mother. it turns out it was a false alarm, but the plane crashes and the cow and chicken die.  the horse is devestated, the money power and fame is gone, the music is in the past, and he is back to the barn, but alone without his friends. in agony and desperation after such a long journey, he decides to get a drink. he walks into the bar and the bartender asks:  “why the long face?”	3

a duck walks into a pub and orders a pint of beer and a ham sandwich. the barman looks at him and says… “hang on! you're a duck!”  "i see your eyes are working.” replies the duck.  "and you can talk!!” exclaims the barman.  "i see your ears are working, too.” says the duck. "now if you don't mind, can i have my beer and my sandwich please?"  "certainly. sorry about that.” says the barman, as he pulls the duck's pint. "it's just, we don't get many a ducks in this pub. what are you doing around this way?"  "i'm working on the building site across the road” explains the duck. "i'm a plasterer."  the flabbergasted barman cannot believe the duck, and wants to learn more. but takes the hint when the duck pulls out a newspaper from his bag and proceeds to read it. the duck reads his paper, drinks his beer, eats his sandwich, pays up, bids the barman a good day and leaves.  the same thing happens for two weeks.  then one day the circus comes to town. the ringmaster comes into the pub for a pint and the barman says to him "you're with the circus, aren't you? well, i know this duck that could be just brilliant in your circus. he talks, drinks beer, eats sandwiches, reads the newspaper and everything!"  "sounds marvellous!” says the ringmaster, handing over his business card. "get him to give me a call."  so the next day when the duck comes into the pub the barman says "hey mr. duck, i reckon i can line you up with a top job, paying really good money."  “swell. i’m always looking for the next job.” says the duck. "where is it?"  "at the circus.” says the barman.  "the circus?" repeats the duck.  "that's right.” replies the barman.  "the circus??” the duck asks again "...with, the big tent?”  "yeah.” the barman replies.  "with all the animals who live in cages, and performers who live in caravans?" asks the duck.  "of course.” the barman replies.  "and the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?" persists the duck.  "that's right.” says the barman.  the duck shakes his head in amazement, and says… "what the f\\*\\*k would they want with a plasterer?!?!”	3

new woman joins a golf club. when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, "i played on my college's golf team. i was pretty good. mind if i join you next week?" no one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot. finally, one man says. "okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m." he figures the early tee-time will discourage her. the woman says this may be a problem, and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late. they roll their eyes, but say, "okay." she's there at 6:30 a.m. sharp, and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. she's fun and pleasant, and the guys are impressed. they congratulate her and invite her back the next week. she smiles, and says, "i'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45." the next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp. only this time, she plays left-handed. the three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. they're totally amazed. they can't figure her out. she's very pleasant and a gracious winner. they invite her back again, but each man harbours a burning desire to beat her. the third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. this week she plays right-handed, and narrowly beats all three of them. the men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. however, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge. this woman is a riddle no one can figure out. they have a couple of beers in the clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, "how do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?" the lady blushes, and grins. "when my dad taught me to play golf, i learned i was ambidextrous," she replies. "i like to switch back and forth." "when i got married after college, i discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. from then on, i developed a silly habit. right before i leave in the morning for golf practice, i pull the covers off him. if his willie points to the right, i golf right-handed; if it points to the left, i golf left-handed." the guys think this is hysterical. astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, "what if it's pointing straight up?" she says, "then, i'm fifteen minutes late."	3

singles on a deserted island a luxury cruise ship offered a cruise for young singles only. but halfway through the voyage, the ship crashed. the captain had been having a affair and didn't see the giant rock formation. the cruise ship went down in record time (as did the captain). most people on board were too drunk to act fast and escape. in the end, there were only 6 survivors.mike, tom, william, timothy, frank and wendy.  these 6 people managed to get in a lifeboat and get to a tropical island. on this island they found a deserted research facility where everything for basic survival was present. equipment, beds, canned food and water. unfortunately, there was no radio or other means to contact the outside world. tom said: "well, at least there's no button we have to press every 108 minutes.". his joke was lost to the others.  so these 6 people started a new life on their island. but there was still one issue to resolve.sex.with 5 straight guys and only 1 woman, they had to work something out. after much discussion they came to the following arrangement.  each man got one day of the week in which he could have sex with the woman. the day was chosen by the first letter of their name. so mike on mondays, tom on tuesdays, william on wednesdays, timothy on thursdays and frank on fridays. and in the weekends, wendy would get to choose her bed partner if she even wanted one.  this arrangement worked well for several weeks. that all changed when wendy got real sick after an infection. none of them was a doctor and they hadn't found any medication on the island. they couldn't save her and so wendy died.  on top of losing their friend, they also lost the only woman on the island.  the first week passes by and everything went great.   the second week passes by and everything was good.   the third week it was getting harder.   the fourth week it had become unbearable.  that's when they decided to bury wendy.  \\-----------------  yes, this is a repost of a joke i had once posted before but i reworked it a bit. on top of that, this is my cake day. so i get to post what i want (including potential grammatical mistakes).	3

"i'm a sailor, and we are off to italy tomorrow.   i can stow you away on my ship.  i'll take care of you, bring you food every day, and keep you happy."   with nothing to lose, combined with the fact that she had always wanted to go to italy, the woman accepted.  that night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold.  from then on, every night he would bring her three sandwiches, a bottle of red wine, and make love to her until dawn.  three weeks later she was discovered by the captain during a routine inspection.   "what are you doing here?" asked the captain.   "i have an arrangement with one of the sailors," she replied.  "he brings me food and i get a free trip to italy ."   "i see," the captain says.   her conscience got the best of her and she added, "plus, he's screwing me."   "he certainly is," replied the captain.  "this is the staten island ferry ."	3

a man went to his doctor because he had trouble peeing... he complained about how he had to struggle to even get a few drops out. frowning for a brief moment, the doctor assures him that a simple surgery would fix the problem. the next day, the man returns to the hospital for the surgery and the doctor proceeds, the only issue being that the man's testicles would have to be temporarily extracted. the doctor thus removes the testicles and places them on an operating dish but carelessly leaves the door open and his dog comes in, sees the testicles and munches away. horrified, the doctor thinks hard for a moment and then, kills the dog and extracts its testicles and puts them in the man without informing him. he completes the operation, stitches the patient back up and eventually sends him home . the next evening, while at home relaxing. the doctor receives a visitor which happens to be the man operated upon. terrified that the man was coming to confront him, he asks weakly and timidly if everything was fine, to which the man responded with a big grin: "oh never felt better doctor! i pee easily and freely and i owe it all to you!" the doctor let out a huge sigh of relief and was about to offer the man a drink when he was asked: " there's just one question i have for you doc, why is it that whenever i pee, i have to raise a leg?

why their are angels on top of the xmas tree have you ever wondered how the tradition of putting an angel on the tree started? it may not be as magical as you might think,   when four of santa's elves got sick, the trainee elves did not produce toys as fast as the regular ones, and santa began to feel the pre-christmas pressure.  then mrs. claus told santa that her mother was coming to visit, which stressed santa even more. when he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where.  then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered.  frustrated, santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. when he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.  in his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor.  he went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom. just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big christmas tree.  the angel said very cheerfully, "merry christmas, santa. isn't this a lovely day? i have a beautiful tree for you. where would you like me to stick it?"  and thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the christmas tree.  (heard this joke awhile ago but it's still funny)	2

old jewish man  an old jewish man is walking down the street one afternoon when he sees a woman with perfect breasts.       he says to her, "hey miss, would  you let me bite your breasts for $100?"      "are you nuts?!" she replies, and keeps walking away.         he turns around, runs around the block and gets to the corner before she does.       "would you let me bite your breasts for $1,000?" he asks again.      "listen you; i'm not that kind of woman! got it?"       so the little old jewish  man runs around the next block and faces her again.       "would you let me bite your breasts -  just once - for  $10,000?!"       she thinks about it for a while and says, "hmmmmm, $10,000... ok, just  once, but not here. let's go to that dark alley over there."       so they go into the alley, where she takes off her blouse to reveal the most perfect breasts in the world.       as soon as he sees them, he grabs them and starts caressing them,  fondling them slowly,  kissing them, licking them, burying his face in  them - but not biting them.       the woman finally gets annoyed and asks, 'well? are you gonna bite them or not?'       "nah," says the little old jewish man... "costs too much!"	2

a man walks into a bar... ...with a little monkey on his shoulder. man orders a beer and the little monkey is excitedly looking around at all the sights. man sips on his beer and the monkey spies a bowl of peanuts at one end of the bar so he scampers over and proceeds to scarf down all the peanuts. bartender sees all this, looks a little annoyed but keeps quiet. the monkey has returned to sit on the mans shoulder again, continues to look around excitedly and spies a bowl of popcorn at the other end of the bar. the monkey again hops off the mans shoulder, runs over and eats all the popcorn then runs back to the man and hops back up on his shoulder. the man continues to sip on his beer. the bartender sighs, but again doesn’t say anything.  behind the man, a pool game is being played which has caught the monkeys attention. the monkey jumps onto the pool table, scurries over and grabs the cue ball, pops it into his mouth and swallows it. at this point the patrons are grumbling and the bartender tells the man, “listen, i didn’t say anything when your monkey ate all the peanuts, or when he ate all the popcorn. but now he’s swallowed the cue ball and my patrons can’t play pool!” the man apologizes profusely and offers to pay for the damages and leaves. a few weeks later, the same man walks into the same bar with the same monkey on his shoulder. man orders a beer while the monkey again proceeds to scope the place out. at the end of the bar is a bowl of cherries. the monkey runs over to the bowl, grabs a cherry, sticks the cherry in his rear then pulls it out and eats it. the bartender is horrified and turns to the man, “did you just see what your nasty little monkey did?!?! he stuck a cherry in his butt, pulled it back out and then ate it!” the man replies, “yeah...ever since the cue ball incident he measures everything first.”	2

"*now don't forget, mark, you promised me a big surprise,*" said the bride.   unable to say a word, mark turned out the lights, unstrapped his wooden leg, slipped into bed, and placed his wife's hand on the stump.

she was in good hands    a girl turned up on a blind date only to find that the guy had no arms or legs. apparently he was a military vet who lost his limbs in action in some war.  still not wanting to be rude or seem politically incorrect, she decided that it's just dinner and it couldn't hurt.  much to her surprise, the guy was a great conversationalist and really interesting and they just clicked.  they got back to her house and things get hot and heavy.  as the clothes start to come off the guy hesitates a bit and asks that the lights to be turned off because he doesn't want to be so vulnerable on a first date.  she understandably agrees and the lights are turned off and she experiences the most intense lovemaking of her life. the orgasms were intense.  in the morning she told him that he was the greatest lover he ever had. he thanked her for a great night and for her kind words. he then confessed, "i didn't want you to find out right away, but i also lost my penis in the war."  she was flabbergasted. but how then? he couldn't finger her or use hands, and it was certainly not a tongue she felt last night.  she was stumped.	1

lawyer & the red neck   a lawyer and a redneck are sitting next to each other on a long flight.   the lawyer asks if the redneck would like to play a fun game.   the redneck is tired and just wants to take a nap, so he politely  declines and tries to catch a few winks.   the lawyer persists, that the game is a lot of fun. 'i ask you a  question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me only $5; you ask  me one, and if i don't know the answer, i will pay you $500.   this catches the redneck's attention and to keep the lawyer quiet,  agrees to play the game.   the lawyer asks the first question. 'what's the distance from the earth  to the moon?'   the redneck doesn't say a word, reaches in his pocket pulls out a  five-dollar bill, and hands it to the lawyer.   now, it's the redneck's turn. he asks the lawyer, 'w hat goes up a hill  with three legs, and comes down with four?'   the lawyer uses his laptop, searches all references. he uses the air  phone; he searches the net and even the library of congress. he sends  e-mails to all the smart friends he knows, all to no avail.   after one hour of searching he finally gives up. he wakes up the redneck  and hands him $500.   the redneck pockets the $500 goes right back to sleep.   the lawyer is going nuts not knowing the answer. he wakes the redneck up  and asks, 'well, so what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down  with four?'   the redneck reaches in his pocket, hands the lawyer $5 and goes back to  sleep.	1

"there. now you have a bayonet. if the enemy gets close just yell stabbity. stabbity. stabbity!". the soldier still perplexed ventured onto the battlefield nonetheless. he saw his enemy on the horizon and began shouting "bangity! bangity! bangity!" to his surprise the enemy was dropping like flies. except for one. they kept coming. getting closer and closer. once the enemy was right upon the soldier he began jabbing his wicker bayonet screaming, "stabbity! stabbity! stabbity!". but to no avail. the enemy rolled right over the soldier crushing every bone in his body and pressing him deep into the soil. as the enemy passed over him he could hear them saying, "tankity! tankity! tankity!"	1

joe wanted to buy a motorbike  but he doesn't have much luck until one day, he comes across a honda road bike with a 'for sale' sign on it.  the bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. it is shiny and in absolute mint condition.  he immediately buys it, and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.  'well, it's quite simple, really,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike  is outside and it's gonna rain, rub vaseline on the chrome. it protects  it from the rain.'  and he hands joe a jar of vaseline.  that night, his girlfriend, sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. naturally, they take the bike there.  but just before they enter the house, sandra stops him and says, 'i  have to tell you something about my family before we go in.'  'when we eat dinner, we don't talk. in fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'  'no problem,' he says. and in they go.  joe is shocked. right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.  in the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.  they sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.  as dinner progresses, joe decides to take advantage of the situation.  so he leans over and kisses sandra.  no one says a word.  so he reaches over and fondles her breasts.  still, nobody says a word. so he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes  off, throws her on the table, and shags her right there, in front of  her parents.  his girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is  obviously livid, and her mother horrified when he sits back down, but no  one says a word.  he looks at her mother..  'she's got a great body,' he thinks.  so he grabs the mother, bends her over the dinner table, pulls down her  knickers, and screws her every way possible right there on the dinner table.  after she has a big orgasm, he sits down again.  now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, the mother is pleasantly beaming.  but still, total silence.  all of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.  joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of vaseline from his pocket...  suddenly the father shouted....  'ok i'll do the fucking dishes!	3

a manchester united fan, liverpool fan and an everton fan were caught drinking in saudi arabia.... an everton fan, a liverpool fan and a manchester united fan were all in saudi arabia drinking a smuggled crate of booze.  all of a sudden saudi police rushed in and arrested them.  for their punishment the saudi arabia sheik decided that the punishment should be 20 lashes with a whip.  as they were preparing for their punishment, the sheik suddenly said: "it is my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping."  the manchester united fan was first in line (he had consumed the least), so he thought about it for a while and then said: "please tie a pillow to my back."  this was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through it.  the manchester united fan had to be carried away bleeding and crying when the punishment was done.  the liverpool fan was next up (he almost finished a half-keg), and after watching the scene, said: "choice! please fix two pillows on my back."  but even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again.  the everton fan was the last one up (he had finished off the keg), but before he could say anything, the sheikh turned to him and said: "you are from a most beautiful part of england, your city has some of the best and most loyal football fans in the world. for this, you may have two wishes!"  "cheers mate, your most royal and merciful highness", the everton fan replied.  "in recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes."  "not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave." the sheik said with an admiring look on his face.  "if 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. and your second wish? what is it to be?" the sheik asked.  "tie that liverpool fan to my back..."	2

as it's my 5th birthday, mommy, will you tell me the story of where i came from? *the mom replied:* hmmm, ok sure, how can i explain... well you see sweety, mommy and daddy love each other very much, so one beautiful spring morning mommy told daddy she had a seed, a tiny little seed, and i thought we should grow that little seed into something special.   that night daddy fertilised it which helps the little seed start to grow, then every day me and daddy took care of that little seed; we gave it food and water, we played music for it to listen to, we made sure it was healthy, we talked to it about how much we loved it, we took it into the garden for fresh air and sun, daddy even used to sing to it. we tended and cared for that little seed every single day because it was super special.  then after 9 whole months that little seed had grown into a beautiful amazing plant... so we took the plant, dried it, smoked it, and got so wasted we fucked bareback and that's where you came from.	3

an irishman walks into a bar in dublin, orders three pints of guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. when he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. the bartender approaches and tells him, "you know, a pint goes flat after i draw it. "it would taste better if you bought one at a time." the irishman replies, "well, you see, i have two brothers. one is in america, the other is in australia, and i’m in dublin. when we all left home, we promised that we’d drink this way to remember the days we drank together. so i drink one for each o'me brothers and one for me self." the bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. the irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way: he orders three pints and drinks them in turn.  one day, he comes in and orders two pints. all the other regulars take notice and fall silent. when he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, "i don’t want to intrude on your grief, but i wanted to offer my condolences on your loss." the irishman looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns and he laughs. "oh, no, everybody's just fine!"  he explains, "it's just that my wife had us join that baptist church and i had to quit drinking. but it hasn't affected me brothers though."	3

a team of archaeologists were excavating in israel when they found a cave with the symbols of a woman, a donkey, a shovel, a fish and a star of david on the wall. pointing to the first drawing, the head of the team declared: 'this indicates that these people were family oriented and held women in high position. the donkey shows that they were intelligent enough to use animals to till the soil. the shovel means that they were able to forge tools. even further proof of high intelligence is the fish: if famine hit the land, they would take to the sea for food. the last symbol is the star of david, telling us they were hebrews.'  however one of his fellow archaeologists begged to disagree. 'hebrew is read from right to left,' he explained. 'the symbols say: "holy mackerel, dig the ass on that chick!"'	3

an old.. dirty whaling joke. a male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of japan when they noticed a whaling ship. the male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. he said to the female whale, "lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink." they tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.  soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, "let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore." at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. "look," she said, "i went along with the blow job, but i absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."	1

quiz of the week: which star called out disinformation? https://t.co/6atet65ysn	0
a group of nuns were remodeling their church. today they were painting the walls. they didn't want to get paint on their habits (their nun clothes), so they decided to lock the doors and paint naked...  ...they were butt naked and painting when suddenly someone knocked on the cathedral doors. sister mary explained to her sisters that every afternoon a poor blind man would come to pray...   "who is it?" she asked.  "blind man" was the only reply.  the nuns all looked at each other and shrugged their shoulders. "if he is blind, what does it matter if we let him in to pray? he won't even know we are naked."  they agreed and unlocked the door. the man walked in and took a look around at all naked nuns standing in front of him. "god damm, sister mary, nice rack," he said, "now where should i hang the blinds."	3

"my god!" gasped the visitor "what is that man doing!?"  the doctor quickly flipped through his notes. "oh, you see, this man has an incredibly rare disorder where if he stops masturbating, his heart will explode."  "oh my," said the visitor "that poor man. what a terrible life to lead."  with that, they continue down the hall until they happen across another room with the door wide open. the man inside is laying back in bliss while a pretty young nurse is enthusiastically sucking his dick.  "oh my god!" screams the visitor "what on earth is going on here? this is completely unacceptable!"  once again, the doctor flips through his notes. "oh. you see, this patient has the same disorder as the last one, but his health insurance is significantly better."	3

clocks, trump, and heaven a guy dies and goes to heaven. it's a slow day for st. peter, so, upon passing the entrance test, st. peter says, "i'm not very busy today, why don't you let me show you around?" the guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer. st. peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the reading room, the library, the observatory, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a huge room filled with clocks. the guy asks, "what's up with all these clocks?" st. peter explains, "everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. when a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the gates to be judged." the guy thinks this makes sense but notices some of the clocks are running faster than others. he asks why this is? st. peter explains, "every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds up his clock." this also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before he leaves and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. on this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. so he asks, "what's the story with that clock?" "oh, that," st. peter replies, "that's donald trump’s clock. we decided to use it as a ceiling fan."	2

"minds and behinds."  "lost souls and assholes."  "analysis and anal cysts."  "queers and rears."  "nuts and butts."  "freaks and cheeks."  "loons and moons."   none of these satisfied one side or the other, but they finally settled on   "dr. smith and dr. jones, odds and ends."	3

a priest, a lawyer, and an engineer, were each sentenced to death by guillotine. the priest went first, and he says "please. allow me to lie facing up, so that i might face towards god as i am about to join him."  the guards allow it, and place his head through the slot.  the guard pulls the lever and the blade comes down but stops just inches short of the priest's head. it's regarded as such a freak occurrence that the priest is pardoned and set free.  next up is the lawyer.  “heck, it worked for the priest. put me in face up too," he says.  again the guards allow it, and again they pull the lever.  the blade comes falling down, but again stops just short of the lawyer's neck. like the priest, the lawyer is granted a pardon and set free, due to his marvelously good turn of fortune.  finally the engineer is brought out.  "if you don't mind, could you put me in facing up?" he asks.  the guards agree and place him in the machine.  the guard grabs a hold of the lever, but just before he can pull, the engineer points up and says:  "oh hey, i think i see where the problem is..."	3

who's the boss of the body? one day, certain parts of the body got into an argument over who was in charge. the eyes said "well, we're in charge because without us, the body wouldn't be able to interact with the world."  "are you kidding??" said the legs. "without us, you eyes would have nothing to see except a ceiling. we take you places!"  "guys, this is embarrassing," said the brain. "if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't walk or process anything. obviously, i'm the boss here."  this caused an uproar and all parts of the body began to shout. only the anus kept quiet. and all the anus did was close itself up. and waited.   the body became constipated. the eyes rolled back, the legs became weak and the brain was frazzled.   which goes to show that if you want to be the boss, sometimes you have to be an asshole.	1

a joke that’s got me various death threats so there was a horse, and this horse was really talented. he was great on guitar. one day he found himself watching youtube and stumbled upon a jimi hendrix song which inspired him to start a cover. he practised this cover really hard, eventually becoming inspired to create a cover of a whole jimi hendrix album.  he worked on this cover real hard, finally filming himself and uploading his hard work to youtube. it blows up, gets load of views, people love a horse playing guitar right? but something is missing so he goes to his friend the sheep and says “hey man you’re the best bass player i know, would you join my cover band?” to which the sheep agrees. they recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. it sounds great, blows up and gets loads of views.   still something is missing so he goes to his friend the cow and goes “hey man you’re like amazing at drums, could you join my cover band? it’d mean a lot!” and the cow says, “of course, you’re my buddy and that sounds great!” so again, they recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. it sounds great, blows up and gets loads of views.   but still something is missing. so finally the horse goes to his friend the chicken and says “hey man i think you’re the last element missing in our cover band - wanna be our vocalist?” and the chicken’s flattered. they recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. it sounds great, blows up and gets millions of views. it sounds almost as good as the original - by now everyone knows these guys have a talent and theyre forming a fanbase.   they have a healthy career as a cover band, maintaining and growing their fanbase infinitely. so one day the horse says to his band, “guys. we have all this talent - why don’t we start writing our own music? what is there to lose?” so they start writing their own songs. by this point they’re world-famous, playing tours, signing album covers and getting papped.  then one day the horse gets a call.  “hi, i’m ellen degeneres and i was wondering if your band would like to join me on my show? one of you will have to come on over to set things up first.” they’re gobsmacked. they’ve finally made it, invited on the ellen show. after a brief discussion they agree the horse should have the honours of setting up with ellen, as he has founded their band. so he flies on over in a private jet, spends all day with ellen practising, sets up and goes back to his fancy five-star all inclusive hotel and pops open a bottle of champagne to himself and calls his friends up, saying “everything’s all ready, come on down.”   halfway through his third bottle, he gets a call.  “hi - is this horse? i’m so sorry. there’s been an accident. your friends died in a plane crash.”  he’s devastated. his whole life, his best friends, everything he’s worked for. gone. in a flash. nothing remained. he decides - he has to kill himself. so he gets out of bed, already drunk, and wanders down the street in a dressing gown, stumbling into the shittiest, cheapest, most run down looking bar he could find in town.   he sits at the bar and says “a vodka on the rocks”.   and the bartender goes, “hey man, why the long face?”	3

a scary midnight story a taxi driver is going home at midnight when he decides to take a shortcut through a cemetery. he's driving slowly through the dark when he suddenly stops in shock. in front of his headlights is a lady in white hailing him down.   before he has time to think, the woman climbs in and says in a low whisper, "i'm so glad you're here. nobody ever goes by here anymore."  there's something really creepy about the lady, and the cabbie doesn't talk with her, just drives to the address she gives. he's so nervous and jittery that he starts swerving hard along the country roads.  embarrassed that he's so scared, he turns around to apologize for his driving-- but the woman is gone.   terrified, the cabbie floors it until his heart stops beating like a jackhammer, and he catches his breath at a stop sign.   starting to think it was all a dream, he looks back to make sure no one is in his car. but he sees the woman in white again. this time, her eyes are dripping blood, and she starts to reach out to him with a pale hand.   this starts the cabbie again and he drives like a lunatic, not knowing what he's doing in his fright. he turns to see if the lady is close, and then hits the brakes-- she's gone again!   shaking, he pulls a flask and takes a swig of whiskey to steady his nerves, when cold fingers touch his shoulder. he looks behind him and sees the woman's face completely covered with blood now, staring down at him behind a veil of disheveled black hair.   the cabbie panics and drives like a madman, his only instinct is to escape. when he finally calms down, he stops and looks behind him to see that the lady has disappeared again. but as soon as he turns back toward the road, he notices that the lady is now seated beside him in the front passenger seat, blood covering her from head to toe and dripping from her open mouth.   crazed with fear now, the woman staring him down, the cabbie drives the final stretch to their destination like hell on wheels. when they get there, he collapses back into his seat, all the fight gone out of him.   the blood-covered lady leans over and whispers, in a creaking voice from the edge of the afterlife, saying,   "hey, cabbie. you gotta fix that back door, i fell out and had to catch up to you three times."	2

the hunter a man went bear hunting one day.   deep in the mountains, he saw a gigantic drizzly resting.   he took aim, and pulled the trigger.   he went to where he had seen the bear,  but it was nowhere to be found.   he felt a tap on his shoulder, turned and saw the bear  "i am so tired of hunters trying to kill me,  so you have a choice. you blow me, or i kill you."  the hunter did the deed, and the bear left happy.   after a month the hunter returned to get his revenge. he got a larger rifle, and laid in wait for the bear.   after days, he found the bear again, took aim, and shot.   he went to where the bear was, and again it had dissapeared. he felt a tap on his shoulder, turned, and again saw the bear.   "you didnt learn your lesson last time? same options, your choice."  the hunter did the deed again, and left humiliated.   almost a year later he returned. he prepared even more, getting explosives, traps, and an elephant rifle.   he set up all of his traps in a clearing, and made sure to bait it with a feast.   he laid waiting for the bear for a week, barely eating, and not moving. at last, the bear came sniffing around, and stopped in the clearing for the feast.   in one move, he activated the explosives, the traps, and shot the bear. a cloud of smoke and dust flew up and stayed for 10 minutes.   the hunter went to the clearing to finally claim his prize. and he felt the tap on his shoulder. he turned, and there was the bear, completely unharmed with a smirk on his face.   "let's be honest, this isn't about the hunting anymore, is it?"	2

centuries upon centuries ago, a group of nuns lived in a secluded convent deep in the woods. centuries upon centuries ago, a group of nuns lived in a secluded convent deep in the woods.  the convent provided all of their basic needs: cows for milk, sheep for cheese, grain for bread, and even bees for honey.  however, one day a deadly plague swept through the land, infecting all of the sisters.  desperate for a cure, their mother superior prayed continuously for seven days and seven nights for a miracle.  on the last day of praying, the mother superior opened her eyes to the sight of one of her beehives glowing with a brilliant blue flame.  being a person of profound faith, she immediately rushed over to the hive and started scooping out globs of golden liquid and feeding it to her sisters.  within seconds, all of their fevers had subsided and all of their plague sores had disappeared.  as they started rejoicing at this miracle, an angel appeared and told them that because of the strength of their faith, god had deemed them all worthy of this magical elixir of healing.  and as long as they kept it a secret to all but those who were pure of heart, god would continue to bless them with this miracle cure-all.  and so the sisters of the convent pledged to keep it a secret, sharing its existence and passing down the care of the hive to only the purest and most devout nuns, generation after generation.  however, as the years grew, the world's faith dwindled until all that remained of the convent was a lone sister of god.  desperate to keep her convent's tradition and secret alive, she decided one day to journey out of the woods in search of a girl who was pure of heart.  after watching many of the townsfolk, she finally saw a young girl who showed great promise.  so the nun approached the girl and explained that she was the keeper of an amazing secret, but that this secret could only be shared with a pure soul.  "well, how do i know if i'm pure enough?" the young girl asked.  the sister thought about this for a moment and replied, "try praying continuously for seven days and seven nights, stopping only for sleep and food when necessary.  at the end, surely god will send us some sign of your purity."  and so the young girl locked herself in her room and did as the nun asked.  but after seven days and seven nights, neither saw any sign from god.  "hmmm," thought the nun.  "maybe you didn't pray long enough?  try praying continuously, but this time for 30 days and 30 nights."  trusting the holy woman, the young girl agreed and locked herself in her room again, this time for 30 full days and 30 full nights.  however, once again, no sign from god appeared.  starting to lose faith herself, the old nun suggested that the girl simply needed to pray even longer -- this time for a full year to once and for all prove to god the purity of her soul.  reluctantly, the young girl agreed.  but after six months of near-constant prayer, the girl had finally reached her breaking point.  enraged, she confronted the old nun.  "you told me that if i prayed continuously for an entire year, this would prove the purity of my soul and you would finally share with me some amazing secret!  but after six whole months, i've had enough!  either tell me what this amazing secret is or i quit!"  dejected and having lost all hope, the old sister sadly looked at the young girl and replied, "it's a nun of yore's beeswax."	2

a man playing on a new golf course got confused as to what hole he was on. he saw a lady playing ahead of him, so he walked up to her and asked if she knew what hole he was playing. she replied, “i’m on the 7th hole and you’re a hole behind me, so you must be on the 6th hole.” he thanked her and went back to his golf.  on the back nine, the same thing happened and he approached the lady, again with the same request.  she said, “i’m on the 14th, you are a hole behind me, so you must be on the 13th.”  once again, he thanked her.  he finished his round, went into the club house and saw the lady sitting at the end of the bar.  he went up to her and said, “let me buy you a drink to show my appreciation for your help.”  he started a conversation and asked her what kind of work she did.  she said she was in sales and he said he was in sales also.  he asked what she sold.  she replied, “if i told you, you would only laugh.”  “no, i wouldn’t.” he said.  she said, “i sell tampons.”  with that he fell on the floor laughing so hard.  she said, “see, i knew you would laugh.”  “that’s not what i’m laughing at!” he replied. “i’m a toilet paper salesman, so i’m still one hole behind you!”	3

a man is looking around a pet store, when he comes across an octopus on sale for $10,000. he asks the store owner why the octopus is so expensive to which the owner replies, “oh thats no ordinary octopus. he’s special.” he puts a guitar in front of the octopus and the octopus continues get on top of it and use his tentacles to play stairway to heaven in its entirety. the man is dumbfounded and says, “this octopus can play the guitar?” the store owner replies, “not just the guitar. he can play any and every instrument known to man,” and proceeds to place a harp in front of it. the octopus plays a beautiful song on the harp, and the man figures he can use this octopus to bet people that his octopus could play any instrument and easily get back his $10,000. he buys the octopus and heads over to the bar.  when he gets to the bar he jumps on top of a table, holding the octopus high above his head, and announces, “i will bet anybody in the bar, any amount of money, that this octopus can play any instrument you set in front of him.” the bartender rolls out a piano, and says, “i’ll bet you $100 he cant play this.” so the man sets the octopus on the piano, and it plays the pachelbel’s canon in d perfectly. impressed, the bartender hands the man a crisp $100 bill. a drunk man jumps up and yells, “i bet you $5000 he cant play the drums.” the bartender brings out a drumset used for open mic night, and the octopus is sat on the seat, and continues to play  an incredible drum solo that leaves everyone in awe. the bar owner comes up to him and says, “i have an instrument behind the bar, and ill bet you $10,000 your octopus cant play it.” the man agrees and the bartender pulls out a set of bagpipes. unbothered he sets the octopus on the bagpipes and waits eagerly. the octopus squirms around the bagpipes, using its tentacles to make some kind of melody. theres a few notes here and there, but no real discernible melody. the octopus continues to roll around and squirm around the bagpipes, when the bar owner shouts excitedly, “i win! he cant play the bagpipes, and you owe me $10,000!” the man, completely unfazed, replies, “be patient. once he realizes he can’t fuck it, he’ll play it.”	2

why was 6 afraid of 7? 6 never did trust 7. sure, they worked closely together, but 7 always seemed at odds with him. 6 always preferred the company of 4, a perfect 10 of a duo, even though 2 kept them apart. but when it came to 7? 6 always summed it up to bad luck. then, 6 found the truth. 6 respected 9, even though lewd jokes always seemed to be made about the two. 6 found that 3 and himself could come together and be seen as equal to 9. when 9 was removed, 6 had a very negative feeling. some were considered prime suspects in 9’s death. 2, 3, 5, and 7. 6 knew it had to be 7. his involvement with 9 added up two well. 6 snuck into 7’s house. he looked up from the floorboards, and found himself under 7. an admittedly improper position for him, but 6 saw the proof he wanted: 9’s body, half devoured. 7 was a cannibal... 7 8 9. 6 has spent the remainder of his days terrified of 7, worried that someday 7 will learn what 6 knows... and promptly solve his problem.	2

this joke got me fired when i worked as a cook. credit goes to jackie “the joke man” martling a husband goes to his wife and says “you’re either going hunting with me, sucking my cock or i’m fucking you in the ass. i’m gonna go get the dogs ready and i’ll be back for your answer.”   after a bit of time, he returns to his wife who defiantly says to him “i’m not going hunting and there’s no way you’re fucking me in the ass!”  “alright then, guess you’re sucking my cock.”  so she starts to suck him off and quickly spits it out and looks up at him.   “your dick tastes like shit!”  “yeah well, the dogs didn’t want to go hunting either.”  author’s notes: wow! never thought this would get this much feedback. a few clarifications for anyone asking:  1. i was in the back end of the kitchen with a fellow cook during a quieter lunch hour when this happened. the place i was working at had been opened less than a month. we had been swapping jokes for a bit before i let this one loose and instead of it being muffled by the sounds of the deep fryer, grill, etc., it was projected out into the main seating area through the ticket window like a speaker.   2. a customer was the one who ultimately complained to the manager and i was gracefully fired the following day when i walked in to start my shift. i had come from working at a bar previously, so the fact that more sensitive people/families were the ones showing up completely slipped my mind as i was in the back cracking joke with the other chef (a  10+ year veteran of the industry.)the owner was pretty cool with everything all things considered, but explained that they just couldn’t take the risk of something else happening. i even got to say goodbye to everyone before i left, including the head chef who originally hired me, and everyone was really supportive and understanding.   3. i got a new job shortly after in a warehouse and have been much better off since. i make more money, work less hours, have actual benefits and my bosses are way less uptight due to the nature of the job. it was the strangest blessing in disguise i’ve ever received as i don’t know how much longer i wouldn’t lasted in the food industry either way. so in the end, everything worked out.	3

[long]so, a pianist walks into his local jazz bar... as he's been down on his luck and is looking for work. he asks one of the waitresses there to speak to the manager, who he approaches and asks,   "are you the dumb fucker that runs this shit hole of a bar?"   the manager, taken very much aback, responds, "excuse me? i am the manager, yes, can you please stop swearing in front of my patrons?"  "good! 'cause i need some fucking work and i'm half decent on the keys!"   and he sits down and begins to play the sweetest, grooviest, bluest-of-blues tracks the bar manager has ever heard.   "d..did you write that? that was beautiful! what's it called?"   "that i did! it's called, why don't you go fuck the ass off of a low flying duck you insolent cunt?"   aghast, the manager gestures for the pianist to hush, and quietly asks "do you know any jazz? anything a little more intricate?"   "'course i do!"   and again the pianist plays the most delightful and devilish jazz piece the manager has heard.   bracing for the name of this track, he asks "well what do you call it?"   "i'll fuck your mother's hairy minge under the cover of pale moonlight!"   appalled, though aware of the man's talents, the manager offers him a spot on the bill, on the proviso that he doesn't name his songs after he plays them, and the pianist happily agrees.   *later that evening...*   about 5 from showtime, the pianist has set himself up on stage and is perusing the crowd, gauging the energy of the room, when he suddenly spies the most beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous woman he's ever seen - tight fitting red dress with red lipstick to match, high heels - you name it. after slight deliberation, and with the 5 minutes to spare, the pianist decides it a good idea to go try rub one out in the men's room, to "deal with the stress of performing", as he justifies it.   well, lo and behold it takes a little longer than 5 minutes, and the manager comes bursting into the bathroom (on the other side of the stall, mind you), and yells  "christ mate, where have you been?! the people are getting agitated - you've a show to play! don't you fuck this up for me!"  before leaving the bathroom abrutply.   the pianist rages on with the task at hand, and after wrapping up he bursts from the bathroom back onto the stage and sets right to playing.   after his first song, the lovely woman he had spied earlier approaches him from the side of the stage, leans into his ear and whispers   "excuse me, do you know your dick is hanging out of your pants and there's cum dribbling onto your shoe?"  stunned, the pianist turns to her and says   "know it?! i wrote that fucking song!"	2

a cowboy had spent many days crossing the montana prairies without water. his horse had already died of thirst. he's crawling along the dusty ground, certain that he has breathed his last breath, when all of a sudden he sees an object sticking out of the ground several yards ahead of him.   he crawls to the object, pulls it out of the ground and discovers what looks to be an old briefcase. he opens it and out pops a genie.   but this is no ordinary genie. she is wearing an irs id badge and a dull grey dress. there's a calculator in her pocketbook.  she has a pencil tucked behind one ear. 'well, cowboy,' says the genie, 'you know how i work....you have three wishes.'   'i'm not falling for this,' said the cowboy, 'i'm not going to trust an irs genie.'   'what do you have to lose? you've got no transportation, and it looks like you're a goner anyway!'   the cowboy thinks about this for a minute and decides that the genie is right.   'ok! i wish i were along-side a lush spring with plenty of food and drink.'   --poof-- the cowboy finds himself beside the most beautiful spring he has ever seen, and he's surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies.   'ok, cowpoke, what's your second wish.'  'my second wish is that i was rich...beyond my wildest dreams.'   --poof-- the cowboy finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare gold coins and precious gems.   'ok, cowpuncher, you have just one more wish.  better make it a good one!'   after thinking for a few minutes, the cowboy says, 'i wish that no matter where i go, beautiful women will want and need me.'   -- poof -- he was turned into a tampon.   moral of the story:  if the u.s. government offers to help you, there's going to be a string attached.	1

til older forms of english kept latin’s gender-specific suffixes -tor and -trix; tor is for men and trix is for women. so a male pilot is an aviator, a female pilot is an aviatrix. a male fighter is a gladiator, a female fighter is a gladiatrix. this contrasts with the modern system, where tor is for both men and women, and trix are for kids.	2

'so, you're the new hen, huh? how's your first day here?'  'not bad,' replied bob the hen, 'but i have this strange feeling inside. like i'm gonna explode!'  'you're ovulating,' explained the rooster.  'don't tell me you've never laid an egg before? '  'never,' said bob.  'well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'it's no big deal.'  bob did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg! bob was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. he soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming.  as he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yell..... bob, wake up. you shit the bed!'	2

a wealthy old man lays on his death bed, his 3 sons by his side. "my boys, to just one of you i will leave my fortune. each of you take a duck to the market. whoever can sell it for the highest price will be worthy of everything i leave behind"  the first son, a successful business man in his own right, takes his duck, and gets $20 for it. a good price for a duck. the second son, one of the best lawyers in the country, thinks he can outdo that. and he does. $30! a ridiculous price for a duck.  the third son grabs his duck. the rest of the family try not to laugh, as they know the least successful son will have no luck.  and sure enough, he couldn't sell his duck. the market had closed, he walked back to his car sadly. a woman of the night  appears and offers him a good time, but he had no money. "the duck will suffice" she says. and it was the best she ever had. "if you can do that to me again, you can have the duck back!" of course he does, then heads home with his duck.   sadly on the way, the duck flies out the window and is killed by a truck. they pull over and the truck driver is so sorry he offers the pretending to be devastated man $50.  the third son heads home, slaps his $50 on the table and watches everyone stare in amazement. "how?" they asked.  "wellll" he said with a massive grin, "i got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck and fifty bucks for a fucked up duck."	3
this year in heaven the christmas celebration was also a costume party. everyone dressed up. many people came as movie characters, from gandalf the grey (and white) to jason bourne to black widow to harry potter. alan rickman went as hans gruber, which made st. peter exclaim "see, die hard is a christmas movie!" st. peter was dressed as the "fragile" lamp from a christmas story. moses showed up as charlton heston's version of himself, while charlton heston dressed up as an ape. ruth bader ginsburg came as hermione granger. (although she insisted that she was dressed as the book character, not the movie character, which explained the teeth.)  there were also some great couple's costumes. alex trebek and sean connery dressed up as each other and re-enacted bits from the celebrity jeopardy sketches. the wright brothers dressed up as the super mario brothers. carrie fisher and debbie reynolds came as captain kirk and mister spock. prince dressed up as dave chappelle's version of rick james and david bowie came as "super freakonomics."   naturally, everyone was looking for the guest of honor. if anyone would have a fantastic costume, it would be jesus.  however, try as they might, no one could figure out jesus' costume among the multitudes of party guests. there were, of course, plenty of people who dressed as jesus, and some wondered if jesus had gone full meta. he didn't, but as it turned out charlie chaplin did dress up as jesus and placed third in the jesus look-a-like contest.   finally, as the party was drawing to a close, it was time for everyone to unmask. joan of arc was the one dressed as bigfoot. alan turing was predator. richard pryor was the burning bush. thomas jefferson and john adams, who had long since made up and become the best of friends, were the unicorn.  eventually there was only one costume left.  as jesus pulled off the matt damon mask, everyone realized that christ was bourne on christmas day.	3

your life pursuit long ago in a distant land an explorer and his large team of bearers, trackers, hunters, cooks, handymen, translators and so on came upon a village of people never before known to the outside world.  luckily the translators were able to communicate with the people and soon the explorer was talking with the villagers, whom called themselves ... well, nevermind that as it's unpronounceable by outsiders.  the explorer offered the villagers gifts of whatever he had with him.  to his astonishment, the villagers chose things that were the most mundane and least valuable to the team.  as the villagers were each coming to choose their gifts, the explorer observed that each of them had many white and grey spots and drips on their bodies and clothes (what clothes they wore, anyway), and that each of them had an odd and slightly unpleasant odor about them.  the older the villager, the more spots on their person, and there was a very high portion of elderly people, of well advanced age.  as the last of the villagers trickled by, the explorer spoke with the representatives of the village.  he asked about why they all chose the least valuable items.  the representatives said "walk with us, and see our land as we speak", to which the explorer agreed, bringing several of his team along.  as they walked, the explorer noticed that the growth and good abundance of this land was vastly superior to all other land he'd ever seen in all of his travels around the world.  "we are a simple and happy people. all we need is provided to us by the great foo in the sky, whom we do not anger."  the explorer obviously recognized this as being some spiritual mumbo jumbo, but of course held his tongue and remained polite.  just then, the explorer observed out of the corner of his eye one of his team collapsing.  upon inspection, the team member was dead!  the explorer was concerned and asked the villagers if they knew what happened.  "he angered the great foo in the sky" was all they said.  the explorer had already found the villagers to be warm and friendly, so he was sure there was no foul play and the team member must have stepped on something, or been bitten by a small poisonous creature, or the like.  they continued walking and talking.  thinking of the odor he'd noticed from the people, the explorer offered "can i give you the gift of soap and teach you how to make it?"  "we are a simple people, but we know of soap.  we do not anger the great foo in the sky."  while he contemplated this, another one of his team fell over, also dead!  "kindly villagers, would you please tell me what is killing my team members?"  "he angered the great foo in the sky" they solemnly said.  it was obvious to the explorer that the villagers are superstitious and clueless, but he couldn't help thinking about the fact that there were so many elderly in the village.  as he was thinking to himself, he spotted an unusually large bird soaring in the sky rather far above them.  what could be killing his men so readily, but has not killed the villagers such that there are so many elders.  looking up at the very large bird the explorer asked "what type of bird is that?"  while the villager answered "that is foo" a bird turd landed on the explorers shoulder.  the explorer moved his hand to brush the bird turd off of him, but the villager quickly grabbed his arm and said "do not anger the great foo in the sky."  __the moral of the story is:  if the foo shits, wear it__	1

jesus and a parrot there was once a man who had bought an incredibly intelligent european parrot.  he thought, hell, it's so intelligent he could give it some chores. he thought the most efficient way to make the parrot obedient is to threaten it; saying that if it disobeys him, he'll nail it right next to jesus christ himself for 10 years.  he told the parrot to order a 10x10 foot stack of lumber, however, the parrot, being from europe, ordered 10x10 meters (32x32 ft). the man, not being able to pay for all the lumber, was outraged with the parrot and, as promised, nailed it next to j. h. c. for the next 10 years.  on the cross, the parrot asked jesus: "hey, jesus, how long have ya been here on this cross?"  jesus replies: "for quite some time now, around 2000 years..."  p: jesus christ! how much fuckin lumber did you order??!!	2

the whales a male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of japan when they noticed a whaling ship. the male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. he said to the female whale, "lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink. they tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank. soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female "lets swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore." at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. "look", she said, "i went along with the blow job, but i absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen".	1

two men in the woods these 2 guys are out walking through the woods, they come upon a clearing with a big hole in the middle of it. the first guy says to the second "i wonder how deep this hole is" "i don't know, let's find something to toss in here and see if we can hear it hit the bottom", says the second. so they go find a big rock, toss it down the hole. they stand there and listen and listen, but they never hear it hit. so they wander around a bit more and find a great big branch that had fallen off of a tree. they drag it back to the hole, and toss it in. they listen and listen, but they never hear it hit. so they decide to go find the biggest thing they can wrestle over to it. they wander around until they find a gigantic log. they drag it through the woods and chuck it in. they stand there and listen and listen, when suddenly this goat comes tearing through the woods and jumps straight into the hole. as they stand there trying to figure out what in the heck just happened, an old man steps into the clearing. "hey, have you fellas seen my goat?" "yeah, we just saw him run outta the woods and jump straight into this hole" the old man replies "nah, couldn't have been my goat, my goat was tied to a log"	3

it’s getting crowded in heaven, so one day saint peter decides to only accept people who make him laugh. a man came walking up to the pearly gates, and saint peter said to him:  “alright bud, you’re only getting in today if you can make me laugh, so why don’t you tell me about how you died.”  the man looked at saint peter and said, “oh man, it was awful! i was absolutely sure my wife was having an affair, so i left work early to come home and try to catch her in the act. when i got home, sure as shit there she was, naked on the bed! i looked all over the apartment, but i couldn’t find the guy anywhere. so i went outside on our 25th story balcony, and there he was!! hanging over the edge by his fingertips! so i ran inside, and grabbed my hammer and ran back outside and started smashing his hands and fingers with it! he finally let go, and he fell down 25 stories but he landed in some bushes, so i ran inside and using all of my might, i grabbed my refrigerator, picked it up, and threw it over the rail and on top of the guy, crushing and killing him!! but all of the strain and exertion from picking up the refrigerator gave me a heart attack and i died.”  saint peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let the poor soul in.   another man came walking up to the pearly gates, and saint peter told this man the same thing—that in order to get in, he was going to have to make saint peter laugh. so the second started to tell saint peter how he died.   “oh man, it was awful! i was doing aerobics out on my 26th story balcony of my apartment, when all of a sudden a flock of birds came out of nowhere and started attacking me! i was trying to get away, but i fell over the edge of my railing! however, on my way down i managed to grab the railing of the apartment below mine...but then this maniac suddenly showed up and started smashing my hands and fingers with a hammer until i let go! fortunately for me, i landed in some bushes, but then some guy dropped a freaking refrigerator on me!  saint peter chuckled again, let the second guy into heaven, and was realizing he has found a way he could really start enjoying his job! about that time, a 3rd man comes walking up to the pearly gates, and saint peter gave him the speech about needing to make him laugh, and asks him how he died.  “oh man, you’re never going to believe this shit! alright, so picture this—i’m butt naked and hiding in a refrigerator...”	3

two boys in egypt free a crocodile...  in a small village in egypt lived two orphan boys, set and amenhotep. they always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.     one day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. the two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.     once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! “thank you, young men” said the fairy, “your hearts are truly selfless, and i will grant each of you one wish. what are your names?”     “this is my friend set, and you can call me ‘ep’”, said amenhotep.     “very well, ep” said the fairy “what is the desire of your heart?”     “i wish i was the strongest man in the world!” amenhotep wished.     “very well”, said the fairy, “but you must always use your strength to help others.” smoke gathered around amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles.     the fairy turned to set “and what is your wish, set?”   set responded “i never want to be poor again! i wish for money!”     “very well,” said the fairy. smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. “greetings, sirs! my name is elmon, and i am here to serve!”     “elmon is an expert in all things money,” said the fairy, “he will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.”     amenhotep and set were inseparable. true to his word, amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive amenhotep earned him the nickname “imp”. with elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.     years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, josep.     ep and set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. set built a campus in cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. over the years, set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business.     as all fathers do, amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. he sent josep to the the hq in cairo to learn business from set. once there, josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of elmon, the elf.     josep spent months at hq learning how to run the business. while there, set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. he sent josep with the proposal to elmon to determine the financial logistics.     upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on set’s fellow man, elmon keeled over and died, instantly.     josep was shocked, and ran to alert set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. in a rage, he accused josep of killing elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.     amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.     without the financial and legal savvy of elmon, set’s case was a mess. amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. “come, imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.”     set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame josep for elmon’s murder.     the case was brought before the court, but set’s claims were weak and unsupported. the judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.     obviously, ep’s teen didn’t kill imp’s elf.	3

an anthropologist visits a local translator in zimbabwe. "i'd like to set up a meeting with the nearby xhosa tribe," he says. "but i haven't had any luck finding them. can you help me send a message?"  the translator smiles. "ah yes, it is difficult to find them. this particular tribe has little interest in westerners. but they will still meet with you. all you need to do is head to  a specific plateau, and wait there after saying this phrase." he uttered a series of xhosa syllables and clicking sounds. the anthropologist took careful note of the phrase and thanked him.   on his way, he became slightly lost but eventually came upon a plateau fitting the description. he stood on the edge and proceeded to make the clicking sounds. a few moments later, a woman from the tribe arrived. he smiled and began to introduce himself, but the woman suddenly started flirting and rubbing herself all over him.   unsure what to do next, the anthropologist froze, but a few moments later, the translator appeared and shooed her away.  "this is the wrong plateau, my friend," he laughed. "this is a meeting place for prostitutes!"  "oh, i'm terribly sorry...." the anthropologist began.   "it's perfectly fine, my friend. just be more careful what you click on, you could have gotten a virus!"	3

"so my first wish was: i want so much money, that i must throw it away, because i don't know where to put it. and i got it."

effects of shaving my ass hair don't shave that hair!!! i have recently made a mistake in my life, and i offer my story to you, that you may learn from my error. it all started, as many things do, with me having trouble shitting.  no, i was not constipated; this was not a regularity problem but a matter of technique. it seems my ass-hair had grown to such a length that tiny grogans were constantly getting tied up in the matted jungle between my asscheeks. it led to much frustration, with me knowing that i still had something to drop, but unable to shake the tenacious turd loose from its butthair dwelling. eventually i would have to do two things: either reach down with some paper and try to pinch off the lingering loaf (which required careful precision to avoid smearing the creature all over my rear, especially since i had no way of seeing what i was doing) or just go for broke, start wiping, and hope that i could remove all the leftover fecal matter before the toilet paper reached its can't-be-flushed threshold.  i was contemplating this problem, when i had what seemed at the time to be a bright idea. "hey! this is my butt and my butt-hair, right? so why don't i just eliminate all the hair, and then my grogans will flow out like beer from a keg!" i said to myself. it is a statement that will go down in history with a lot of other regretted statements. "how many indians could there be?" said by general custer. "looks like a good day for a drive!" by jfk. "there! america on-line now has complete usenet access!" by some idiot system tech. such was my anal shaving idea.  i performed the operation that night, with a cheap disposable razor and a towel to sit on. starting from the bottom, and shaving from the crack to the cheeks, i began the arduous process of ridding my ass of hair. occassionally, i would have to clean the razor of accumulated hair and miscellaneous slime, which i did by wiping it on the towel. slowly, my twin mounds and the between-ravine began to resemble the hairless cheeks of a newborn baby. finally, i wiped the razor one last time, and surveyed my work. the towel was covered with a pile of hair. my ass was smooth as ivory. i smiled, satisfied, thinking my troubles were over.  little did i know.  i now have a great respect for anal-hair. like everything in this world god created, it has its mighty purpose in existence. it was only after i had removed it that i started to learn how much i had been taking it for granted. for one, it provides friction. i learned this the next day, when i walked out into the sun heading for class. after climbing two flights of stairs and starting to sweat, i started to notice something unpleasant. the sweat was accumulating in my crack, and was causing the unpleasant sensation of my two asscheeks sliding past each other with every step. i thought about going to the bathroom and wiping it off, but had to get to class. eventually, i thought, it would dry.  unfortunately, it did dry, but only after mingling with the microscopic shit- molecules lingering around my brown starfish. when i stood up after class, my cheeks were stuck together with a slimy sticky shit/sweat combination. as i made my way back to my dorm, it started to itch. god-damn, did it itch! felt like a swarm of ants was making its way up and down my crack. fighting to keep from jamming my hand down there and scratching away, i rushed back to the dorm.  unfortunately again, this exertion caused me to sweat, and when i finally reached my room, my cheeks were sliding back and forth against each other like a pair of horny cane-toads. i quickly dropped my pants, and attempted to dry my ass off by sticking it in front of a fan and spreading my cheeks. as i pulled the two mounds of flesh apart, a horrible stench burst free and filled the room. every dog within a 4 block radius started to howl. i had it worst of all, as the ripe aroma of festering shit/sweat went into the fan and blew back into my face. i fought to keep from heaving. and as i sat there, fighting vomit, my ass cheeks spread and dripping, with the concentrated aroma of my body odor mixed with the tangy smell of my own shit blowing right into my face, i had only one thought: "it will be like this until the hair grows back. weeks."  later on, trying to deal as best i could, wiping my ass at every opportunity, i discovered another wonderful use for ass-hair - ventilation. i attempted to launch a fart, only to have it get stuck between my asscheeks. apparently, with no hair, the two pink twins can get vacuum sealed together, and the result was a frustrating fart that slid up and down between my cheeks like a lost gerbil.  as if that wasn't enough, i am now enduring further torture. as anyone who has ever shaved anything knows, when hair is first growing in, it comes in as stubble. imagine your ass having the texture of a brillo pad. well, that is what i am dealing with now. it is a hellish torture, and there are many times when i just look out the window and contemplate why i shouldn't just jump out and get it all over with in one fleshy splat, rather than endure this constant agony.  friends, don't shave your ass-hair!	2
a man who had three beautiful girlfriends  a man had three beautiful girlfriends but didn't know which one to marry. as a test, he decided to give each woman $5,000 to see how they would spend it.   the first girlfriend went out and got herself a complete makeover. she told him, "i spent the money so i could look pretty for you cause i love you so much."   the second went shopping and bought the man new golf clubs, an ipad and 80-inch flatscreen television. she said, "i bought these gifts for you because i love you so much."   the third woman took the $5,000 and invested it in stock market, to the man and reinvested the rest. she said, "i am investing the rest of the money for our future because i love you so much."   the man thought long and hard about how each of his girlfriends had spent the money, and then he decided to marry the one with the biggest tits.	2

the traffic stop  a man is pulled over by a police officer.    the policeman approaches the driver's door. "is there a problem, officer?"  the officer says, "sir, you were speeding. can i see your license please?"  the driver responds, "i'd give it to you, but i don't have one."  "you don't have one?"  the man responds, "i lost it four times for drunk driving."  the officer is shocked. "i see. can i see your vehicle registration papers please?"  "i'm sorry, i can't do that."  the officer says, "why not?"  "i stole this car."  the officer says, "stole it?"  the man says, "yes, and i killed the owner."  at this point the officer is getting irate. "you what?!"  "she's in the trunk if you want to see."  the officer looks at the man and slowly backs away to his own car and calls for back up. within minutes, five police cars show up, surrounding the car. a senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half-drawn gun.  the senior officer says, "sir, could you step out of your vehicle please?"  the man steps out of his vehicle. "is there a problem, sir?"  "one of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner."  "murdered the owner?"  the officer responds, "yes, could you please open the trunk of your car please?"  the man opens the trunk, but there is nothing there.  the officer says, "is this your car, sir?"  the man says, "yes," and hands over the registration papers.  the officer, understandably, is quite stunned.  "one of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license."  the man digs through his pockets, pulls out a wallet and hands it to the officer. the officer opens the wallet and examines the license. he looks quite puzzled.  "thank you, sir. one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, stole this car, and murdered the owner."  the man replies, "i bet you the lying bastard told you i was speeding, too!"	2

no sex tonight! i've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.  and i never have figured out the whole venus and mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.  for example… one evening last week, my wife and i were getting into bed.  well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said "i don't feel like it, i just want you to hold me."  i said "what??!! what was that?!"  so she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear..."you're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man."  she responded to my puzzled look by saying, "can't you just love me for who i am and not what i do for you in the bedroom?"  realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, i went to sleep.  the very next day, i opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. we went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. i walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. she couldn't decide which one to take so i told her we'd just buy them all. she wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so i said lets get a pair for each outfit. we went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.  let me tell you...she was so excited. she must have thought i was one wave short of a tsunami. i started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. but, i think i threw her for a loop when i said, "that's fine, honey."  she appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, "i think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier."  i could hardly contain myself when i blurted out, "no honey, i don't feel like it."  her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, "what?"  i then said "honey, i just want you to hold this stuff for a while.  you're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman."  and just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, i added, "why can't you just love me for who i am and not for the things i buy you?"  apparently, no sex tonight either!	3

an east end gang boss had always been very careful with whom he employed, for fear of being grassed up... he thought he'd been really clever in hiring a crooked accountant who was deaf and dumb. there wasn't much of a risk that he would overhear too much. however, it quickly dawned on the boss that someone was stealing money from him. a lot of money. and it didn't take long for him to discover it was his crooked accountant.  "benny", he ordered one of his henchmen, "get that cunt down 'ere, pronto - and get marty to come with him. he understands sign language".   later in his office, the boss started interrogating him.  "marty, ask him what he's done with the money."  at first the terrified accountant signalled his ignorance of the theft but when a gun was put to his head, he spilled the beans. with rapid hand movements, he explained that he'd hidden all the money in a trunk in an old derelict factory, two miles from the office.  "so what did he say?" demanded the boss, impatiently.  "it's no good, boss," replied marty. "he says you haven't got the bottle to shoot him, so you can go and get fucked".	3

"it's about time you contributed to this family, dave."  dave rolled his eyes and muttered something under his breath to her. he turned to the genie and said, "i wish for 100 million dollars!" the genie snapped his fingers and suddenly a massive mound of cash appeared... but cathy's mound was twice as big and she said, "dave you idiot, why not wish for a billion dollars or a trillion dollars. i should have known you'd screw this up."  again, dave rolled his eyes and muttered something under his breath. "for my second wish, i want to be the most powerful man in the world!" the genie snapped his fingers and said, done, but now cathy is twice as powerful as you."  cathy snickered and said, "well the halfwit got one right. i'll straighten you out yet."  dave again rolled his eyes and started cursing under his breath... then a smile came across his face.

irish cow joke there is an old dirt farm family who have nothing of value in this world but their milk cow. now this was z good milk cow, which gave good high quality milk which they were able to sell and get along, so the family was actually very content. well one day the father gets up early to milk the cow, as was his routine and found the cow dead in the field. well, the father gets distraught as he now knows the family is ruined so in his grief, he hangs himself in the barn. soon after, the mother gets up and goes out to bring her husband some breakfast in the field, finds the the cow dead, then goes into the barn and sees her husband hanged. now she is completely beside herself, so she goes down to the creek and drowns.   well a little while later, the eldest son comes out, sees the cow dead in the field, dad dead in the barn,  mom dead in the creek, and a fae sitting on a rock. quite taken 'aback, at the events he isn't that surprised when the fae speaks.  "you look like you're having a bad day." she says.  "i should say." he responds  "well, i may be able to help. if you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, i'll restore all you've lost." she says.  now a fae bargain in not to be taken likely but he considers it being not much more than twenty and quite verial, he decides to take her up on it. true to her word they go at it, but he just isn't able to get there, so she kills him for the disappointment.   soon after the second son comes down after seeing the cow, the dad in the barn, mother and brother in the creek, and the fae on the rocks.  "you look like you're having a bad day." she says.  "i am." he says.  again she tell of her ability to help saying "if you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, i'll restore all you've lost."   well he doesn't even think twice thinking that he is just 18 and quite ready. so they go at it but just as he starts the last time, he get a cramp and collapses in exhaustion. dissatisfied she kills him dead for waiting her time.  finally the 16 year old son comes on down. the cow dead in the field. dad dead in the barn, mom and two brothers dead in the creek and the fae combing her hair on the rocks.   once again she greets him with "you look like you're having a bad day."   "i am." he says sadly  again she tell of her ability to help saying "if you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, i'll restore all you've lost."   unexpectedly, he asks, "fine, but what if i make love to you fifteen times?"  "fifteen times!" the fae snorts, "well, if you can do that, i'll restore all that you've lost and give you a mansion right where your hovel stands."  "aye grand, but let me ask you, what if i do it twenty times?" he asked after a thought.  "twenty times?" the fae snickered. "faith, i do all that from before and i'll give you a big crock of gold that never empties."   the young man thinks for another second then straightens up and says. "alright, we can start in a moment, but let me ask you this one last thing. if i make love to you twenty times, whats to stop you from dying before we finish? i mean the cow did."	1

one night at a local bar frequented by a bunch of deer hunters who were waiting for the opening day of deer season, the local sheriff scoped out the joint for possible drunk drivers. as he waited, eventually a patron stumbled out of the bar, fumbled for his keys, tried them in three different cars until he finally found his, got inside and rested his head on the steering wheel. the deputy knew he had his drunk driver, so now all he had to do was wait for him to start his engine and pull out of the lot.  a few hours passed by and most of the other deer hunters had left by then, when the patron abruptly lifted his head, cranked the car up and drove out of the lot like a bat out of hell. the deputy followed him and stopped him promptly. he administered the breath-o-lizer test and it read 0.00.  confused, the deputy asked the driver what the hell was going on. the driver looked at him innocently and said, "well, tonight i'm the designated decoy."	2

a man has been drinking alone all day at a bar and checks his clock "1:30am, fuck. i need to go home now or my wife's going to rip my balls off", thinks to himself. but as he's trying to get up, he falls awkwardly to the floor.  "i'm just way too drunk right now, i need to sober up."  so he asks the barman for a coffee, he drinks it up and 30 minutes later he tries to stand up, but again, falling to the floor, this time, even harder.  at this point he realizes he needs to get home no matter what, so he starts crawling towards his house. after 40 minutes he gets there, lays down next to his (asleep) wife and passes out.  the next morning his wife wakes him up and starts shouting at him, "so... how was last night, huh? was it fun drinking all day?"  the man is 100% sure his wife was asleep when he got home so he tries to play it cool, "not really, just hanging with some coworkers... we didn't drink much... just a couple of beers."  the woman starts nodding sarcastically and responds, "the bar owner called this morning, your wheelchair's there, you dumbfuck."	3

bored at work so i wrote my first joke. it’s extremely dumb but maybe it’ll make someone laugh. an extremely wealthy family owned countless successful companies, bought out competitors and even purchased new ventures if they looked promising enough. nothing was too big or small, and nothing was off limits.  the family consisted of a mother (linda), father (robert) and 3 sons (robert jr., louis & clarence). robert jr. and louis were in their late twenties and intelligent beyond their years. they were primed to lead the family when the time came. clarence wasn’t as smart or successful as his older brothers, but he strived to prove everyone wrong. he wanted to help lead this family into the future alongside his brothers.  linda and robert tasked the three brothers with purchasing three more companies to put under the family umbrella. they each had a budget of $50 million and set out on their own paths to make their parents proud. they were given 7 days to acquire their respective businesses.  clarence ran out of the room as fast as he could, jumped in his porsche and took off. he already had a place in mind. he heard about a massive new waste disposal company that just moved into town last year. they were known for their environmentally friendly practices and the company was already  profitable. it was perfect.  after 7 days, a family meeting was held where each of the brothers were to present and introduce their newest acquisitions. robert jr. insisted he go first. he proudly stated, “mother, father, i’ve taken an up-and-coming lumber yard, as you can see on my chest. it’s called alpha lumber.” he points to his left chest and shows off his new polo shirt with the alpha lumber logo beautifully showcased. louis insisted he presented next, “nicely done, brother,” he says, “but it’s not as promising as mine. mother, father, i’ve taken a software and technology company, as you can see on my chest. it’s called gigabite and is projected to rival microsoft within the decade.” he points to his own chest, revealing the new gigabite logo.  clarence, eager to prove himself nearly cut his brother off so he could take the floor. he began,    “mother, father, i’ve taken a massive dump, as you can see on my chest...”	3

so, once upon a time...... a horse sees a rock band perform and thinks "hey, i could do that." the  horse calls up his local music store and is like "i wanna learn guitar, just one problem, i'm a horse." the employee says "don't worry we can do  that." the horse goes, learns guitar for a few months, gets really good,  and is pretty happy with himself. "ok, now i can start a band!"  so he calls up his friend, a cow and says "hey, i'm pretty excited bout  this band i'm starting, do you wanna be my bass player?" of course!"  the cow replies. so the cow calls up the music store and says " i wanna  learn bass, just one problem, i'm a cow." "we can do that" replies the  employee. so the cow learns and starts playing with his buddy.  soon, their friend the sheep gets jealous. he asks, "hey, can i be in the  band?" "sure, we could use a drummer," replies the horse. so the sheep  calls up the music store and says " i wanna learn the drums, just one  problem, i'm a sheep." "we can definitely do that!," says the employee.  so the sheep learns drums and the three friends are officially a band.  they work hard, and eventually they write a few songs and make a demo.  a producer reaches out and says he can make them famous. so the band  writes an album and goes on tour. at one stop on their tour, the horse  gets a call about a family emergency. he explains this to his band-mates  and they tell him to go home. he goes back and the emergency is not that serious. he decides to meet his band-mates at the next stop on the  tour. the sheep and cow take a plane while the horse takes a train. the  plane crashes tragically into the side of a mountain. the horse hears  this and is absolutely devastated. "i've lost my best friends, my  band-mates, my whole life," he cries. he decides to drink his life away  and throw it all away.  &#x200b;  so the horse walks into a bar, and the bartender  say, "why the long face?"	2

a man walked into a bar on the 100th floor of a building, chugged a pint, then jumped out of an open window. ten minutes later, with no injuries, he ran back into the bar, chugged a pint, then jumped out of the same window.  when he returned ten minutes later, a man asked him how he survived.  “you see, alcohol makes you warmer and heat rises. so if you chug a pint really quickly then concentrate really hard as you fall, you temporarily float just before you hit the ground.”  the man was so amazed that he too chugged a pint even faster than the other man, then jumped out of the window. he fell and fell and fell... and then landed on the ground with a splat. he died instantly.  the bartender then turned to the man in the bar and said, “you’re such a dick when you’re drunk, superman.”	3

court ruling from the uk a seven year old boy was at the centre of a courtroom drama yesterday when he challenged a court ruling over who should’ve custody of him. the boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with the child custody law and regulations requiring that family unity be maintained to the degree possible. the boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her.when the judge suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried out that they also beat him. after considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the  boy to propose who should’ve custody of him. after two recesses to check legal references and confer with child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the england football team, whom the boy firmly believes aren’t capable of beating anyone.	1
