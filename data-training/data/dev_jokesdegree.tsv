1	A rich, but cheap father was putting together a birthday celebration for his daughter. A wealthy, but stingy father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 18 y/o daughter.  He wanted the party to be extravagant, but wanted to spend as little money as possible. He had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.  "Why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *My daughter is inviting all of her friends, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake*, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.  *How quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "Hello," the father asked, "I would like to buy a cake."  "Of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  The father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  The day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. All of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  The monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "Why do you do this for free? You should take money for your services!"  The monk smiled and said, "I do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."  PART 2 and PART 3 in my profile
2	The Navajo man and NASA When NASA was preparing for the Apollo Project, it took the astronauts to the Arizona desert for training.  One day, a Navajo elder and his son came across the space crew walking among the rocks. The elder, who spoke only Navajo, asked a question. His son translated for the NASA people: "What are these guys in the big suits doing?"  One of the astronauts said that they were practicing for a trip to the moon. When his son relayed this comment the Navajo elder got all excited and asked if it would be possible to give to the astronauts a message to deliver to the moon.  Recognizing a promotional opportunity when he saw one, a NASA official accompanying the astronauts said, "Why certainly!" and told an underling to get a tape recorder. The Navajo elder's comments into the microphone were brief.  The NASA official asked the son if he would translate what his father had said. The son listened to the recording and laughed uproariously. But he refused to translate. So the NASA people took the tape to a nearby Navajo village and played it for other members of the tribe. They too laughed long and loudly but also refused to translate the elder's message to the moon.  Finally, an official government translator was summoned. After he finally stopped laughing the translator relayed the message: "Watch out for these guys - they have come to steal your land."

Trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this."    The Devil smiled and said, "Monica, you're free to go!”

1	A man on a business trip in Spain decides to go to a bull fight. After the event, he stops in to the little restaurant next to the venue called "The Matador". As he checks out the menu trying to decide what he wants, he sees a waiter bring a dish to another customer.  The other customer starts eating what appear to be two large meatballs with great gusto. When the waiter comes to his table, the man asks about the dish. "Oh Senor, that is the Matador Special," replies the waiter in broken English, "Our very best dish! Fresh vegetables, beans and zee cojones from zee bull. We get the cojones immediately after the bull fight. Exquisito!"  "Okay, that's what I'll have," says the businessman.  "But I am very sorry Senor, but that dish is only available once per day."  Disappointed, the man chooses another dish and plans to order the Matador Special the next day.  The next day the man goes to the bull fight again, and afterwards stops into the restaurant. Just as the waiter is coming to his table, he sees another waiter bringing the Matador Special to a customer who got there before him. "Damn!" he says to himself. "And tomorrow's my last day here."  So the next day, he skips the bull fight, and arrives at the restaurant early. He is the first one seated, and proudly proclaims, "I'll have the Matador Special!"  "An excellent choice, Senor!" responds the waiter. Soon afterwards, the waiter brings out his dish, but the meat balls are disappointingly small, and taste rather foul.  "What's with this," the now angry man shouts, "I thought this was your premier dish!"  "I'm very sorry, Senor," said the waiter, "But you see, sometimes zee bull, he wins."

2	The madam opened the brothel door in Elko County, Nevada, and saw a rather dignified, well-dressed, good-looking man in his late forties or early fifties. “May I help you, sir?" she asked.  "I want to see Valerie," the man replied.  "Sir, Valerie is one of our most expensive ladies. Perhaps you would prefer someone else," said the madam.  "No, I must see Valerie," he replied.  Just then, Valerie appeared and announced to the man she charged $10,000 a visit.  Without hesitation, the man pulled out ten thousand dollars and gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs. After an hour, the man calmly left.  The next night, the man appeared again, once more demanding to see Valerie.  Valerie explained that no one had ever come back two nights in a row as she was so very expensive. There were no discounts and the price was still $10,000. The gentleman did not blink an eye. Again, he pulled out a wad of cash, gave it to Valerie, and they went upstairs. After an hour, he left.  The following night the man was there yet again. Everyone was astounded that he had come for a third consecutive night, maybe a record in the history of brothels in Nevada, which date back into the early 1800s. But without hesitation he paid Valerie the ten grand and off they went upstairs.  After their session, Valerie said to the man, "No one has ever been with me three nights in a row. Where are you from?"  The man replied, "Billings, Montana."  "Really," she said. "I have family in Billings."  "I know," the man said. "I regret to tell you, but your sister died, and I am her attorney. She asked me to give you your $30,000 inheritance."  The moral of the story is that three things in life are certain:  1. Death  2. Taxes  3. Being screwed by a lawyer

1	An old fisherman suspected his wife of cheating, so he hired a private investigator... This is a long one, so bear with me.   The fisherman and his wife lived in Saint John’s, Newfoundland and he made his living by going out into the ocean to net cod under the watchful eye of his captain.    In those days, the best fishing was to be found far out on the banks very far from the shore, so the fisherman was often away from home for weeks at a time. Since he was away so much, the marriage had suffered and he saw in the way his wife acted that she must be unfaithful. He would’ve suspected the captain as his wife’s lover, for he had always had eyes for his lady. However, this was not possible, as they were together on the modest fishing boat. The same went for the helmsman and the first mate. Still, he remembered his wife’s distant demeanour and knew that she must be seeking comfort in the arms of another.    Now, the fisherman’s father had been a mean old drunken fool, but also a very fine whaler in the dying days of that storied profession. Before he died, he left his son with a valuable lesson: to conquer the swiftest and most clever of whales, you need not be swifter nor cleverer; only more persistent than he. These words echoed in the man’s mind the day that he called up a private investigator.      The retired detective was a mainlander, and had a high fee. The fisherman figured it was worth it though, and slipped the money to him over the counter of a run-down pub one day as they discussed the details of the case. The fisherman was only in port for a short while at a time though (‘no wonder he has marriage troubles,’ thought the detective) so he soon left his wife, the detective, and the home-wrecker behind  in Saint John’s.  Two weeks later, the fisherman returned and was disappointed to hear from the detective that there were no leads in the case as they sipped whiskey at the pub. Nevertheless he paid the man again before heading out onto the sea once more.    You can probably guess that this continued for a while, with the detective finding nothing the second time around. But the old sea dog remembered his father’s wise words and paid the investigator again.  But then, weeks later on a chilly September morning, the fisherman spied the private investigator waving to him from the end of a pier as the cod-laden boat pulled in to port.    “Come quick!” hollered the detective, “not only have I confirmed that your wife has taken a lover, her and the bastard are at your house right now!”    So the two men sped off towards the fisherman’s house, and sure enough, as they peeked through the living room window his wife and lover were there, doing things that we don’t mention in polite company.    “I’ll be damned,” said the fisherman. “I was right all along. I guess it was worth paying your fee all this time. What do you say we head down to the pub? I’d like to buy you a beer or two!”    “But what about the man who’s been sleeping with your wife?” asked the private investigator, shocked at the man’s nonchalance.   “Oh, that rotten bastard?” replied the fisherman. “He can buy his own damn beer!”

1	There was a man who believed that he could cook the best meal ever existed in the history of kitchen culture, and he wanted to show his dish to the most talented an known chefs from all around the world He invited all the top chefs of the world that he could reach to and organized a nice evening where he would cook and serve his special course.

5	My late Grandfathers favorite joke There was an American wrestler from Texas named John, who throughout his high school career had never lost a match. As he went on into college he continued undefeated. He became a national icon and symbol of American strength.  News began to circulate of a Russian wrestler who was fierce and unstoppable. As each wrestlers legends grew, a match was set up between the two, America versus Russia. The match would be held in Texas.  John began training immediately. Every day his coach would tell him, “This Russian has a move called the Mongolian Death Grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian Death Grip. DO NOT let him get you in the Mongolian Death Grip”  The day of the match finally came. Just before each wrestler stepped onto the mat in front of the capacity crowd, the coach once again said, “Whatever you do, do not let him get you in the Mongolian death grip. No one has ever escaped the Mongolian death grip”.   Four seconds into the match, the Russian had the American in the Mongolian death grip. The coach buried his face into his hands and cursed John for not listening to his advice. All of the sudden he heard the crowd irrupt in a chant of USA USA USA. He looked up and saw the Russian pinned by John. The coach ran out to meet John and embarrassingly told him, “I didn’t see... Once he had you in the Mongolian Death Grip I looked away. How in the world did you get out of the Mongolian death grip?”  With heavy breath, John told him “Well coach, that Russian grabbed me and twisted my body in ways I never imagined possible. I was wincing in pain when I open my eyes and right in front of me were two testicles. So I bit them.”  “What???” Said the coach... “John I don’t think that is legal. You could be disqualified”  “I don’t know about that coach. But I can tell you one thing. You ain’t got no idea how strong you are until you bite your own balls”  (Today is the anniversary of my Grandfather’s passing, and I posted this because he has been on my mind since I woke up. I just saw the response that this has garnered and I am fuckin crying. Thank you all so much. You have made this day so much better)

"Yes," the man calmly says. "I have the loot in the back."     The cop begins to get angry. "Sir, I'm afraid you have to come with me." The cop reaches in the window to subdue the man.

However, we found none of these things in your car."     The man replies, "Yeah, and I bet that liar said I was speeding too!"

They float on a raft until they hit an island where they’re met by a tribe of fierce locals who despise outsiders. A member of tribe offers to translate for them so the chief can decide their fate.   The men are brought before a large clearing at the edge of the village where the chief begins his sentencing. “In the field behind me our ancestors have grown all the fruit known to man. You are you to walk the field and pick your favorite fruit then return it to me”   The men think wow this is a very simple punishment. “We shall gather the fruits of our native states to show the chief we miss home and just want to go back” says the man from Hawaii. The other two agree and all three set off into the field. Around 5 minutes later the man from Georgia appeared from the field and approached the chief holding a peach. “Chief I bring to you my native fruit. A gesture that I simply wish to return home” The chief with a smile tells the man to insert the fruit into his rectum and he will be given a canoe and allowed to leave. If he fails to insert the fruit he will be beheaded on the spot.  Instantly the man stuffs the peach into his rectum just before the man from Florida returns holding an orange. As the Florida man approaches he tells the chief “I have brought you the fruit from my native home simply to show you I miss home and would love to go back”. Again the chief explains the process and the man begins to hastily stuff the orange in his rectum.   As he gets his pants down and puts the orange in his rectum he begins to laugh. Soon after the first man begins to laugh hysterically as well. Within 30 seconds both men are in tears from laughter. The chief asks the translator what these men are laughing at to which the translator says  “They said the man from Hawaii is looking for the pineapples”

Since you and the rest of the class understood my intent perfectly well, and the word "may" to show permission is rapidly falling out of fashion, there is nothing wrong with asking you whether I can borrow a pencil.  **Teacher:** Possibly so, in colloquial speech. Discerning context can help us decipher the nuance of each sentence on a case-by-case basis. However, as your teacher, my task is to teach you the intricacies and nuances of the English language with rigor, so that you may have a greater mastery of the language in order to effectively and precisely control what you want to communicate. In this case, the difference between the words "can" and "may".  **Student:** Point taken. May I borrow a pencil?  **Teacher:** No, you may not. The state cut funding for education again.

1	Be wary of a Florida senior with a gun. An elderly Florida lady did her shopping and, upon returning to her car, found four males in the act of leaving with her vehicle.  She dropped her shopping bags and drew her handgun, proceeding to scream at the top of her lungs, “I have a gun, and I know how to use it! Get out of the car!”. The four men didn't wait for a second threat. They got out and ran like mad.  The lady, somewhat shaken, then proceeded to load her shopping bags into the back of the car and got into the driver’s seat. She was so shaken that she could not get her key into the ignition.  She tried and tried, and then she realized why. It was for the same reason she had wondered why there was a football, a Frisbee and two 12-packs of beer in the front seat. A few minutes later, she found her own car parked four or five spaces farther down.  She loaded her bags into the car and drove to the police station to report her mistake.  The sergeant to whom she told the story couldn't stop laughing. He pointed to the other end of the counter, where four pale men were reporting a car jacking by a mad, elderly woman described as white, less than five feet tall, glasses, curly white hair, and carrying a large handgun.  No charges were filed.

"I give it to them," replies the lawyer, "and then I send them a bill." The doctor is shocked, but agrees to give it a try. The next day, still feeling slightly guilty, the doctor prepares the bills. When he goes to place them in his mailbox, he finds a bill from the lawyer.

1	Customer satisfaction Don't think I've seen this posted here so here goes  A company executive decided to have lunch at this restaurant with rave reviews. He sat down at a table and noticed that every waiter had a spoon in their shirt pocket. He called a waiter over to ask him about this.  'I noticed something peculiar... Why does every waiter have a spoon in their pocket?"  'Neat observation sir! Our restaurant's goal is to maximise customer satisfaction. A study showed that most of our patrons drop utensils quite frequently, and the spoon gets dropped more often than the fork. Our spare utensils are kept in the kitchen. Rather than going all the way and spending more time than needed, our management came up with this idea. By keeping a spoon in our pocket, our waiters can instantly hand the patron a new one, maximising our productivity and customer satisfaction at the same time! A study before and after this showed a MASSIVE increase in customer satisfaction."  The executive was impressed. "Oh... That's very good! Another thing I noticed was this. Everyone seems to have a cord sown onto the front of their pants. What is that for?"  "Wow sir! You are sharp eyed indeed! This was another initiative by Management. When we urinate, we wash our hands after we're done to stay hygienic. Now, washing hands takes at least 20 seconds, valuable time we could spend helping the patrons out. These cords are meant for supporting our penises, and once we're done, to lift them and drop them back into our pants. Our hands stay clean, and we don't waste any time at all!"  The bemused executive had one more query.  "I am very impressed by your restaurant! One last thing... Why don't you have the cord on your pant?"  The waiter broke out into a smile. "Your observation skills are extraordinary sir!"  He lowered his voice and leaned in.  "Between you and me sir...  I use the spoon."

3	Biker joke While riding my Harley, I swerved to avoid hitting a deer, lost control, and landed in a ditch, severely banging my head.  Dazed and confused, I crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiny new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman behind the wheel who asked, "Are you okay?"  As I looked up, I noticed she was wearing a low-cut blouse with cleavage to die for...  "I'm okay, I think," I replied as I pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.  She said, "Get in and I'll take you home, so I can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head."  "That's nice of you," I answered, "but I don't think my wife will like me doing that..."  "Oh, come now, I'm a nurse," she insisted. "I need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly."  Well, she was really pretty and very persuasive. Being sort of shaken and weak, I agreed, but repeated, "I'm sure my wife won't like this..."  We arrived at her place which was just few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, I thanked her and said, "I feel a lot better, but I know my wife is going to be really upset so I'd better go now."  "Don't be silly!" she said with a smile. "Stay for a while. She won't know anything. By the way, where is she?"  "Still in the ditch, I guess."

He’s been sneakily checking her out ever since he arrived, but doesn’t have the courage to start talking to her.    Suddenly she sneezes, and her glass eye comes flying out of its socket toward the man. His reflexes kick in and he reaches out, plucks it out of the air, and hands it back to her.  The redhead is mortified. “Oh my, I am so sorry,” she says as she pops her eye back into place. “Let me buy your dinner to make it up to you.”  So he joins her table and they enjoy a wonderful meal together. Afterwards, they go to the theatre followed by drinks at a bar. They talk, they laugh, she shares her deepest dreams and he shares his. She listens.  After paying for everything, she asks him if he would like to come to her place for a nightcap. He says yes and they return to her place.  He ends up staying the night. The next morning, she cooks a gourmet meal with all the trimmings. The guy is amazed at how everything has been so perfect and how incredible this woman is. He can’t believe his luck. “You know,” he said, “you are the perfect woman, are you this nice to every guy you meet?”  “No,” she replies, “You just happened to catch my eye.”

3	A priest, an alcoholic, and an engineer are sentenced to death. They are to be killed by the guillotine.  First is the priest. The executioner says "You can go on the guillotine either face up or face down". The priest says "I want to die face up, looking up to the heavens". So the priest lies face up. The executioner releases the blade; the blade falls rapidly but suddenly stops just 1 inch from the priest's neck. Given the miracle, the priest is allowed to walk free.  Next comes the alcoholic. The executioner offers him the same choice, "Do you want to lie facing up or facing down?". The alcoholic says "I want to face up... to remember my glorious drinking days". So the alcoholic lies face up. The executioner releases the blade, and again, it suddenly stops just 1 inch from the man's neck. Given the miracle, the alcoholic is allowed to walk free.  Finally, it's the engineer's turn.  Once again, the executioner offers him the same choice, "Face up or face down?". The engineer scratches his head and says "face up I guess". So the engineer lies face up. Just as the executioner is about to release the blade, the engineer starts shouting. "WAIT WAIT!! .... I found the problem!".

The warden saw that deep down, Andy was a good person and made arrangements for Andy to learn a trade while doing his time.   After three years, Andy was recognized as one of the best carpenters in the local area.  Often he would be given a weekend pass to do odd jobs for the citizens of the community and he always reported back to prison before Sunday night was over.

But, alas, Andy refused.  He told the warden, "Gosh, I'd really like to help you but counter fitting is what got me into prison in the first place."

The priest starts feeling bad about how harshly he responded to the drunk, so he apologizes and asks, "so how long have you been suffering from arthritis?". The drunk says, "Oh, I don't have it.

Now stay stay with me on this. I’m going to put honey on the tip of my dick to lure the bee out.” The man and women are visibly concerned but agree to the procedure.

The man, puts his hand into his pocket and pulls out 5 dollars and 98 cents in exact change.  “How much will it cost to buy everyone here a round of drinks?”, the man asks, taking a sip of his drink.  “That would cost 257.54$, sir.”, the bartender says, looking at the register.  “Let  everyone have a round of drinks on me.”, the man replied, pulling out  exactly 257 dollars and 54 cents out of his pocket. “And while you’re at  it, get a bowl of water for my donkey and ostrich.”  Everyone in the bar is cheering as they get a free drink.  Looking at their reaction, the man goes “Eh, fuck it. What is the total tab of all these people in the bar?”  “3325.79$, sir.”, the bartender asks after adding up all active tabs in the bar.  The  man puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out a huge stack of bills and  some coins and hands it over without even counting them.  After counting it, the bartender finds that the man handed over exactly 3325.79$.  Now  curious, he asks the man “How is it that you are able to pull out the  exact amount of money needed every time? Are you some magician?”  “I’ll tell you if you can keep it a secret.” the stranger replies.  “Of course”, the bartender says.  “Well,  this happened around a year ago, I was walking by the street next to my  house and tripped over something. I looked back to see what had nearly  made me fall and saw that it was a lamp, all shiny and golden.”  “Suddenly, a puff of smoke clouded my vision, when I could see again, there was a genie there!”  “He said ‘Now that you have made me free  I shall grant you wishes three.’ Now, the most important thing in the  world right now is money, and I thought to just ask for a large sum of  money. I thought about it a little, I realised  that just asking for a large sum of money straight up is kind of  stupid, it would be hard to manage and it would look very suspicious in  my bank account.”  “I  thought about it a little more and decided to ask that whenever I put  my hand in my pocket, I will always have the exact amount of money I  need for that situation in it. This way, I have seemingly infinite money  without the hassles of carrying it around and risking it being stolen.”  The  bartender, now impressed at his way of thinking, says “Wow, you seem really smart, I never would have thought of that. You found a creative way to get the benefits of infinite money without any of the dangers.”  “If your first wish was so ingenious, you surely must have asked for something equally clever for your other two wishes. So what did you ask for using your last two wishes?”, the bartender asks.  The man replies, “A chick with long legs and a big ass.”

1	If the Great War was a bar fight Germany, Austria and Italy are standing together in the middle of a pub when Serbia bumps into Austria and spills Austria's pint. Austria demands Serbia buy it a complete new suit because there are splashes on its trouser leg. Germany expresses its support for Austria's point of view. Britain recommends that everyone calm down a bit. Serbia points out that it can't afford a whole suit, but offers to pay for the cleaning of Austria's trousers. Russia and Serbia look at Austria. Austria asks Serbia who it's looking at. Russia suggests that Austria should leave its little brother alone. Austria inquires as to whose army will assist Russia in compelling it to do so.   Germany complains to Britain that France has been staring at it, and that this is sufficiently out of order that Britain should not intervene. Britain replies that France can look at who it wants to, that Britain is looking at Germany too, and what is Germany going to do about it? Germany tells Russia to stop staring at Austria, or Germany will render Russia incapable of such action. Britain and France ask Germany whether it's eying Belgium.  Turkey and Germany go off into a corner and whisper. When they come back, Turkey makes a show of not looking at anyone. Germany rolls up its sleeves, looks at France, and punches Belgium. France and Britain punch Germany. Austria punches Russia. Germany punches Britain and France with one hand and Russia with the other. Russia throws a punch at Germany, but misses and nearly falls over. Japan calls over from the other side of the room that it's on Britain's side, but stays there. Italy surprises everyone by punching Austria. Australia punches Turkey and gets punched back. There are no hard feelings because Britain made Australia do it. France gets thrown through a plate-glass window, but gets back up and carries on fighting. Russia gets thrown through another one, gets knocked out, suffers brain damage, and wakes up with a complete personality change. Italy throws a punch at Austria and misses, but Austria falls over anyway. Italy raises both fists in the air and runs round the room chanting.   America waits till Germany is about to fall over from sustained punching from Britain and France, then walks over and smashes it with a barstool, then pretends it won the fight all by itself. By now all the chairs are broken and the big mirror over the bar is shattered. Britain, France, and America agree that Germany threw the first punch, so the whole thing is Germany's fault. While Germany is still unconscious, they go through its pockets, steal its wallet, and buy drinks for all their friends.

2	A gorilla walks into a bar A  gorilla goes into a bar and orders a martini. This totally amazes the  bartender, but he thinks, "What the heck, I guess I might as well make  the drink." So he mixes the martini. He then walks back over to the give  it to the gorilla, and the animal is holding out a twenty-dollar bill.  Well, now the bartender is just at a loss for words. He can't believe  that a gorilla walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually  had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it.  So,  in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to  make the change. While he's standing in front of the cash register he  stops for a second and thinks to himself, "Let me try something here and  see if the gorilla notices anything."  So  he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. The  gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini.  After a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore.  "You know," he says to the gorilla, "we don't get too many gorillas in here."  And the gorilla says, "At nineteen dollars a drink I'm not surprised."

4	A woman grants her mother's unusual dying wish. She specifically requested pictures of her right foot be sent to an address in Rhode Island.  A couple of days later, she realizes that reversed pictures of her mother's *left* foot were sent instead. Unsure of the importance, but determined to fulfill her wishes, the woman travels to Rhode Island to inform the facility of the mistake.   After a long, arduous search, she finds an unmarked building in the middle of a thick forest. She rings the doorbell and, after a moment, a pleasant-looking man answers.   "Hello. I'm sorry to bother you, but my recently-deceased mother donated--"  "AH! You're Mary's daughter?" the man says, blocking the door slightly. "Yes, yes, she was a magnificent woman!"  "Yeah, well, in her dying wishes, it was noted that you requested photos of her right foot," she says, pulling out a photo packet. "These are the correct pictures. We sent you reversed photos of her left."  "Oh, excellent!" the man says, carefully taking the pictures. "Thank you so, so much. She was a long-time dear friend of the academy, and we are so grateful to honor her memory--"  The woman puts her hand up. "What's that sound...?"   Before he can stop her, the woman pushes past him and rushes into an adjacent room. There, projected on the wall, is a reversed picture of her mother's left foot...and a room full of people masturbating.  Enraged, she storms back to find the man sitting in the living room, waiting for her.  "WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN THERE?!"  "Look," he says. "I think we got off on the wrong foot here."

4	A blonde and a lawyer are on a plane And they’re sitting next to each other. The lawyer gets bored and decides to play a game.   He asks the blonde to join. The lawyer says “we’ll each ask each other a trivia question. If you get it right, you earn $5. If you get it wrong, the other person earns $5.”  Well, the blonde isn’t really interested. She turns away as if to take a nap. The lawyer says “okay okay okay, how about this. If I ask you a question and you get it wrong, you give me $5. But if you ask a question and I get it wrong, I’ll give you $100,00.”   Obviously now the blonde is interested, so she decides to play. The lawyer asks his question first. “What’s the distance between the Earth and the Moon?” Well, the blonde doesn’t know. So she hands the lawyer $5.   Now it’s the blonde’s turn. She asks the lawyer “what goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four?”   The lawyer is stumped. What could possibly go up a hill with three legs and come down with four? He begins to sweat. He starts asking other passengers. He pays for the in-flight internet to email his lawyer friends. Nobody knows. Nobody can help him.   Reluctantly, he writes a $100,00 check to the blonde. She smirks, takes his check, pockets it, and turns over, again wishing to get back to her nap.   The lawyer shakes her. “Hey wait,” he said. “What goes up a hill with three legs and comes down with four?”   The blonde hands him $5.

2	What a mistake to make A young monk arrives at the monastery. He is assigned to helping the other monks in copying the old canons and laws of the church by hand.  He notices, however, that all of the monks are copying from copies, not from the original manuscript. So the new monk goes to the head abbot to question this, pointing out that if someone made even a small error in the first copy, it would never be picked up! In fact, that error would be continued in all of the subsequent copies.  The head monk, says, 'We have been copying from the copies for centuries, but you make a good point, my son.' He goes down into the dark caves underneath the monastery where the original manuscripts are held as archives in a locked vault that hasn't been opened for hundreds of years.Hours go by and nobody sees the old abbot.  So, the young monk gets worried and goes down to look for him. He sees him banging his head against the wall and wailing.'We missed the R! We missed the R! We missed the R!!!'  His forehead is all bloody and bruised and he is crying uncontrollably. The young monk asks the old abbot, 'What's wrong, father?'With a choking and tear filled voice, the Abbot screams: "The word was... the word was... CELEBRATE!!!"

1	Tarzan was swinging through the jungle high in the canopy and his vine breaks.... He fell hitting jagged branches and thorns for about a hundred feet or so and slammed into the ground below wounded and dying.  A few hours later a witch doctor comes across him and decides to drag his lifeless body to his hut to try to help him. The witch Dr. examines Tarzan and sees that during his fall he was severely injured. His left eye was gouged out of his head, his right arm was dismembered and his cock was torn off completely.   The witch Dt. was very resourceful and a great shot with his blow dart and decided the he would search through the jungle for remedies.   First he saw an eagle soaring through the sky. He pulled out his blow dart gun, took aim and shot down the eagle. The Dr. Then removed it's eye and put it into Tarzan   He knew Tarzan needed an arm so went back out in the jungle and saw an ape swinging through the trees. He once again pulled out his trusty dart gun and took out the ape in one shot. He was then able to replace Tarzans arm.   Now he knew tarzan couldn't go through life without a dick. This proved to be difficult. He had to find something perfect. After a long search he finally came across an elephant grazing in a field. Like before using his blow gun he downed the creature, removed its trunk and attached it to Tarzan.   After a lengthy recovery Tarzan was finally well enough to return to the jungle.   After a few years the witch Dr. saw Tarzan swinging by and called out to him. "Tarzan, how are you doing? ' Tarzan replied thankfully ;" Amazing thank you Dr. With my eye i can see for miles and can protect the jungle from pochers. With my arm i can swing from vine to vine faster then ever and it has the strength of ten men.   Excitedly the Dr asked." What about your penis? "  To which Tarzan replied "It works great and the woman love it, but every time I walk through a field it shoves grass up my ass!"

1	When Beethoven passed away  When Beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried. Terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. The priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."  He listened a while longer, and said, "There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backwards, too. Most puzzling." So the magistrate kept listening; "There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."  Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, "My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing."

1	The horse and the chicken A horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. The horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. He calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. The chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. So he drives the farmer's BMW back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. He then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking! A few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken falls into the mud hole. The chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. The horse said, "I think I can stand over the hole!" So he stretched over the width of the hole and said, "Grab my penis and pull yourself up." So the chicken did and pulled himself to safety. Moral of the Story: If you're hung like a horse, you don't need a BMW to pick up chicks.
1	My Dad told me this one a long time ago and I still remember it every time we have meatballs. There is a man who goes to a spanish restaurant after a big bull fight. He sits down and looks at the menu. The waiter then comes over and asks what he will have. The man once again looks down at the menu and spots “meatballs de toro”.  The man decides to have these.  Later, the waiter comes back out with these two massive steaming meatballs on a nice place of spaghetti. The man eats them up and they are delicious.  Weeks later, the man goes back to the same restaurant after another bull fight and gets the meatballs again. Like last time, two massive steaming meatballs come out and they are amazing.  The third time this man comes to the restaurant after a bull fight, he orders the meatballs still. When they come out, these two scrawny, tiny meatballs come out on the plate and the man asks the waiter why they are so small.  The waiter says “Oh Senor, the matador, he don’t always win”.

The devil says that there are 3 other people here that have done less bad than Trump, so Trump gets to decide which one goes to heaven so he can take their place.  The devil opens 3 doors, the first door has Richard Nixon in it. Nixon is swimming around a big pool nonstop.  The devil asked Trump if he would like to take Nixon's place.  Trump declined, and said that he was not a very good swimmer, and would get tired way to quickly.  The devil moves on, and opens the second door. Inside this room is Andrew Jackson. Andrew Jackson was running on the treadmill for eternity. The devil once again asked Trump if he would like to take his place.  "NO WAY"!, said Trump. "I get very dehydrated and my ankles swell up when I run, even if I run for 1 minute".  So, the devil led Trump to the last room. Inside this room was Bill Clinton, sitting on a chair, arms over his head, legs spread eagle. Also in the room was Melania Trump, sucking Bill Clinton real good.  The devil asked Trump one more time which room he choses, and who he would like to take the place of.  Trump, without hesitation, choses room #3.  Now, the devil snaps his fingers, and Melania floats off into heaven.

So the first man steps forward and says “That’s me! I was convinced my wife was cheating and left work early to catch her in the act. I burst into the bedroom and find her in bed, the sheets are a mess, the smell of sex is in the air, but she swears she was just sleeping, I search the apartment high and low and eventually find a man dangling from the balcony!!

The first leprechaun, even more annoyed, screams, "tell me father, in all your travels around the world, from all for corners of it, have you ever met a leprechaun nun?!?!"

The second leprechaun is now rolling on the floor, tears streaming down his face in laughter, screams out, "I told you that you fucked a penguin!"

1	A story of frugality. Every morning, the CEO of a large bank in Manhattan walks to the corner where a shoe shine is always located.  He sits on the couch, examines the Wall Street Journal, and the shoe shine gives his shoes a shiny, excellent look.  One morning the shoeshine asks the Executive Director:  "What do you think about the situation in the stock market?"   The Director asks in turn arrogantly:  "Why are you so interested in that - that topic?"  "I have a million dollars in your bank," the shoeshine says, "and I'm considering investing some of the money in the capital market."   "What your name? –"Asks the Director.  "John Smith."  The Director arrives at the bank and asks the Manager of the Customer Department:   "Do we have a client named John Smith?"  "Certainly –"answers the Customer Service Manager–, "he is a highly esteemed customer. He has a million dollars in his account."  The Director comes out, approaches the shoeshine, and says:  "Mr. Smith, I ask you this coming Monday to be the guest of honor at our board meeting and tell us the story of your life. I am sure we will have something to learn from you."  At the board meeting, the Executive Director introduces him to the board members:  "We all know Mr. Smith, who makes our shoes shine in the corner; But Mr. Smith is also our esteemed customer with a million dollars in his account. I invited him to tell us the story of his life. I am sure we can learn from him."  Mr. Smith began his story:  "I came to this country fifty years ago as a young immigrant from Europe with an unpronounceable name. I got off the ship without a penny. The first thing I did was change my name to Smith. I was hungry and exhausted. I started wandering around looking for a job but to no avail. Suddenly I found a coin on the sidewalk. I bought an apple. I had two options: eat the apple and quench my hunger or start a business. I sold the apple for two dollars and bought two apples with the money. I also sold them and continued in business. When I started accumulating dollars, I was able to buy a set of used brushes and shoe polish and started polishing shoes. I didn't spend a penny on entertainment or clothing, I just bought bread and some cheese to survive. I saved penny by penny and after a while, I bought a new set of shoe brushes and ointments in different shades and expanded my clientele. I lived like a monk and saved penny by penny. After a while I was able to buy an armchair so that my clients could sit comfortably while cleaning their shoes, and that brought me more clients. I did not spend a penny on the joys of life. I kept saving every penny. A few years ago, when the previous shoe shine on the corner decided to retire, I had already saved enough money to buy his shoeshine location at this great place.  Finally, three months ago, my sister, who was a whore in Chicago, passed away and left me a million dollars."

The man groans, but the doctor goes on, "You have $9000 in insurance compensation coming and we now have the technology to build a new penis.  They work great, but they don't come cheap. It's roughly $1000 an inch."  The man perks up. So, the doctor says, "You must decide how many inches you want. But understand that you have been married for over thirty years and this is something you should discuss with your wife. If you had a five-incher before and get a nine-incher now she might be a bit put out. If you had a nine-incher before and you decide to invest in a five-incher now, she might be disappointed. It's important that she plays a role in helping you make a decision."  The man agrees to talk it over with his wife. The doctor comes back the next day, "So, have you spoken with your wife?"  "Yes I have," says the man.  "And has she helped you make a decision?"  "Yes," says the man.  "What is your decision?" asks the doctor.  "We're getting granite counter tops."

A man buys a new motorcycle on the day he is to visit his girlfriend’s family for the first time.  After handing his the keys, the sales man hands him a jar of Vaseline and says “if you want to keep the fender looking shiny you will want to rub some Vaseline on the fenders before it rains. It’ll stop the water from making spots and rusting the metal.” The guys thanks him and goes to pick up his girlfriend.   The girlfriend says “in my family we have a weird thing where we don’t talk during dinner, in fact the one that talks has to do the dishes.” The guy thought odd but I’ll play along. They arrive at her family’s home and there are dirty dishes piled everywhere. On the floor, tables, chairs, dirty dishes just stacked everywhere.   Introductions are made and the family sits down to dinner where everyone falls silent. The guy thought, I could have some fun with this. He grabs the girlfriend by the waist, pulls her close, passionately kissing her. Silence at the table. He begins undressing himself and her, throws her on the table, and begins feverishly making love to her. Still silence. They finish, and the meal continues as if nothing had happened.   The guy thinks ok let’s see how far this can go. He grabs his girlfriends mother, throws her into his arms and plants a big kiss on her. Dead. Silence. He grabs her, throws her down on the dirty dish covered table, and makes love to her as well. He finishes and not a word is said. Just then in the distance he hears thunder. Remembering the salesmans advice from earlier he reaches into his pocket and pulls out the jar of Vaseline. Just then the father stands up and shouts “fine I’ll do the damn dishes!”

2	Area 51 You've all heard of the Air Force's ultra-high-security, super-secret  base in Nevada, known simply as "Area 51?"     Well, late one afternoon, the Air Force folks out at Area 51 were  very surprised to see a Cessna landing at their "secret" base. They  immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an  interrogation room.     The pilot's story was that he took off from Vegas, got lost, and  spotted the Base just as he was about to run out of fuel.  The Air  Force started a full FBI background check on the pilot and held him  overnight during the investigation.     By the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really  was lost and wasn't a spy. They gassed up his airplane, gave him a  terrifying "you-did-not-see-a-base" briefing, complete with threats  of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him Vegas was  that-a-way on such and such a heading, and sent him on his way.     The next day, to the total disbelief of the Air Force, the same  Cessna showed up again. Once again, the MP's surrounded the  plane...only this time there were two people in the plane.     The same pilot jumped out and said, "Do anything you want to me, but  my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where I was last  night!"

A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.  The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’ The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’  Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.  She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.  The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’  Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’  While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.  He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’  They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’  He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.  After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’  He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’  Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’  ‘I was behind you at McDonalds’.

Let's say that... Well, your son was born without legs."  "Without..  Legs? Oh my god."  The doctor inhales. "I'm afraid that's not everything . See, your son was also born without any arms."  "Without arms? So my son has no limbs and you couldn't see that coming ?!"  "Well, I wouldn't say that's the only... Abnormality. Your son was also born without a chest."  "What?"  "... And he also has no eyes."  "WHAT?"  "... And no nose either!"  "my son doesn't have a nose?!"  "... And he doesn't have a mouth!!"  At this point, the man loses it.

As he gets closer, he can see her holding a huge human ear in her arms. The man is speechless. He carefully takes his son in his hands, and, clearly moved, starts talking to him.  " My son.. My... Beautiful son. I've been waiting for this moment for a long time. Listen, I don't care if you were born without arms, and without legs, and you have no body nor eyes or mouth. Because I love you, son, no matter what. I am your father, and I promise you I'll protect you and make sure you'll have the best life possible".  At this point, the doctor approaches the man and says:   "Excuse me, sir. You should speak louder. He's also deaf."

The answer by one student was so 'profound' that the professor shared it with colleagues, via the Internet, which is, of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well:   Bonus Question: Is Hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?   Most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using Boyle's Law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.   One student, however, wrote the following: First, we need to know how the mass of Hell is changing in time. So we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into Hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. I think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to Hell, it will not leave. Therefore, no souls are leaving. As for how many souls are entering Hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.   Most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to Hell. Since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to Hell. With birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in Hell to increase exponentially. Now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in Hell because Boyle's Law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in Hell to stay the same, the volume of Hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.   This gives two possibilities:   1. If Hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter Hell, then the temperature and pressure in Hell will increase until all Hell breaks loose.   2. If Hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in Hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until Hell freezes over.   So which is it?   If we accept the postulate given to me by Teresa during my Freshman year that, 'It will be a cold day in Hell before I sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that I slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus I am sure that Hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. The corollary of this theory is that since Hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct..... ...leaving only Heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, Teresa kept shouting "Oh my God."        THIS STUDENT RECEIVED AN A+.
2	The departing division general manager met a last time with his young successor and gave him three envelopes. "My predecessor did this for me,and I'll pass the tradition along to you," he said.  "At the first sign of trouble, open the first envelope.  Any further difficulties, open the second envelope.  Then, if problems continue, open the third envelope. Good luck."   The new manager returned to his office and tossed the envelopes into a drawer.   Six months later, costs soared and earnings plummeted. Shaken, the young man opened the first envelope, which said, "Blame it all on me."  The next day, he held a press conference and did just that.  The crisis passed.  Six months later, sales dropped precipitously.  The beleaguered manager opened the second envelope.  It said, "Reorganise."   He held another press conference, announcing that the division would be restructured.  The crisis passed.   A year later, everything went wrong at once and the manager was blamed for all of it.  The harried executive closed his office door, sank into his chair, and opened the third envelope.  "Prepare three envelopes..." it said.     \\-- source: found on 'fortune'

1	A travelling salesman drives through a small town he's never been to before... He pulls up at the gas station where an old Native America man is sitting. The salesman walks up and says, "How!"  "Hello," the old Native guy says.  "What's your story?" the salesman asks.  "I have the world's greatest memory. I never forget a thing."  "Oh really?" the salesman says. "Well, what did you have for breakfast on March 9, 1963?"  The old Native guy says, "On March 9, 1963, I had eggs for breakfast."  "Sure," the salesman says. "That doesn't prove anything. Everybody has eggs for breakfast." And the guy gets in his car and drives off.   Twenty-five years pass. He builds a successful business, gets married, has kids, loses his wife to cancer, and sends his kids off to college. Then one day he loses everything. He decides to go back out on the road as a salesman again.   By chance, he happens to drive through that same small town. He sees the same Native man still sitting in front of the gas station. He walks up and says, "How."  The old native man says, "Scrambled."

I c-c-can’t st-st-stop st-st-stuttering!” So the doctor calms him down and says “we’ll need to do a throughout physical examination to see what’s the root cause of this.  At the end the doctor tells him “I know what’s causing your problem, your penis is too big! All the blood is going there, thus decreasing the blood flow to the speech centers of your brain.” So the guy asked “well what c-c-can I d-d-do to f-f-fix this?” The doctor responded “it’s a simple procedure, but what you need is a penis reduction. Are you ok with that?” The man quickly nodded his head and said “Of c-c-course, I t-t-trust you d-d-doc.” The procedure was a success and the man could speak normally again, but as he started to get intimate with women again he noticed that he wasn’t getting the same reaction as he used to. He used to leave girls shaking and ranting to all their friends about him. So he decided to go back to the doctor. When he got there he said “hey Doc, look I know the procedure helped me talk normal, but I want my old dick back! It’s just not the same with the ladies anymore.” To which the doctor said “g-g-go f-f-f*ck yourself.”

1	A man in Shanghai named Sam wakes up one morning to find... A man in Shanghai named Sam wakes up one morning to find that his car, a Mustang, has had all the internal components removed, leaving only a hollow, useless shell. He calls the police and soon an investigative team arrives.    The lead investigator approaches the victim and says "It appears this is the doing of a car stealing king pin known as Ling. Gutting a car this way is his signature crime, especially Mustangs."   Sam asks "So he's done this before? Why haven't you caught him yet? You even know his name!"   The lead investigator laughs "You make it out to be so easy! We know his name only because he always leaves a note... Look here there's one tucked under your wiper... But do you know how many Lings there are in Shanghai? Thousands! One does not simply walk in and arrest someone for being named Ling!"   Sam protests "But we must do something!"   "Just let us do our job. You can give your statement to my assistant." The investigator says dismissively.   Furious the victim decides to take matters into his own hands and hire a private detective. While searching online he finds a Private Eye who goes by the name of Wan Ling. "Curious" he thinks, but calls the guy anyways. After explaining the situation, he asks if Wan Ling will take the job.   "I will take it. I will take this Ling to justice." He replies. "But it will take an elaborate trap. Give me a week to set it up."   A week-ish later Wan calls and asks the victim to meet him at an abandoned warehouse in the industrial district. They huddle behind the building near the utilities box and Wan explains:   "I've narrowed the suspects down to just nineteen Lings. I've lured them here using an elaborate scheme, but now comes the moment of truth. I'm going in there and if everything goes to plan I should be able to identify the real culprit. So listen through this air vent here, and when you here me use the code word 'Melon' then flip that breaker to kill the lights and I'll cuff the bad guy."   "Got it." Sam says nervously.   "Don't worry" Wan replies "I've called my friends Glenn Frey, and Don Henley. They're coming for back up."   Wan disappears into the warehouse. Sam can hear chatter and then after a short while the key word "Melon". He kills the lights, there are sounds of a struggle. Finally Wan's voice rings loud and clear: "I've got him, I've got the real Ling".   Sam hastily turns the lights back on and comes in to see eighteen astonished Lings looking at Wan Ling standing over a handcuffed and sulking culprit.   And that's why the saying goes:   Wan Ling to lure them all, one Ling to find him. Wan Ling to bring them all and in the darkness bind him.

The lion abruptly stops and says "woah! This guy seems tougher then he looks, I better leave while I can".  Over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. Evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. So the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily "get on my back, we'll get him together".  So they start rushing back to the dog. The dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. He then gets another idea and shouts "where the hell is that monkey! I told him to bring me another lion an hour ago..."

May I ask if you would fondle my breasts?.  So he gets down on his knees & not only fondles but kisses and sucks on her nipples till she's about falling out of her chair with pleasure.  Breathlessly she whispers in his ear, "Mr. I've never been fucked. How about it."  So the salesman picks her up out of her chair and starts to carry her toward her bedroom, when he turns and takes her outside along side a pond behind the house.  Tossing her into the pond he yells to her: "Well, now you're FUCKED!"
1	An old man lay on his death bed upstairs when he caught a wiff An old man lay dying in bed upstairs in his room when he thought he caught a wiff of his wife's chocolate chip cookies wafting through the air.  Man, he thought to himself, if I could have just one more of my wife's cookies I could die a happy man.    As he lay there thinking about the singular joy of those delightful cookies his wife had been making him so many years he became certain that she was in fact making a fresh batch.  He also became certain, no he resolved himself, that he would not die until he had another cookie.  He couldn't call out as he'd been without voice for some time.  He figured it was useless to hope anyone would just bring a dying man a cookie.  So he decided that he would marshall all of what little strength he had left and he would go downstairs and get one.  He knew that this effort would be his last but that having one last cookie before he went would be one of the happiest moments in his life.  With a Herculean effort the old man slid his feet out of the bed and to the floor.  His legs didn't quite have the strength to carry him and he slid all the way to the floor.  He rested a minute and then he turned over onto his stomach an crawled like an infant out of his room over to the stairs.  The stairs presented the old man a special challenge: he couldn't crawl down them as his arms were not strong enough to do so.  So with great effort he got to his feet and leaned up against the rail and started making his way down.    He almost gave up but halfway down the stairs the smell of the scrumptious chocolate chip cookies was so strong he knew that he just couldn't quit.    After about an hour he made it safely to the bottom of the stairs, a mere ten feet from the kitchen where his heavenly cookies awaited him.    The old man crawled the last ten feet.  He could see stacks and stacks of sweet delicious cookies on the kitchen table.  He had almost no strength left at all and he could feel the wind of death at his back.  It was now or never.   With great effort he pulled his chest up onto the seat of the chair.  He couldn't get any higher.  But he reached out his left arm, an arm shaking side to side, up and down on it's ascent to the table top.  For a second it didn't look like he'd even be able to grab a cookie but somehow he managed.    As he brought that glorious cookie down off that table and towards his dying lips the old man's wife appeared and snatched the cookie right out of his hand saying "You stay out of these, these cookies are for the funeral".

1	It was autumn, and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets.  When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.  Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, "Is the coming winter going to be cold?"  "It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed," the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.  A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. "Is it going to be a very cold winter?"  "Yes," the man at National Weather Service again replied,"it's definitely going to be a very cold winter." The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.  Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. "Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?"  "Absolutely," the man replied. "It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever."  "How can you be so sure?" the Chief asked.  The weatherman replied, "The Indians are collecting wood like crazy."

1	An old man grabs a seat at the bar... An old man grabs a seat at the bar and order a double scotch, which the barman promptly serves him. After drinking all his glass in one shot, he asks for another one, which the barman serves him.   The old man then say "How about a little friendly bet my friend?". The barman repond "why not" and ask what the bet will be.   The old man says "Alright, so i'll bet you 20$ that i can bite my left eye". The barman is puzzled, but accept the bet. The old man then removes his glass eyeball and bites it, right before drinking his second glass of scotch in one shot.   The barman is a bit angry to have been played like that, but gives him 20$.   The old man then order a third double scotch and while the barman is pouring, says "How about another bet ? 20$ that i can bite my right eye this time !"   The barman is still a bit frustrated from his previous loss, but ends up agreeing to the second bet. There's no way this man have two glass eyeballs, right ?. The old man then takes his denture out and bites his right eye with it, before drinking his double scotch in one shot.   The barman is getting angry, but decide to just throw a 20$ at the old man and be done with it. The old man, who is now visibly slightly impaired by all those drinks, get off the stool and say "Alright, alright, i'll play fair. I'll give you a chance to win your money back and even a bit more." He then point at the empty glass. "See my empty glass there ? I'll bet you 100$ that i can pee inside it without spilling a single drop around it".  The barman thinks for a whole ten seconds.. there's no way someone can do that after drinking three double scotch. So he agrees, while still hoping he didn't make a mistake. The old man then climbs on the bar, get on his feet and quickly proceed to do his thing. As the barman predicted, he failed miserably. There is urine everywhere on the bar and on the stool, even a bit on the barman's apron, and only a few drops managed to reach the inside of the glass.  The barman can't help it but laugh out loud at the poor old man for over twenty seconds. The old man then climb down the bar and hands a 100$ with a large smile. The barman takes the money and asks him why he is smiling like that after losing and looking so ridicuous.   The old man point at a table where four men are seated, all looking completely devastated. "You see those gentlemen there at the table ? Well, i did bet 500$ to every single one of them that i would climb on your bar, pee everywhere... and that it will make you laugh !"

2	Lobster Tails A man was driving through town with his windows down when he heard a man at a small roadside stand yelling, "Lobster tails! Get your lobster tails here only two dollars!"  The man hit his brakes and pulled over. He walked up to the salesman thinking this must be too good to be true.  "Are you really only charging two dollars for lobster tails?"  "Yessir! Whaddya looking for, a long one or a short one? Both only two bucks."  "How about the longest one you got!"   The man handed the salesman two 1 dollar bills. The salesman thanked him and instructed him to sit in a nearby chair as he knelt down under the counter. The man thought that was strange, but complied, happily awaiting his lobster tail.   After a minute, the salesman popped up from under the counter with a large book. He opened the book to the front page, cleared his throat, and began to read :  "Once upon a time, there was a lobster..."

1	The Ivory Throne of the King of Timbuktu Hundreds of years ago, when glorious Timbuktu was nothing more than a large collection of grass huts, the King of that great city declared his wish for a throne fit for such a mighty ruler. Of ivory it was to be, exquisitely carved, inlaid with gold leaf, decorated with diamonds and emeralds and sapphires and rubies and pearls, and cushioned with a cushion of purple velvet stuffed with pure white goose down. Thereupon hunters were sent forth to hunt elephants for the ivory, and merchants to procure the precious metals and stones, and when the materials were all ready a band of the most skilled carvers and craftsmen set to work to create the wonderful throne.  Unfortunately, the throne took so long to build that the King had died of extreme old age before it could be completed, and of his sons, only one remained, and he a little child of but four years. Therefore the council of elders discussed the matter, and appointed the wisest of them to serve as a regent until the King's son should attain to his manhood. But the regent said: "Let me not sully with my low-born body this throne that was crafted for a king, lest I forget myself and be lost to pride. Upon a wooden stool only let me sit, and let the throne be borne away and placed in storage in an empty house" (grass hut, of course) "where none shall gaze upon it until it be occupied by a king as it was intended".  This was done, and for seventeen years a regiment of the King's own guard kept watch upon the house, taking turn and turn about to see that none should gaze upon the throne; then at last the King's son attained his manhood, and preparations were made for the coronation, and bearers were sent to fetch the marvellous throne so that the new King might be seated upon it. But when the bearers entered the empty house, they were stricken with horror. For lo! the grass walls and roof had failed utterly to keep out the dry and wet rot, the ants and the termites, boring beetles, silverfish and mould; and at the lightest touch the throne crumbled into ivory dust, with here and there a gleam of gold leaf, a sparkle of coloured light from a precious stone, a strand of purple velvet or a mere speck of pure white goose down.  And the only moral it is possible to draw from this unhappy tale is: *People who live in grass houses shouldn't stow thrones.*

2	A man walks into a bar and says he'll drink anything that has gin in it The Bartender decides he wants to impress the man with something creative. He grabs some cold-pressed mango juice from the refrigerator, squeezes in the juice from a small lemon, adds some ginger ale, and garnishes it with rosemary and an orange twist. Finally he adds the gin.  As the man finishes the drink, the Bartender asks "how did you like it?" and the man in the red hat dismissively says, "I liked the gin."  The Bartender is miffed that that was the only thing the man had to comment on, so he makes a new drink. He drops a spoon of peanut butter into a glass, adds black pepper, squeezes a portion of mustard, and splashes in some tap water to mix them together. Then he adds the gin and places it in front of the man. The man finishes the yellow-brown cloudy mess and the Bartender snarks, "did you still enjoy your drink?" And the man in the red hat says, "well it had gin in it, didn't it?"  Now the Bartender is pissed. He takes some water from the sink of dirty plates, he squirts in some dish soap too for good measure. He blends it together with some banana peels and chicken bones he found in the garbage, and puts the goo into a glass. Then he looks out the front of the bar and spots a dog shit sitting on the grass right outside the door. He walks out and scoops a tablespoonful of the dog shit. The Bartender then places the glass of goo in front of the man, looks him dead in the eye as he dumps the dog turd in, and carefully adds three drops of gin.  The man looks in horror at the dark sludge. He picks up the glass and drinks it with a visual grimace, then swallows.  The Bartender explodes, "I can't believe this, how did you train yourself to swallow literal dog shit just because it has a little bit of something you like?"  "Well you see," the man says as he places down the glass, "I'm a pro life Republican"

When our troops march we give them 150lb packs *and* they thank us for it".  The American thinks for a moment before saying "When on manoeuvres, our soldiers eat 4000 calories a day". The Russian jumps to his feet "AHA! Now I *know* you are lying! Nobody can eat that many potatoes!"

The Russian says, “That, gentlemen, is courage."  The American says, “That's nothing.”  He calls over a PO and says, “I want you to jump off the bows. Swim under the ship to the stern and then return."  The PO salutes, jumps off the bow, swims to the stern, and climbs back up to stand in front of the admiral and salutes.  The American says, “That, gentlemen, is courage."  The British admiral says, “That's nothing. Sailor, come here."  The matelot comes to attention and salutes.  The admiral says, “I want you to climb the highest mast on the carrier, jump off, swim under the boat from bow to stern and then from beam to beam then climb up the mast and do it again."  The matelot looks at the admiral and says, “You can fuck right off, sir!”  The admiral turns to the other two and says, “And that, gentlemen, is courage."

In fact, he couldn't bring himself to tell his fiancee' about his leg when he slipped the ring on her finger, nor when she bought the dress, nor when they picked the time and place.   All he kept saying was, "*Darling, I've got a big surprise for you,*" at which she blushed and smiled bewitchingly.   The wedding night came and went, and the young couple were at last alone in their hotel room.   "*Now don't forget, Mark, you promised me a big surprise,*" said the bride.   Unable to say a word, Mark turned out the lights, unstrapped his wooden leg, slipped into bed, and placed his wife's hand on the stump.   "*Hmmmmm,*" she said softly, "*that IS a surprise. But pass me the Vaseline and I'll see what I can do!*"
1	A construction crew started building a new house down the street. My daughter was excited to see the big construction vehicles, so I let her go check it out (with me watching of course). The crew loved that a young person was interested in construction, so let her sit and watch them work.  Sometimes they would sit her in the trucks and show her how it operates, even gave her a few odd jobs here and there, made her feel like part of the team.  The crew boss even noticed, and after a week, they gave her a pay envelope of ten dollars.  I thought this was so great, and the crew was so nice, so I took my daughter down to the bank to open a savings account, teaching her about the work force, how pay works, what a bank does, and the importance of money.  I told the teller at the bank the whole story about the construction crew, her interest in working, and that I’m teaching her the value of the dollar. The teller smiles at my daughter and goes,  “This is such an important lesson for life, and I’m so glad that you’re learning this now. Tell me...would you go back next week and work with those guys?”  My daughter sits back in her chair and says,  “We will, if those fucking assholes can finally deliver that goddamn sheetrock!”

1	A man walks into a restaurant with an ostrich... ... and sits down. The man tells the ostrich "sit" and it sits down. The man orders 2 lasagnas and 2 beers (one of each for himself and the other for the ostrich). The waitress is a little bemused but goes along and gets it. The bill arrives = $25.87. Without looking, the man puts his hand into his pocket, pulls out exact change, keeps it on the table and then he and the ostrich leave. Over the course of the next few weeks, the exact same thing happens. Out of curiosity one day, the waitress asks the man "how is it that you can pay the exact amount without looking and what is with the ostrich?" The man sighs and says "One day, I was walking on the beach and I found this lamp. I rubbed it and out came a genie who granted me 2 wishes". I said "I always want to be able to pay for everything I want with exact change and I want to have a chick with long legs who listens to everything I say".

Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, ‟What?”  He heard, ‟This is the police. What’s going on down there?”  The man replied, ‟I am checking  out the rear axle, it is busted.”  ‟Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you’re down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.”

Your diagnosis is most certainly correct, she’s very active in the church, but how did you arrive at it?”    “I did what you did at the last house. I dropped my stethoscope and, when I bent down to retrieve it, I noticed the priest under the bed.”

"Too tight," the speaker told him.  "I have one more pair."  The speaker tried them and they fit perfectly.  With that, he ate his meal and gave his speech.  When the dinner was over, he went to thank the man who'd helped him.  "Where's your office?" he inquired. "I'm looking for a good dentist."  The man replied: "I'm not a dentist. I'm an undertaker."

2	A man walks into a bar in Vegas. A man walks into a bar in Vegas.  He has a parrot with him. This parrot is wholly remarkable; it is fluent in Spanish, French and English. So, being a betting man- they're all betting men down in Vegas -he goes up to the bartender and tells him, "I'll bet you this here bird can speak Spanish."  The bartender knows this type, and slams his hand down on the counter with a $10 bill. "You're on! Let's see it."  So the man turned to the bird and asks, "Hablas Espanol?"  The bird is silent as a stone.  "Well, watch this, then, he can speak French too. Parlez-vous Francais?"  The parrot remains silent. The man is sweating through his jacket, and the bartender is chuckling derisively. "Hand over the cash, sir, and have a nice night."  As he walks dejectedly out of the bar, the man turns to the parrot. "You jerk!", he cries. "You cost me ten bucks!"  The parrot, taken aback, ruffles his feathers arrogantly. "Cost you? Buddy, I just made you a fortune! Think of the odds you can get there tomorrow!"

There's even logisticians, mathematicians, a pirate, and a crocodile.  Overcoming a moment of awe, the man approaches the barkeep. "Hello, I'd like one karma, please." The barkeep pauses for a moment then lets out a jolly belly laugh. "You hear that, boys, we've got a karma whore! Sorry son, that's not how things work around here. You've gotta earn it."  Dismayed, the karma whore responds "So what do I have to do? I just repost something that's already gotten upvotes, right?" More serious now, the barkeep responds "It's not that easy son. The timing is everything. First of all, all the dead horses have already been beaten. If I hear one more Yoda joke this week, throw you out I will. And don't even get me started with HD vs. UHD."  Thinking harder, the karma whore asks "What about that jar on the bar full of cash? Can't I put in ten bucks, drink a bottle of tequila, and go do some errands to earn it?" Sadder now, the barkeep responds "Sorry, but we've had to put that on hold for a while. The alley dog's been going to therapy, and I've run out of cleaning supplies for the room upstairs. You're just going to have to get in line like everyone else."  Looking at the line, the man sees many of the aforementioned /r/jokes regulars and asks "so that's the line for karma?" In unison, the line shouts out "No, it's the line to OP's mom!"  The karma whore jumps in line, but is immediately smacked in the face by the Russian in front of him. "WHAT WAS THAT FOR?!?" cried the karma whore.  The Russian replies "In /r/jokes, line punches YOU."

She doesn't know which one to get so she just grabs one and goes over to the counter. A Bass Pro Shop associate is standing there wearing dark shades.   She says, ’Excuse me, sir. Can you tell me anything about this rod and reel?'     He says, 'Ma'am, I'm completely blind; but if you'll drop it on the counter, I can tell you   Everything from the sound it makes.'     She doesn’t believe him but drops it on the counter anyway.  He says, 'That's a six-foot Shakespeare graphite rod with a Zebco 404 reel and 10-LB. Test line. It's a good all around combination and it’s on sale this week for only $20.00.     She says, 'It's amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. I'll take it!' As she opens her purse, her credit card drops on the floor.     'Oh, that sounds like a Master Card,' he says.     She bends down to pick it up and accidentally farts. At first she is really embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way the blind clerk could tell it was she who tooted. Being blind, he wouldn't know that she was the only person around.

1	The Gorilla Joke my dad told far too often! So I was walking around the local shopping centre recently when I bumped into an old university friend. We chatted for ages, he told me how successful his business had been and I told him about my wife and kids.   A little while on as we stroll towards the exit he suggests I come over to his house, I accept and we walk towards the main doors, curiously away from the car park. As we leave the doors a Bentley pulls up and the back doors open, I’m taken aback, his business really is doing well! So we drive back towards his house, finally arriving at these enormous gates. As they slowly open, exposing the house hidden behind, I am astounded by the size of this house. Before me is a 3 storey Georgian Mansion with a long gravel drive leading to it. My jaw is wide open.   We pull up and his staff hurry around us, collecting bags opening doors, taking coats - I was shocked. The front doors swing open and I stood in the largest reception hall I’d ever been in. He turns to me and asks if I want a tour. Obviously I want a tour! We wonder round his house, from room to room chatting for about an hour, finally finishing in one of his gorgeous reception rooms. It was here where his whole demeanour changed. His face becomes very serious, his voice drops and his shoulders hunch apprehensively. Very quietly he turns to me and says, ‘looks, there’s something I want to show you, I’ve never showed anyone this but I want to show you, I need to show you’. I should have been more careful but my curiosity was peaked. I said okay.   He stepped back then, and removed a chain from around his neck, on it was a key. He lent down and tossed the carpet to the side. Below it was a huge door or hatch. He put the key in and unlocked it, he then heaved and enormously thick door up. Behind the door was a long set of stairs going far into the dark. We started walking down the stairs and eventually approach a second door. This time my friend bent down and removed a key from his sock. Unlocked the door and swung an even thicker door open. Behind this door was yet more stairs but this time there was a light at the bottom. We walk down the last few steps and my friend pulled a key from his trouser pocket. He unlocked the last door, the thickest of the three and swung it open.   We entered a dark damp room, the only thing I could really see was some thick steel bars, really thick bars. My friend turned around and turned the lights on, as my eyes adjusted I finally saw it. A 15ft Gorilla sotting hunched over in the corner. It was the biggest thing I’d ever seen. I stepped back kinda terrified but then realised that it looked sad, I stepped gently closer staring at the beast. It was amazing. Just then a buzzer in the room went off, the butler from upstairs told my friend he had a caller upstairs, he sighed, gave my the three keys and said he had the take the call and wouldn’t be very long. He started to walk off but then turned sharply and said ‘make sure, whatever you do, do NOT touch him’, I laughed and said why on earth would I touch him! My friend laughed and went off up the stairs.   I stood there staring at the giant gorilla for about 10 minutes but my friend never returned. I started getting closer to the cage and began realising the gorilla was harmless, cute even. He rocked gently towards the bars and sat right next to me, it was nice. I ignored my friend because damn he looked cute, I figured what the hell and gently stroked his forehead. As I did it the enormous gorilla jumped to feet and roared, I jumped backwards terrified. The gorilla then began pulling the enormous bars and to my horror they began to bend. I ran, swung the door open and slammed it behind me, I pulled out the key and locked it but as I did that the gorilla slammed into the door and started pounding on it. I turned and ran up the stairs. I opened the next one ran through and locked it behind me, but just as slammed that door I heard the bottom door get ripped off. I ran up the last set of stairs, got the door, opened it, closed it, locked it. I could already hear the gorilla charging up the last few steps having already destroyed the second door.   I ran outside the house, to my joy there was a Lamborghini sitting in the drive, I ran over to it and sat in the drivers seat but was presented with 10s of buttons, I don’t know how to turn it on! I panic and press everything, finally the engine revs. Just as it does this the gorilla bursts out of the front of the house and sees me. I hit the accelerator and fly down the drive and onto the motorway, I am driving at 100+ mph but I can still see him in the rear view mirror. I drive and drive but he’s still following me. I suddenly see a sign to a private airport and come off the motorway with the gorilla still in pursuit. I stop the car at the front entrance, run inside and throw all my money at the till, thankfully I immediately board a plane and we start taxing. I breathe a sigh of relief as we start our take off but suddenly alarms start going off and I can feel the rear of the plane being pulled down. The gorilla is pulling us down!!   The plane skids and crashes down, we deploy the emergency slides and I am first off. I ran as hard as I can but I can hear him pounding behind me. I turn a corner and to my horror it’s a dead end. I turn, the gorilla smiles, he knows he’s got me. He walks slowly towards me, slightly rocking the ground. I shake with fear, this is it. He comes right up next to me, reaches his enormous arm out, placing his hand on me, says ‘you’re it’ and runs off.
1	Cat v Dog Diaries I'm sure this has probably been posted here before, but since I'm having my 'special' day, I'd thought I'd post my favorite joke.   &#x200B;  **The Dog’s Diary**  8:00 am - Dog food! My favorite thing!    9:30 am - A car ride! My favorite thing!    9:40 am - A walk in the park! My favorite thing!     10:30 am - Got rubbed and petted! My favorite thing!    12:00 pm - Milk bones! My favorite thing!    1:00 pm - Played in the yard! My favorite thing!    3:00 pm - Wagged my tail! My favorite thing!    5:00 pm - Dinner! My favorite thing!    7:00 pm - Got to play ball! My favorite thing!    8:00 pm - Wow! Watched TV with the people! My favorite thing!    11:00 pm - Sleeping on the bed! My favorite thing!  ***The Cat’s Diary***   **Day 983 of My Captivity**     My captors continue to taunt me with bizarre little dangling objects. They dine lavishly on fresh meat, while the other inmates and I are fed hash or some sort of dry nuggets. Although I make my contempt for the rations perfectly clear, I nevertheless must eat something in order to keep up my strength.     The only thing that keeps me going is my dream of escape. In an attempt to disgust them, I once again vomit on the carpet. Today I decapitated a mouse and dropped its headless body at their feet. I had hoped this would strike fear into their hearts, since it clearly demonstrates my capabilities. However, they merely made condescending comments about what a “good little hunter” I am. Bastards!     There was some sort of assembly of their accomplices tonight. I was placed in solitary confinement for the duration of the event. However, I could hear the noises and smell the food. I overheard that my confinement was due to the power of “allergies.” I must learn what this means, and how to use it to my advantage.     Today I was almost successful in an attempt to assassinate one of my tormentors by weaving around his feet as he was walking. I must try this again tomorrow, but at the top of the stairs.     I am convinced that the other prisoners here are flunkies and snitches. The dog receives special privileges. He is regularly released, and seems to be more than willing to return. He is obviously retarded. The bird must be an informant. I observe him communicate with the guards regularly. I am certain that he reports my every move. My captors have arranged protective custody for him in an elevated cell, so he is safe.   For now ...

1	TIL that McDonald's and police use the same training material. It's a 5 step de-escalation procedure. You know, a kind that some corporate HR would come up. Ones with corny, forced acronyms. But this one actually works pretty well:  1. Believe 2. Listen 3. Apologize 4. Satisfy 5. Thank the customer  So when a customer gets all pissy about missing patties in their burger or fries missing potato, you just use this 5 step technique. Fast food workers are really good about clearing out angry customers because they need to keep the drive-thru lines moving.  Upon seeing the effectiveness of this technique the city's local police decided to adopt it. But they couldn't go through all the training material due to budget constraints (they spent it all on armor-plated patrol cars with 20mm canons). So they taught the officers the acronyms, but couldn't get into all the nitty gritty details of what each of the letters meant. So now officers are out on the street, and whenever they see any sign of confrontation they BLAST. No one ever complains once they've been BLASTed.

But before I allow you into heaven I need you to answer one final essay question. In 50 words or less, can you tell me the true meaning of Easter?"  The first man scratches his head, "Well, you cut down a tree, decorate it. Put presents underneath - boom! You got Easter!"  St. Peter looks at him sternly. "No. That's Christmas." Poof! He's disappears and reappears in Hell, to burn for all eternity.  St. Peter goes to the second man. "Please tell me the true meaning of Easter in 50 words or less."  The second man concentrates and thinks hard. "Uhhh, That's when you get the family together, eat the Turkey and watch the big game?"  St. Peter replies, "Are you talking about Thanksgiving?" "Yeah! Yeah, Thanksgiving for Easter!", replies the second man. "That's not even a religious holiday, you asshole!", says St. Peter. The second man disappears and reappears in Hell to burn for all Eternity.  Annoyed, St. Peter sternly asks the third man, "True meaning of Easter - 50 words or less. Let's go!"  The third man smiles. "I apologize for those other two guys. They are clearly not very pious. The Lord God sent his only son, Jesus Christ to earth to be crucified for our sins. Christ was removed from the cross and placed into a tomb. After three days, the stone was removed from the entrance of the tomb and Christ emerged. ... and if he sees his own shadow there are six more weeks of winter."

His cellmate helpfully suggests if he has any questions he can just ask.     A month later, he says, "You know, I think I have the basic feel for the place, people to avoid, the guards, and all that.  But it's still baffling."  His cellie says, "What's that?"     "Well, you know how sometimes at dinner, people will stand up and shout out a random number?  Okay, that's weird enough.  But what's weirder is people's reactions.  Sometimes they'll chuckle a little, or they'll just groan, or they'll laugh like crazy.  What is that all about?"     Cellie smiles and says, "Oh that's easy.  So most of us are in here for the long haul, and we still like jokes, but after a few years we've heard them all a bunch of time.  So we wrote our favorites up in a book with numbers, and to save the time of telling, we just tell the number."     The newbie is all enthusiastic and begs for a copy of the book, so for a pack of cigarettes the cellie promises to get him a loaner copy.  The guy busily works at memorizing all the best jokes, and next week he decides to try it out.     That evening after people are mostly done eating he steels himself, gets up and shouts out, "Sixty six."  But nobody laughs.  He thinks to himself, okay, that one was good, but maybe it wasn't the best.  He decides to try again and says, "Hundred and fifty!"  But nobody's laughing still.  He's puzzled, so in desperation he pulls out the best in the book:  "Twenty-nine!"  Silence.     Realizing he's just made a small fool of himself, he sits down and finishes dinner.  Ten minutes later he's back on the bunk staring at the walls puzzled.  He says to his cellie, "I don't get it.  I don't get it.  I told three of the best jokes in that whole book, and nobody so much as  cracked a smile!  It makes no sense.  What the hell just happened back there?"     The cellmate leans back for a second and says, "Well, you know how it is . . . .  Some guys can tell a joke; some guys can't."

2	The Three Babies An Englishman, Welshman and a Jamaican are in hospital waiting for their wives to give birth. After much pacing up and down, the nurse emerges from the maternity ward and announces that each are the father to a bouncing baby boy.  “Unfortunately there’s just one small problem” she adds. “Because they were all born at the same time we got the tags mixed up and don’t know which baby belongs to which parent. Would you mind identifying them?”. The three men agree and go into the delivery room to look at the babies. Immediately the Englishman picks up the black baby. “Yes, this is definitely my baby” he says confidently.  “Er, excuse me” says the Jamaican “but I think it’s obvious that this is my son.”  The Englishman pulls him aside and says, “I see where you’re coming from, mate, but one of these babies is Welsh and I’m not prepared to gamble”.

2	Two boys in Egypt free a crocodile...  In a small village in Egypt lived two orphan boys, Set and Amenhotep. They always watched out for each other, well past their years of childhood and into their time as young adults.     One day, the two were walking outside the village when they saw a crocodile trapped in a poacher’s snare. The two young men, sympathetic to a creature in need, approached the crocodile and released it from the trap.     Once freed, the crocodile transformed into a wispy, glowing fairy! “Thank you, young men” said the fairy, “Your hearts are truly selfless, and I will grant each of you one wish. What are your names?”     “This is my friend Set, and you can call me ‘Ep’”, said Amenhotep.     “Very well, Ep” said the fairy “What is the desire of your heart?”     “I wish I was the strongest man in the world!” Amenhotep wished.     “Very well”, said the fairy, “but you must always use your strength to help others.” Smoke gathered around Amenhotep, and when the smoke cleared Ep was 7 foot six and rippling with muscles.     The fairy turned to Set “And what is your wish, Set?”   Set responded “I never want to be poor again! I wish for money!”     “Very well,” said the fairy. Smoke gathered in front of the two of them, and when the smoke cleared a small elf remained, bowing to the two boys. “Greetings, sirs! My name is Elmon, and I am here to serve!”     “Elmon is an expert in all things money,” said the fairy, “He will help you make wise decisions and turn any business profitable, but will only help you so long as he is only asked to do good for your fellow man.”     Amenhotep and Set were inseparable. True to his word, Amenhotep used his great strength to build many houses for people in need. Set helped, as well, but his comparatively small size next to the now massive Amenhotep earned him the nickname “Imp”. With Elmon’s financial savvy, the two started a non-profit dedicated to building houses for the less fortunate, and Elmon kept all their paperwork in perfect order.     Years passed, and the two lived very fulfilling lives helping the homeless. Amenhotep met a girl while building houses and the two got married and had a beautiful baby boy, Josep.     Ep and Set’s business expanded globally. 15 years passed and Amenhotep grew kinder and more generous, giving to people in need at any of the places he went to build houses. Set built a campus in Cairo for the headquarters of their business, and directed global efforts. Over the years, Set lost touch with the people he was helping, and became more focused on business expansion and money of the business.     As all fathers do, Amenhotep wanted his son to eventually take over the business and help the next generation of needful people find purpose in their lives. He sent Josep to the the HQ in Cairo to learn business from Set. Once there, Josep was surprised to find that much of the financial success was due in large part to the financial savvy of Elmon, the elf.     Josep spent months at HQ learning how to run the business. While there, Set decided that it was time to expand the company into a more profitable venture. Instead of building houses for the needy, he drafted up a plan to buy up land around urban areas and construct rental properties at expensive prices while preventing construction of new, affordable housing. He sent Josep with the proposal to Elmon to determine the financial logistics.     Upon reading the proposal and its ill-nature’s effect on Set’s fellow man, Elmon keeled over and died, instantly.     Josep was shocked, and ran to alert Set right away, who wailed in dismay at the loss of his financial mastermind. In a rage, he accused Josep of killing Elmon, and sent the teenager to jail.     Amenhotep, hearing of the distress, caught the first flight back to Cairo to find himself neck-deep in a legal battle between him and his old friend.     Without the financial and legal savvy of Elmon, Set’s case was a mess. Amenhotep, distraught, tried to reason with his childhood friend. “Come, Imp, release my boy and call off the lawsuit. Let’s use our energy to help those in need and not further what we both know is a fruitless path.”     Set refused, furiously gathering circumstantial evidence to bring to the court to frame Josep for Elmon’s murder.     The case was brought before the court, but Set’s claims were weak and unsupported. The judge, thoroughly disgusted with the lack of evidence from the prosecution, dismissed the case outright.     Obviously, Ep’s teen didn’t kill Imp’s elf.

1	A world champion in grizzly bear hunting wanted to shoot a polar one He's got yet another prize in USA for hunting grizzlies, proving he's the best there is. Doesn't matter how hard it would be to hunt one, he would track them and hunt them.  One day he wanted the challenge, and thought he would step up his game and hunt for polar bears. He's no expert in polar bears, but for sure some things are the same, right? Grizzly bears and polar bears are bears after all. So he went to Russia, Siberia to be precise. No knowing where to find information about hunting a polar bear, he entered the local's inn and proudly announced: "I am the world champion in grizzly bear hunting! I want to hunt a polar bear though, is there anyone brave anough to help me?"  With all eyes on him the inn went silent for several seconds, until a big, muscular man, wearing animals leather on his shoulders got up and said: "My name is Ivan, this is my dog Charlie, we will help you."  Our guy were a little scared of him (russian guy was massive), but didn't ask question and they later just went for the hunt.  While in the woods (white everywhere, snow everywhere) they were marching in silence, with Ivan and dog Charlie on the front. Suddenly, the russian stops and says:  "Ok look. On top of this tree, look" (he points at the tree) "There is a polar bear. Here, take this shotgun." (He then gives the American the shotgun, which he takes no questions asked). "The plan is as follows: I climb up the tree, throw off the polar bear to the ground and my dog Charlie fucks him to death."  "Okaaaay, but then why did u give me the gun?"  "If I get down first, shoot the dog."

4	Not having sex tonight One evening last week，my girlfriend and I were getting into bed. Well，the passion starts to heat up，and she eventually says，‘I don‘t feel like it，I just want you to hold me.‘  I said，‘WHAT??!! What was that?!‘  So she says the words that every boyfriend on the planet dreads to hear....   ‘You are just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.‘   She responded to my puzzled look by saying，‘Can‘t you just love me for who I am and not what I do for you in the bedroom?‘   Realizing that nothing was going to happen that night，I went to sleep.   The very next day I opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. We went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big，big unnamed department store. I walked around with her while she tried on several different very expensive outfits. She couldn‘t decide which one to take，so I told her we‘d just buy them all. She wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes，so I said，‘Lets get a pair for each outfit.‘   We went on to the  jewelry department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings. Let me tell you... she was so excited. She must have thought I was one wave short of a shipwreck. I started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn‘t even know how to play tennis.   I think I threw her for a loop when I said，‘That‘s fine，honey.‘ She was almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. Smiling with excited anticipation，she finally said，‘I think this is all dear，let‘s go to the cashier.‘   I could hardly contain myself when I blurted out，‘No honey，I don‘t feel like it.‘  Her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled，‘WHAT?‘   I then said，‘Honey! I just want you to HOLD this stuff for a while. You are just not in touch with my financial needs as a man enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.‘   And just when she had this look like she was going to kill me，I added，‘Why can‘t you just love me for who I am and not for the things I buy you?‘   Apparently I am not having sex tonight.

1	Breakfast for the Mailman It was George the Mailman’s last day on the job after 35 years of carrying the mail through all kinds of weather to the same neighborhood.  When he arrived at the first house on his route he was greeted by the whole family there, who roundly and soundly congratulated him and sent him on his way with a tidy gift envelope.  At the second house they presented him with a box of fine cigars. The folks at the third house handed him a selection of terrific fishing lures. At the fourth house he was met at the door by a strikingly beautiful woman in a revealing negligee. She took him by the hand, gently led him through the door (which she closed behind him), and led him up the stairs to the bedroom where she blew his mind with the most passionate love he had ever experienced.  When he had had enough they went downstairs, where she fixed him a giant breakfast: eggs, potatoes, ham, sausage, blueberry waffles, and fresh-squeezed orange juice. When he was truly satisfied she poured him a cup of steaming coffee. As she was pouring, he noticed a dollar bill sticking out from under the cup’s bottom edge. "All this was just too wonderful for words, " he said, "but what’s the dollar for?"  "Well," she said, "last night, I told my husband that today would be your last day, and that we should do something special for you. I asked him what to give you.  He said, "Fuck him. Give him a dollar." The breakfast ... that was my idea."

1	THE COFFIN A man is walking home alone late one foggy Halloween night, when behind him he hears:  BUMP... BUMP... BUMP...  Walking faster, he looks back and through the fog he makes out the image of an upright casket banging its way down the middle of the street toward him.   BUMP... BUMP... BUMP...   Terrified, the man begins to run toward his home, the casket bouncing quickly behind him.  FASTER... FASTER... BUMP... BUMP... BUMP....  He runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him. However, the casket crashes through his door, with the lid of the casket clapping.   clappity-BUMP...clappity-BUMP... clappity-BUMP...  on his heels, as the terrified man runs.   Rushing upstairs to the bathroom, he locks himself in. His heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.   With a loud CRASH the casket breaks down the door.  Bumping and clapping toward him.  The man screams and reaches for something, anything...  All he can find is a box of cough drops! Desperate, he throws the cough drops at the coffin ...  . . .  ...the coffin stops!

1	Two men from Texas were in Canada for winter break. At their cabin they met two canadians. The day after they decided they had to get food, so naturaly they decided to go ice fishing. To make it a bit more fun, the two guys from Texas decided to show the canadians how great America was, by beating them in an ice fishing competition. The canadians accapted the challange. The team with the most fish after two hours would win.  After about an hour the Canadians had gotten several fish, big and small, while the guys from Texas had not gotten a single bite. They decided if they were going to win, they had to start stealing the canadians strategy. The Americans retreated back to observe, and try figure out what the Canadians were doing differently. After 15 minutes of puzzling and observing, one of the Texan's said "Gosh Darnit! The Canadians are cheating! They made a hole in the ice!"

Even celebrities." The interviewer played along and asked, "Alright. How about Tom Cruise?". Kevin chuckles and says, "Yep! Tom and I go way back actually". Figuring Kevin was just trying to look impressive, he prods him further. "Let's just go over to his house then! It's only an hour away". So they both arrive to Tom Cruise's fence and speak into the intercom at the gate. "Heya Tom! It's your old pal Kevin." The interviewer is shocked the gate opens and Tom Cruise comes out to greet and hug Kevin. They chat for awhile and finally leave. The interviewer says "OK. That was pretty cool. And also pure luck. How about... Barack Obama?". Kevin nods and says "Yep. Sure do. Barack and I go way back". Refusing to believe it could happen again, they find out Barack is nearby and head to his location. After getting screened and patted down by security, the interviewer and Kevin see Obama walking toward them with a grin and Obama says, "Kevin! It's been forever!". The interviewer can't believe it as the three of them have a conversation over cigars. After leaving, the interviewer says, "Alright. That's it.

Kevin yells but can't get his attention so he tells the interviewer he'll go to him. The interviewer thinking this is all poppycock watches from below. After making his way up and through security, the Pope sees him and exclaims, "Kevin my dear boy! Come out here." Kevin heads out onto the platform with the Pope and looks for the interviewer but can't seem to find him in the crowd. Kevin heads back down there and searches but notices an ambulance nearby. As he gets closer, he sees his interviewer sitting on the bumper with an oxygen mask to his face. Kevin says, "What happened?! Are you OK?". The interviewer explained, "I was fine until someone next to me said something and my brain couldn't take it anymore. I feinted and collapsed." Kevin asks, "What did they say?". The interviewer said, "You were out there on the balcony and some guy said: "Who's that guy up there with Kevin?"

2	Donald Trump has just died. He goes to Hell where the Devil is waiting for him. "I don't know what to do," says the Devil. "You're on my list but I have no room for you. But you definitely have to stay here, so I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I've got three people here who weren't quite as bad as you. I'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. I'll even let YOU decide who leaves."   Trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.    The devil opened the first room. In it was Richard Nixon and a large pool of water. He kept diving in and surfacing empty handed over and over and over, such was his fate in Hell.  "No!" Trump said. "I don't think so. I'm not a good swimmer and I don't think I could do that all day long."    The Devil led him to the next room. In it was Tony Blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. All he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time.  "No! I've got this problem with my shoulder. I would be in constant agony if all I could do was break rocks all day!" commented Trump.     The Devil opened a third door. In it, Trump saw Bill Clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky, doing what she does best.    Trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this."    The Devil smiled and said, "Monica, you're free to go!"

2	The Excuse  This past fall semester, at Duke University, there were two sophomores who were taking Organic Chemistry and who did pretty well on all of the quizzes, midterms, labs, etc. Going into the final exam, they had solid "A's."  These two friends were so confident going into the final that the weekend before finals week (even though the Chem. final was on Monday), they decided to go up to University of Virginia to a party with some friends.  So they did this and had a great time. However, they ended up staying longer than they planned, and they didn't make it back to Duke until early Monday morning. Rather than taking the final then, they found Professor Aldric after the final and explained to him why they missed it. They told him that they went up to Virginia for the weekend, and had planned to come back in time to study, but that they had a flat tire on the way back and didn't have a spare and couldn't get help for a long time. So they were late getting back to campus.  Aldric thought this over and agreed that they could make up the final on the following day. The two guys were elated and relieved. So, they studied that night and went in the next day at the time that Aldric had told them.  He placed them in separate rooms, handed each of them a test booklet and told them to begin. They looked at the first problem, which was something simple about free radical formation and was worth 5 points. "Cool" they thought, "this is going to be easy." They did that problem and then turned the page.  They were unprepared, however, for what they saw on the next page.  It said: (95 points) "Which tire?"

The leprechaun winks and says, "Well, you have to let me bugger ya good."  Taken aback the guy says, "I dunno. I'm not gay. I've never done that...."  The leprechaun says, "Relax! Nobody will ever know and since it's your first time, I'll be gentle. And just think. You'll be hung to your knees!"  The guy kicks it around before finally giving in. Back in the stall, the leprechaun starts ass raping him and making conversation.  "What's your name friend?" he asks.  Trying to think through the pain he says, "James. Name is James."  "Aye! Good strong Christian name that is! Do they call you Jim? Jimmy? James?"  "Ummm...fuck that hurts....mostly Jim..."  "Then Jim it tis! Tell me Jim, are ye married?"

She replays "now I see... listen to me darling, he pays 20 € because he is a loyal customer! But he can't send all his friend here expecting me to make discount for everyone! "   P. S.

2	A man and a chicken walk into a small restaurant A man and a chicken walk into a small restaurant, they sit down, and the waitress takes their order, the man says "I'll have a number 5 with a large coffee", and the chicken says "I will have that as well". When they finished their meal, the man walks up to the counter to pay, and he reaches into his pocket and pulls out exactly how much money he needed with exact change, and he and the chicken went on their way.  The next day, there was a blizzard and the roads were incredibly dangerous, however, the man and the chicken still arrived all the same. This time, the man said "I'll take a number 12 with a medium orange juice" and the chicken said "I will have that as well". When they finished eating, the man went to pay, and once again pulled out exact change, and he and the chicken went on their way.  This continued for about a month, no matter how bad the weather, no matter how many roads were closed, the man and the chicken came in, he ordered, the chicken ordered the same, he paid with exact change out of his pocket, and they left.  Eventually, the waitress' curiosity got the best of her, and as the man was paying, she asked, "How are you able to give exact change so easily?" and the man answered with "Well, about a year ago, I found an old oil burning lamp, so I rubbed it, and a genie came out and told me I could make three wishes, but I also had to be quite specific, or I could end up with something I didn't want. So I told him, for my first wish, I want to always have however much money I need to buy whatever I want in my pocket, with exact change." The waitress said "Wow that's very smart of you! Normally people would ask for a million dollars, but then would be out of money once it's all spent. However, this way you always have as much money as you need without running out!"  So the man continued, "For my second wish, I want for my truck to always reach my destination, no matter how slick, rocky, or overall dangerous the terrain." the waitress said "Woah, that's very smart as well! But what about the chicken?"  The man answered "Ah, I slipped up, I said I wanted a cute chick who follows me wherever I go, and agrees with everything I say..."
5	Depressing pickup lines. Are you suicide? Because I think about you every day.   Are you a toaster? Because I really want to take a bath with you.   Are you a noose? Because I really want to hang with you.  Are you a gravestone? Because I really wish you were on top of me.   Are you anti-depressants? Because if I don’t have you every day I’m going to kill myself.   Are you a coffin? Because I really wish I was inside you right now.   Are you a coroner? Because I really want you to inspect my body.   Are you a death certificate? Because I really wish you were mine.   Are you an electrical outlet? Because I really want to stick my fingers in you.

All of the jokes that I made up myself were made in good spirits. Thank you though for all the support and messages.   3. Thank you all for contributing to the jokes. Honestly, the main reaction I wanted was people to start posting more of these. I sort of stumbled though the comments half awake but my favorites I remember were:  Are you death? Because I long for your sweet embrace.   Are you the suicide hotline? Because I really need to get your number.   Are you a hand grenade? Because I really want to lay down on you.  Are you an exhaust pipe? Because I really want to suck on you.   Are you a gun? Because I really want to put you in my mouth.   THANK YOU TO EVERYONE. THIS MADE MY DAY.

I was instructed to take my time and report on all the street activities. So, one Sunday I began my commentary as my parents put their devious plan into action. 'An ambulance just drove past' 'Looks like the Andersons have visitors,' I called out. 'Tommy’s got a new bike!' 'Looks like the Brown’s are moving!' 'Little Terry is on his toy car! Then, after a pause I announced, 'Mr and Mrs Cooper are having sex. Startled, Mum and Dad shot up in bed! Daddy cautiously called out, 'How do you know that, son?' 'Jimmy Cooper's standing on his balcony with a Choc ice and a Mars Bar.'

1	A police station was about to be defunded because they could never solve a single crime. A police station was about to be defunded because they could never solve a single crime.   The police chief in desperation hired a quality assurance officer to check what was wrong.   The QA officer proposed that if the chief’s detectives can solve all murders committed by him, then he will write a blazing report to the commissioner and save all their jobs. The chief accepted.   A few weeks went by and murder after murder was successfully solved and lead back to the QA officer. The chief was happy and the report was ready to be sent to the commissioner showing all their solved cases.   One day, chief got a call that he and all the officers were fired because the QA officer had recommended the station to be shut down.   Enraged the police chief yelled at the QA officer saying, “We passed your test! I expected a great report!” The QA office said, “Yes, you solved the murders but you seem to have a hole in your hiring practices. I am a serial killer.”

The mechanic says it’ll take a few hours to repair, so the penguin, exasperated, goes to look around the town.  He goes into a clothing store and buys a nice shirt, and goes to a book store and buys some nice books. However, the penguin, being in Florida, decides to get some ice cream to cool himself down.   He finds a nice ice cream shop and orders a large vanilla cone, and enjoys it. However, he is a messy eater, and there is vanilla ice cream all over his face.   It’s been several hours at this point, so the penguin goes back to the mechanic to check on his car.   The mechanic, still working on the car, looks up at the penguin, and says, “It looks like you’ve blown a seal.”  The penguin replies, “Oh no, it’s just ice cream.”

2	Bob came home drunk one night, slid into bed beside his sleeping wife, and fell into a deep slumber. He awoke before the Pearly Gates, where St. Peter said, 'You died in your sleep, Bob....' Bob was stunned. 'I'm dead? No, I can't be! I've got too much to live for. Send me back!' St. Peter said, 'I'm sorry, but there's only one way you can go back, and that is as a chicken.' Bob was devastated, but begged St. Peter to send him to a farm near his home.... The next thing he knew, he was covered with feathers, clucking, and pecking the ground. A rooster strolled past. 'So, you're the new hen, huh? How's your first day here?' 'Not bad,' replied Bob the hen, 'but I have this strange feeling inside. Like I'm gonna explode!' 'You're ovulating,' explained the rooster. Don't tell me you've never laid an egg before? ' 'Never,' said Bob. 'Well, just relax and let it happen,' says the rooster. 'It's no big deal.' Bob did, and a few uncomfortable seconds later, out popped an egg! Bob was overcome with emotion as he experienced motherhood. He soon laid another egg -- his joy was overwhelming. As he was about to lay his third egg, he felt a smack on the back of his head, and heard his wife yell..... 'BOB, wake up....... You've shit the bed!
1	Wanna hear a dead baby joke I just made up? Sorry, there are problems with the delivery.
1	I made a (hopefully) original joke! In 2019, the army had been at war with another country. In order to keep their troops healthy, they needed to monitor the submarine that carried supplies to where the others were located.  But there was a small problem. Every so often, there would be a defect in the submarine's engine that would cause it to shut down. These defects were manageable at first, but they slowly became so severe that the crew had no choice but to get several ships to surround the submarine and make sure it was functioning properly.  Each ship had a small selection of sailors posted on the end of the ship, and their jobs were to watch the submarine for any problems. If they found any, they were to report to the aiding crew that would repair the ship's engine and keep it alive.  But there was a problem. Despite sailors being required to sit around and do nothing all day, they were hardly being paid. And this inspired a strike! The sailors eventually all abandoned their posts, meaning there was nobody watching over the submarine.  The military leader was confused by the complaints he was hearing and decided to investigate for himself. He went on the security cameras and went to ship 1, but nobody was there.  He checked ship 2, and nobody was there.  He checked ship 3, and nobody was there!  Panicking, the leader called the ship's aiding crew and screamed "Is this sub still active?! I haven't seen any posts since last deck, Aid!"

The man thinks long and hard and declares "I want to live a long and healthy life."  The genie immediately scans the man's body, eliminating all possible cancer cells and cures him of all preexisting conditions.  "I have cured you of all issues, and you will like a long and healthy life" the genie proclaims. "What is your second wish?" the genie asks.  "I want to be rich and never worry about money" the man says.  The genie looks up the man's bank account and adds 000,000,000 after the current balance. The genie says "you are now rich and will never have to worry about money again. What is your final wish?"  The man pauses and says "I want a bridge linking California to Hawaii."  The genie is taken aback, commenting "What? Do you have any idea home complicated that is? I have to get permits to build in international waters, ensure I don't block major trade routes, put gas stations and restaurants along the way with people to work them, billions of tons of concrete, not to mention a method to protect the road from natural disasters and about a million other logistical nightmares. That's way too complex. Please wish for something else. "  The man, feeling stupid from the genie's scolding says "ok I'm sorry I'll come up with a new wish."  After deliberation the man says "Ok for my last wish I want to understand women."  The genie looks at the man, sighs and says "do you want 2 lanes or 4?"

1	A duck gets in trouble for blowing bubbles in the pond. A flock of ducks are in a pond. One day, a particular duck, whom we’ll call Quack, found himself upset over seeing another duck blowing bubbles in the pond. So upset, in fact, he decides to take the duck (whose name was Waddle) to court.   Once in court, the duck is is called to the duck stand. “State your name.”  “My name is Waddle.” “Waddle, what are you being accused of?” The judge asks the duck. “Heck if I knew!” He said. “I was just blowing bubbles in the pond!” The judge looked over his glasses at Quack, then back at Waddle. “I see no problem with blowing bubbles. You’re free to go,” he says.  The next day, Quack sees Waddle once again blowing bubbles in the pond, and became very angry. He decides once again (to the judge’s annoyance) to take Waddle to court, and they go through the same process. The judge begins to get very angry with Quack for continuing to bring Waddle in.  Finally, after weeks of trouble between Waddle and Quack, Quack takes Waddle to court one last time, and this time, he has a plan. “And I assume you’re here because Waddle was blowing bubbles in the pond,” the judge says to Quack in a dry tone. “Yes, your honor. But this time, I brought a witness!”  The judge calls the witness to the stand. “And your name, sir?”  “My name is Bubbles.”

After a long life together, the husband was the first to die. True to his word, he made the first contact. “Judy, Judy.”  “Is that you, George?"  "Yes, I've come back like we agreed."  "That's wonderful!? What's it like?"   “Well, I get up in the morning, I have sex. I have breakfast and then it's off to the golf course. I have sex again, bathe in the warm sun and then have sex a couple of more times. Then I have lunch, you'd be proud, lots of greens. Another romp around the golf course, then pretty much have sex the rest of the afternoon. After supper, it's back to golf course again. Then it's more sex until late at night. I catch some much-needed sleep and then the next day it starts all over again.”   “Oh, George, are you in Heaven?"  "No, I'm a rabbit in Kansas."

The wake, food and drinks were another $500. The rest went for the memorial stone."   Jody computed quickly. "$22,500 for a memorial stone? My God, how big is it?!"      "Two and a half carats."

1	NSFW an old one told to me long ago A woman walks into an small cantina and sees a live frog sitting on the shelf. She proceeds to ask the bartender "what's up with the frog?"  Bartender replies: "That there frog is guaranteed to get any woman off"  The woman laughs it off  Time goes by, a few drinks later she asks...  Woman: "Ok, I have to know. What is the secret of the frog?"  Bartender: "It's must be kept a secret, but I'll let you take him home for $100. Guaranteed satisfaction."  The woman laughs and orders another drink, but she can't stop thinking about the frog.  W: "Barkeep, if you stand by your guarantee, I'll take the frog home tonight."  Bartender assures the woman his word is gold. And "rents out" the frog.  Next evening the woman returns  W: "I want my money back! You lied!"  BT: "I assure you ma'am, I am not lying. Let me see him, I will have a talk with him and sort this out."  The bartender takes the frog into the back room. There is a small ruckus and he busts back threw the door, frog in hand.  BT: "I spoke to the frog. Surely give him one more chance. Take him home tonight, if it doesn't work out I promise I will I return your money, and... the next round is on me."  The woman is unsure, but the barkeep persuades her and she takes him home once again.  The next day, this woman is pissed. She storms in the bar, demanding a refund. The bartender is sincere and acting confused. He begins to explain...  BT: "let me see that frog."  The woman hands over the frog and he heads into the back room again. Some banging of pots and pans is followed by the bartender loudly exclaiming "I'm only going to show you this one more time!" As he slams the door returning to the bar.  BT: "Ma'am, Im gonna need you come on back here with me for a moment..."

Man: "She was so stupid, I just had to kill her." Judge: "That is even worse. If you don't want to be declared guilty on the spot, you better give us a plausible reason." Man: Well it happened like this. We live in this apartment complex and the property manager lives in the first floor with his family. The kids all have a growth deficiency. So one day, my wife comes up and says: Those little kids, they look like pyrenees. So I say: You mean pygmy. "No", says my wife. Pygmy is what you have under your skin, it causes freckles. "That's pigment", I say. So she says "No, pigment is what the ancient Romans were writing on." I sigh and say: "No, that's parchment!". "No", says she, "parchment is an unfinished sentence". "Your honor, you can imagine, I swallowed the 'fragment', I got back to my armchair and my newspaper. But then suddenly she's back with a book, and she says:  I should know, I got a legionnaire for my french lessons. I say: "You mean a lector". "No", says my wife, "Lector was an ancient Greek hero." I say: "That was Hector, and he was a Trojan." "Nope", says she, "Hector is a measure of area." "That'd be hectare" "No! Hectare is the drink of the gods!" "That'd be nectar". "No", says she, "the Nectar is a river in southern Germany." So I say: "That's the Neckar." She says: "No, I must know, there's even a song about it. I recently sung it in a duo with my friend" I say: "It's a duet" She replies, "No, that's when two men are fighting with a saber." "That's a duel", I say. "No, a duel is where a railway goes through a mountain!" Well, your honor, so I took a hammer and beat her to death... There was a long silence, shocked faces.  Finally the judge says: Not guilty. I would have killed her at "Hector".

He’s more surprised when, 10 minutes later, the same guy walks back into the bar and sits down next to him.  The astonished onlooker asks, “How did you do that? I just saw you jump out the window, and we’re hundreds of feet above the ground!”  The jumper responds by slurring, “Well, I don’t get it either. I slam a shot of tequila, and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.” He takes a shot, goes to the window and jumps out.  The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls to just above the sidewalk, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.  The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window. As he reaches the bottom, he doesn’t slow down at all. SPLAT!  The first guy orders another shot of tequila. The bartender shakes his head. “You’re really an a**hole when you’re drunk, Superman.”

Having never been in a helicopter in all his years, Bill begged Helen to let them ride. She refused, quipping "50 bucks is 50 bucks."   The following year, the man was there again, and again Bill begged for a ride. Again Helen turned it down, saying "50 bucks is 50 bucks."  The third year the same exact conversation happened, except this time the pilot overheard. He offered the couple a free ride, but with one condition. They must not make a sound while in the air, or they would have to pay the 50 dollars. Bill and Helen agreed and climbed aboard.  As soon as they left the ground, the pilot began performing hair raising maneuvers in the air, but try as he might, he could not get the couple to utter a sound. When they finally touched down, the pilot turned to Bill and exclaimed, "that was an  amazing show of self control, you have earned your free ride".  Bill replied, "well, I nearly said something when Helen fell out, but 50 bucks is 50 bucks."   Edit: spelling

1	A medieval king was hunting in Africa A medieval king was hunting in Africa. He killed a lion, an elephant, and a hippopotamus, and awarded the skins to his three squires back home in his kingdom.

As the years passed, the Lion Squire and the Elephant Squire became very jealous of the Hippo Squire because they wanted the hippo skin too.

The Lion Squire and the Elephant Squire sent there eighteen sons to kill the Hippo Squire, but the Hippo Squire drew his sword and single-handedly slaughtered all eighteen of them.

In order to do this the zebra decides to hold a competition in which animals will have to compete in front of a judge. Whoever the first one to makemake the judge laugh wins and will perform for the lion.  So the first thing the zebra does is look for the most serious animal. He walks up to a tortoise and asks, “Hey tortoise, I’m holding a competition and all you have to do is sit there and laugh if you find an animal to be funny. Will you do it?”  The tortoise responds, “...Yes.”  The day of the competition arrives and all The animals have gathered to compete. Since this is for the lion, the zebra decides to raise the stakes to ensure every animal delivers their full potential. He says, “Animals, your goal is to make the tortoise laugh. If you are able to do so, you win and get to perform for the lion. If you fail to make the tortoise laugh, then you will be killed and become the lion’s meal.”  The competition begins and up first is the monkey. He jumps from tree to tree, does flips, and makes funny noises. The zebra becomes pleased and looks at the tortoise and asks what he thinks, to which the tortoise says, “...” Since there is no reaction from the judge, the monkey is killed.  Up next is the ostrich. He runs around in circles and is moving his long neck. He jumps and does funny moves. The zebra is once again pleased and turns to see the reaction of the tortoise, which once again is, “...” So there’s nothing the zebra can do and they have the ostrich killed.  This pattern goes on with many of the funniest animals and the zebra becomes worried that they won’t have someone for the lion’s party. All of a sudden the next animal approaches, the hippopotamus. The zebra knows that he won’t be able to perform any fun tricks and just as he’s about to have him killed, he hears a chuckle from the tortoise. That chuckle turns into full blown roars of laughter. The zebra is bewildered and asks the tortoise, “Hey what’s so funny? He hasn’t done anything! He is literally just standing there!”   The tortoise responds, “HAHA, wow that monkey was hilarious!”

My teacher asked students what their favorite animal was and when it was my turn I said “Pink Flamingo”  The teacher began screaming and sent me to the principals office. “Why are you here son”, he asked.

What does a Pink Flamingo have to do with anything?” He said. “I have no idea, everyone’s always hated me for it though.” The police officer went across the street to the library to find an answer.  After hours and hours of research, the police officer finds the answer. Excited to tell me, he runs across the street. A car comes out of nowhere and kills him.  Moral of the story is, look both ways before you cross the street.

He’s gonna be released at the end of the spring however, and just wanted me to know in case I go to see any movies there soon.  “Well what’s he gonna do whoever he gets out of jail?” I ask him. He then puts a hand on my shoulder and says   “Coming this summer to a theater near you.”  (I’m sorry if this is bad I thought of it at 2 AM and couldn’t get it out of my head)

5	A good (and very old) joke to explain why people are stocking up on necessities It was autumn, and the Indians on the remote reservation asked their new Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets.  When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.  Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, "Is the coming winter going to be cold?"  "It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed," the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.  A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. "Is it going to be a very cold winter?"  "Yes," the man at National Weather Service again replied,"it's definitely going to be a very cold winter." The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.  Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. "Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?"  "Absolutely," the man replied. "It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever."  "How can you be so sure?" the Chief asked.  The weatherman replied, "The Indians are collecting wood like crazy."  EDIT: formatting...

2	Bored at work so I wrote my first joke. It’s extremely dumb but maybe it’ll make someone laugh. An extremely wealthy family owned countless successful companies, bought out competitors and even purchased new ventures if they looked promising enough. Nothing was too big or small, and nothing was off limits.  The family consisted of a mother (Linda), father (Robert) and 3 sons (Robert Jr., Louis & Clarence). Robert Jr. and Louis were in their late twenties and intelligent beyond their years. They were primed to lead the family when the time came. Clarence wasn’t as smart or successful as his older brothers, but he strived to prove everyone wrong. He wanted to help lead this family into the future alongside his brothers.  Linda and Robert tasked the three brothers with purchasing three more companies to put under the family umbrella. They each had a budget of $50 million and set out on their own paths to make their parents proud. They were given 7 days to acquire their respective businesses.  Clarence ran out of the room as fast as he could, jumped in his Porsche and took off. He already had a place in mind. He heard about a massive new Waste Disposal company that just moved into town last year. They were known for their environmentally friendly practices and the company was already  profitable. It was perfect.  After 7 days, a family meeting was held where each of the brothers were to present and introduce their newest acquisitions. Robert Jr. insisted he go first. He proudly stated, “Mother, father, I’ve taken an up-and-coming lumber yard, as you can see on my chest. It’s called Alpha Lumber.” He points to his left chest and shows off his new polo shirt with the Alpha Lumber logo beautifully showcased. Louis insisted he presented next, “Nicely done, brother,” he says, “but it’s not as promising as mine. Mother, father, I’ve taken a software and technology company, as you can see on my chest. It’s called GigaBite and is projected to rival Microsoft within the decade.” He points to his own chest, revealing the new GigaBite logo.  Clarence, eager to prove himself nearly cut his brother off so he could take the floor. He began,    “Mother, father, I’ve taken a massive dump, as you can see on my chest...”

The man smiles and says, "Never did I cheat on my beloved wife!"  St. Peter gives the man a pat and says, "Well done! You'll have a new Ferrari to drive around heaven. Welcome to the kingdom."  The men go through the gates, hop in their new cars and drive away. A few minutes later, the man in the Ferrari stops at an intersection, gets out of his car and starts crying. A few people approach to comfort him and ask, "What's wrong, sir? You have the nicest car in town!"  The man looks up through his tears and replies, "I just saw my wife on a skateboard."

2	A joke I made up 10yr ago on a road trip: What did the calendar say on its death bed My days are numbered
1	A salesman was driving the back roads one day, when he saw the strangest thing... While driving dusty back roads looking for his next sale, this Salesman noticed a chicken was running along side the road. Now, the guy didn't think much of that, you tend to see chickens in rural communities... but this one was strange. The chicken was keeping up with the car, even though the guy was driving at about forty miles per hour.  Curious what would happen, the guy sped up his car, pushing it to sixty... and the chicken kept up with him. Then, to his shock, the bird put on a burst of speed and passed him, before darting down this long gravel drive.  The salesman was seriously confused by this, and turned down the drive. At the end of it, he found a run down house, a run down barn, and no less than ten of those same chickens darting around. Stepping out of his car, he managed to get a close look at one and saw it had three legs.  As he stood there, the farmer came out and asked him if he could help the guy.   "Am I seeing things?" He asked the farmer.  "Three legged chickens? Naw, you ain't seein things." The farmer replied.  "How did that happen?" The salesman asked.  "Well, ya see," the farmer started. "I love drum sticks, my wife, she loves drum sticks, and our boy, he loves drum sticks. Problem is, with one chicken, there's never enough. Someone was always getting left out."    The salesman nodded at this, listening to the story intently.  "So," the farmer continued, "The neighbor down the way a spell, his boy is in college studying biology or something. I told him about that problem, and the boy said he could probably do something to make a chicken with more legs. So everyone got what they wanted."  "So..." the salesman asked, watching the chickens zoom around the yard.  "How do they taste?"  "Don't rightly know." The farmer replied. "Ain't managed to catch one of them to find out."

1	I ran over my neighbors cat this morning I was running late for work and as I’m rushing out of the house I backed up without checking my surroundings. To my surprise I felt a bump and heard a yelp.   I get out of my car and instantly recognized my neighbors cat — I felt terrible. Feeling it was the right thing to do, I went and grabbed my neighbor to tell her the bad news and she went absolutely ballistic. She was threatening me with a lawsuit and creating a scene in our neighborhood. After about 10 minutes of yelling, she ended up calling the cops.  The cops got there and she was insisting they charge me with anything they could. Thankfully for me they said there wasn’t much they could do because my city won’t charge someone for inadvertently killing an animal.   At that point my neighbor was furious and demanded she get some sort of justice. The cops asked her what she wanted and she said “we’ll I need at least $500”. I started to panic and really didn’t want to fork over $500 no matter how bad I felt.   I look over to the cops hoping that doesn’t have to happen and to my surprise the cops were putting my neighbor in handcuffs. At this point I just consider myself lucky and stopped talking while my neighbor is screaming and asking what they’re arresting her for.  Turns out you can’t charge anyone for your pussy.

Bent over him was Monica Lewinsky... doing what she does best.  Trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, "Yeah, I can handle this!”  The Devil smiled and said, "Monica, you're free to go!"

The soldier went sprawling, but rolled to his knees, pulled a 9mm pistol from under his flak jacket and shot the leader dead.

As the soldier was untying the reporters, they asked him "why didn't you just shoot them in the beginning? Why did you ask them to kick you in the butt first?"  "What?" replied the Israeli, "and have you report that I was the aggressor?"

2	Three men go on a hunting trip in the woods... They gather around the fire at dusk. They eat and drink and tell stories. Then slowly the fire goes down, and they finish their drinks. The men have no more stories to tell, and boredom starts to take over.   "ENOUGH!" Says the first man, standing up. "We should do something! I bet the two of you, I can go out in the woods and catch me a fox in less than an hour."   The other two looked at each other with disbelief, then back at the first man. "One hour? At night? To catch a fox? You're on!"   The first man grabs his flashlight and heads into the woods. In just over forty minutes, he returns with the remains of a fox.   "That's amazing!" the second man says. "How did you manage that?"   The first man replies, "It was simple, I looked for the tracks. When I found them, I followed them until I got the fox."  The second man stands up. "I can one up ya. I will go out an bring back a deer in less than two hours." He took the flashlight from the first man and left.   A hour and a half later, he come back into camp dragging a deer. "That's impressive," the third man said. "What's your secret?"  "Our friend here was right. I looked for the tracks. Once I found them, I followed them right to the deer."  "Well, I can't let you two have all the glory," the third man said. "I will go out too, and in three hours I will be bring back a bear." He grabbed the flashlight and left.  Three hours came and went. Soon after, the third man crawled back into camp. He was missing a foot, his clothes were mangled and bloody. All his exposed skin was torn to shreds.   The first man grabbed his phone to call 911. The second man ran to his friend's aid. "WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED!?"  "I looked for the tracks, I followed them, and that's when I saw the train."

Not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he paid her a large sum of money if she would go to Italy to have the child. If she stayed in Italy, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18. She agreed, but wondered how he would know when the baby was born. To keep it discrete, he told her to mail him a postcard, and write "Spaghetti" on the back. He would then arrange for child support. One day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife. "Honey," she said, "you received a very strange postcard today." "Oh, just give it to me and I'll explain it later," he said. The wife handed the card over and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted. On the card was written "Spaghetti, Spaghetti, Spaghetti. Two with meatballs, one without."

2	An Air Force Colonel is about to brief his men. An Air force Colonel is about to start the morning briefing.   While waiting for the coffee machine to finish brewing, the Colonel decides to pose a question to assembled staff.   He explained his wife had been a bit frisky the night before, and that he failed to get his usual amount of solid sleep.  He posed a question of how much sex was comprised of "work" verses "fun".  A Major chimed in that it was 75/25 in favor of work.   A Captain said 50-50.  A Lieutenant responded with 25/75 in favor of fun, depending on how inebriated he was at the time.   There being no consensus, the Colonel turned to the Airman First Class who was in charge of making the coffee and asked for his opinion.  Without any hesitation, the young AFC responded "Sir, it has to be 100% fun"  The Colonel was surprised, and as you might guess, he asked for an explanation.  "Well, sir, if there was any work involved in it, the officers would have all have me doing it for them".   The room fell silent.

3	Silence or Dishes    Joe wanted to buy a motorcycle.  He doesn't have much luck, until one day, he comes across a Harley with a FOR SALE sign on it.  The bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old.  It's shiny and in absolute mint condition.  He immediately buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.  "Well, it's quite simple really," says the seller, "whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub Vaseline on the chrome. It protects it from the rain." (true story)  And he hands Joe a jar of Vaseline.  That night, his girlfriend, Sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. Naturally, they take the bike there. But just before they enter the house, Sandra stops him and says, "I have to tell you something about my family before we go in."  "When we eat dinner, we don't talk.  In fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes."  "No problem," he says.. And in they go.  Joe is shocked. Right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.  In the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. Piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.  They sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.  As dinner progresses, Joe decides to take advantage of the situation.  So he leans over and kisses Sandra. No one says a word.  So he reaches over and fondles her breasts. Still, nobody says a word.  So he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her parents.  His girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.  He looks at her mom. "She's got a great body," he thinks.  So he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose right there on the dinner table.  After she has a big orgasm, he sits down again. Now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, the Mom is pleasantly beaming.  But still.... Total silence.  All of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.  Joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of Vaseline from his pocket.  Suddenly the father shouted, **"I'll do the fuckin dishes!!"**

Life was good, except that the prawns were constantly being chased and threatened by sharks. Finally one day, Justin said to Christian, "I'm tired of being a prawn. I wish I was a shark, then I wouldn't have to worry about being eaten."   Just then a mysterious cod appeared and said, "Your wish is granted," and lo and behold, Justin turned into a shark.

"Please change me back!" And lo and behold, the cod changed him back to a prawn. With tears of joy in his little eyes, Justin swam to Christian's house and knocked on the door. "It's me, Justin, your old friend! Come out and see me!" he shouted.   "No," said Christian. "I'll not be tricked. You're a shark and you will eat me!"   Justin cried back, "No, I'm not! That was the old me. I've changed. I've found Cod, I'm a prawn again Christian!"

2	WWII as a bar fight... I made a bar fight for WWI in honor of the 101 anniversary of its end, and someone requested one for the sequel. So here it is.  Germany went into a deep depression after his defeat in the last fight. His bar tab from his enemies' victory drink was crushing. He started hitting the gym, and wanted revenge. One day, he returns to the same bar. Britain, France, Russia (who changed his name to the USSR after his personality change), everyone. They all stare at him.  Germany walks to Chezhslovokia and asks for his wallet. He refuses, but France and Britain make him give it up, so he does.  Germany thanks him, before hitting him over the head with a bat. Austria gives up immediately.  He walks over to Poland, but Britain and France warn him. He calls over the USSR, and they both beat Poland to a pulp.  Britain and France have enough, and officially declare a bar fight. Nothing happens.  Again, the tension is thick enough to cut with a knife. Germany picks up France, and throws him through a window. He gives up.  The USSR takes some steroids.  Britain stands on the bar counter while Germany swings his bat. Britain blocks or dodges all of them. Germany is tired, and thinks that now is the perfect time to attack the USSR.  The USSR gets thrown through a window, and hit with Germany's bat several times, but then the steroids kick in. He uppercuts Germany and he goes flying.  Meanwhile, Japan, who is making sexual advances towards China, hits America over the head with a barstool. America is furious, and they fight.  Italy passes out.  Britain jumps on Germany while he is fighting the USSR. France comes back out of nowhere.  Germany can't take anymore, so he hits himself with his bat, and dies. They split Germany in half as a trophy.  Meanwhile, America is still fighting Japan, whips out a knife and stabs Japan twice.  Everyone is surprised.  Except the USSR, who whistles while he sharpens his own knife behind his back.
1	This happened many years ago when Blackberry phones were still popular A shepherd was herding his flock in a remote pasture when suddenly a brand-new BMW advanced out of the dust cloud towards him. The driver, a young man in a Brioni suit, Gucci shoes, Ray Ban sunglasses and YSL tie, leaned out the window and asked the shepherd, "If I tell you exactly how many sheep you have in your flock, will you give me one?"  The shepherd looked at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looked at his peacefully-grazing flock and calmly answered, "Sure."  The yuppie parked his car, whipped out his lap top and connected it to a cell phone, then he surfed to a NASA page on the internet where he called up a GPS satellite navigation system, scanned the area, and then opened up a database and an Excel spreadsheet with complex formulas.  He sent an e-mail on his Blackberry and, after a few minutes, received a response. Finally, he prints out a 150 page report on his hi-tech miniaturized printer then turns to the shepherd and says, "You have exactly 1386 sheep."  "That is correct; take one of the sheep", said the shepherd.  He watches the young man select one of the animals and bundle it into his car.  Then the Shepherd says: " If I can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my sheep?"  "OK, why not", answered the young man.  "Clearly, you are a consultant", said the shepherd.  "That’s correct," says the yuppie, "but how did you guess that?"  "No guessing required." answers the shepherd. "You turned up here although nobody called you. You want to get paid for an answer I already knew, to a question I never asked, and you don’t know crud about my business. Now give me back my dog."

The wife is touched to tears thinking that her husband is so caring and sensitive. "Yes I do," she replies.  The husband paused. The words were not coming easily. "Do you remember when your father caught us in the back seat of my car making love?"  "Yes, I remember," said the wife, lowering herself into a chair beside him.  The husband continued. "Do you remember when he shoved the shotgun in my face and said, 'Either you marry my daughter, or I will send you to jail for 20 years?'"  "I remember that too" she replied softly.  He wiped another tear from his cheek and said......"I would have gotten out today."

3	A man walks into a bar and orders a Jack and Coke. The bartender reaches  behind the bar and grabs a dark red apple, and hands it to the customer.  Dumbfounded, he says “Hey man, what the hell is this? I asked for a Jack and coke!”  The bartender said “Just go a head and take a bite.”  So the man took a bite and his eyes widened “Wow! That tastes just like Coke!”  “Yup, and now turn it around.”  The customer turned the apple with his fingers and took a bite out of the other side. His eyes closed and squinted and after he swallowed he said “ Oof, man that tastes just like Jack, and it sure is strong too!” He took his apple with him to a seat further down the bar.  A few minutes later another man walks in and asks for a cranberry vodka and Sprite. Once again the bartender reached behind the counter and gave his patron an apple, bright white and shiny, and the patron said “Hey, what gives? I asked you for a drink, not an apple!”  The bartender said “Go a head and take a bite”  So the customer took a bite and and his eyebrows shifted curiously “Huh, that tastes a lot like Sprite.”  “Mmhm. Now turn it around”  The patron did so, and took another bite, and when he did, he was blown away, leaning backwards and staring in amazement at the apple. “That tastes just like cranberry vodka! And it sure is boozy!”  A few apples later, a third man walks into the bar. Before he can order, however, the previous two patrons exclaimed to him. “Dude, this place is amazing, the bartender can give you an apple that tastes like whatever you ask for!” Said the first man.  The second chimed in “Yeah man, it’s incredible!” He held up his apple “I’m on my fifth cranberry vodka and Sprite!”  The new man thinks about his order and says “Anything at all huh? Mr. bartender, I want an apple that tastes like pussy!”  So the barkeep reached behind the counter and pulled out a big, pink apple that was almost shaped like a heart.  The new customer enthusiastically took a big bite of the apple and after a few chews he violently shook his head in disgust, and spat the piece of apple on the the ground halfway across the bar.   “EEEEUGh! That was absolutely disgusting, barkeep, that apple, it... it tasted... it tasted like ABSOLUTE ASS!”  That’s when everyone in the bar shouted “TURN IT AROUND!”

I wanted to help the government, so I told the CIA. In no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.  "I was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running. But the jetting around really tired me out, and I knew I wasn't getting any younger so I decided to settle down. I signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. I uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.  "I got married, had a mess of puppies, and now I'm just retired."  The guy is amazed. He goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.   "Ten dollars," the guy says.  "Ten dollars? This dog is amazing! Why on earth are you selling him so cheap??"  "Because the dog's a damn liar. He never did any of that shit."

2	A wealthy, but stingy father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 18 y/o daughter.    He wanted the party to be extravagant, but wanted to spend as little money as possible. He had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.  "Why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *My daughter is inviting all of her friends, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake*, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.  *How quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "Hello," the father asked, "I would like to buy a cake."  "Of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  The father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  The day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. All of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  The monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "Why do you do this for free? You should take money for your services!"  The monk smiled and said, "I do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."

1	The family history of Jack Schitt We find ourselves at a loss when someone says, "You don't know Jack Schitt!" So, I just researched about his family history for y'all.  Jack Schitt is the only son of Awe Schitt.  Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married Miss O. Needeep They had one son, Jack.  In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt. The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deap Schitt and Dip Schitt.  Against her parents' objections, Deap Schitt married her cousin Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced.  Noe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and, because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt Sherlock.  Meanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition named Chick N. Schitt.  Two of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony.  The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the Schitt-Happens nuptials.  The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Hoarse. Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new Italian bride, Pisa Schitt.

1	Alan takes his wife fishing On a usual trip he catches 10-15 fish. He's gobsmacked when the pair of them manage a haul of over 100! He decided to enter them both into the local fishing competition.  The day of the competition rolls around, and each of the Anglers take it in turns. The first man is a big beefy lad, and he catches 5 fish.  The second is a woman in her 30s, typical american heroine- plaid jacket, shotgun in the 'Trunk' (imitation of course but she  brags that its real) and platinum blonde hair. She manages to catch 17 fish, and it looks like the competition is already over.  Finally, Alan is up. As usual, he only catches 15 fish, which is still good for him. He walks past his competitors, beaming.  "Why are you so happy?" They ask him.  "My wife is up next, and she's sure to win!"  The other competitors laugh, they've seen his wife. Shes in her 50s, tight permed hair and with a little apron, the pinnacle of domesticity, looking like she's never fished in her life.  To their surprise, she catches 250 fish! The competition is called off due to concerns for local wildlife, and everyone is clamouring around Alan and his wife.  A reporter from the local paper wants to do a story on the amazing event and says "who are you amazing Anglers?"  "I'm Alan, and this is my Wife."  "And what's her name?"  "Annette"

1	An American investment banker was at the pier of a small coastal Mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked Inside the small boat were several large yellowfin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took to catch them.    The Mexican replied, “only a little while. The American then asked why didn’t he stay out longer and catch more fish? The Mexican said he had enough to support his family’s immediate needs. The American then asked, “but what do you do with the rest of your time?”    The Mexican fisherman said, “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take siestas with my wife, Maria, stroll into the village each evening where I sip wine, and play guitar with my amigos. I have a full and busy life.” The American scoffed, “I am a Harvard MBA and could help you. You should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. With the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. Instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. You would control the product, processing, and distribution. You would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to Mexico City, then LA and eventually New York City, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”    The Mexican fisherman asked, “But, how long will this all take?”    To which the American replied, “15 – 20 years.”    “But what then?” Asked the Mexican.    The American laughed and said, “That’s the best part. When the time is right you would announce an IPO and sell your company stock to the public and become very rich, you would make millions!”    “Millions – then what?”    The American said, “Then you would retire. Move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”

This was the first and certainly the most spectacular application of civil engineering. Therefore, fair doctor, you are wrong; mine is the oldest profession in the world." The computer scientist leaned back in his chair, smiled, and said confidently, "Ah, but who do you think created the chaos?”

Her name was...  The second widower was shocked. It was an incredibly unique name, and his first wife had that same name. They were only married a short time. She was also an attractive redhead that left him after a series of affairs. Widower 2 informed his friend of this.  Widower 1: Oh, I'm so sorry. It was so long ago and I had completely forgotten she was your wife.  Please forgive me.  Widower 2: It's alright. In a way, it was my fault.  Widower 1: How? I'm the one that slept with your wife.  Widower 2: Yes, but I didn't tell your wife I had mono.

1	The cheapskate painter  A painter named Jack always tried to save a buck whenever he  could, so he often would thin down his paint to make it go a wee bit  further. He somehow managed to get away with this for some time.  One day, the local church decided to do a big restoration project.  Jack put in a painting bid and because his price was so competitive, he got the job.  He erected the trestles. put up the planks, and started thinning down the paint with turpentine.  As Jack was up on the scaffolding painting away, there was a horrendous clap of thunder. The sky opened and the rain poured down,  washing the thin paint from all over the church and knocking Jack off  the scaffold to land on the lawn.  Jack was no fool. He knew this was a judgment from the Almighty, so he fell on his knees and cried, “Oh, God! Forgive me! What should I do?”  And from the thunder, a mighty Voice spoke, “Repaint! Repaint! And thin no more!”

2	An East End gang boss had always been very careful with whom he employed, for fear of being grassed up... He thought he'd been really clever in hiring a crooked accountant who was deaf and dumb. There wasn't much of a risk that he would overhear too much. However, it quickly dawned on the boss that someone was stealing money from him. A lot of money. And it didn't take long for him to discover it was his crooked accountant.  "Benny", he ordered one of his henchmen, "Get that cunt down 'ere, pronto - and get Marty to come with him. He understands sign language".   Later in his office, the boss started interrogating him.  "Marty, ask him what he's done with the money."  At first the terrified accountant signalled his ignorance of the theft but when a gun was put to his head, he spilled the beans. With rapid hand movements, he explained that he'd hidden all the money in a trunk in an old derelict factory, two miles from the office.  "So what did he say?" demanded the boss, impatiently.  "It's no good, boss," replied Marty. "He says you haven't got the bottle to shoot him, so you can go and get fucked".

So they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.

"Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll be happy to sleep in the barn. And if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light."

Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out, "I have to admit that I did." "And did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?" Bob's face turned beet red and he said, "Yeah, look, I'm sorry, buddy. I'm afraid I did. Why do you ask?"  "She just died and left me everything."

2	A joke that’s got me various death threats So there was a horse, and this horse was really talented. He was great on guitar. One day he found himself watching youtube and stumbled upon a Jimi Hendrix song which inspired him to start a cover. He practised this cover really hard, eventually becoming inspired to create a cover of a whole Jimi Hendrix album.  He worked on this cover real hard, finally filming himself and uploading his hard work to youtube. It blows up, gets load of views, people love a horse playing guitar right? But something is missing so he goes to his friend the sheep and says “Hey man you’re the best bass player I know, would you join my cover band?” to which the sheep agrees. They recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. It sounds great, blows up and gets loads of views.   Still something is missing so he goes to his friend the cow and goes “Hey man you’re like amazing at drums, could you join my cover band? It’d mean a lot!” and the cow says, “of course, you’re my buddy and that sounds great!” So again, they recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. It sounds great, blows up and gets loads of views.   But still something is missing. So finally the horse goes to his friend the chicken and says “Hey man I think you’re the last element missing in our cover band - wanna be our vocalist?” and the chicken’s flattered. They recreate the cover album, work really hard and upload it to youtube. It sounds great, blows up and gets MILLIONS of views. It sounds almost as good as the original - by now everyone knows these guys have a talent and theyre forming a fanbase.   They have a healthy career as a cover band, maintaining and growing their fanbase infinitely. So one day the horse says to his band, “Guys. We have all this talent - why don’t we start writing our own music? What is there to lose?” So they start writing their own songs. By this point they’re world-famous, playing tours, signing album covers and getting papped.  Then one day the horse gets a call.  “Hi, I’m Ellen Degeneres and I was wondering if your band would like to join me on my show? One of you will have to come on over to set things up first.” They’re gobsmacked. They’ve finally made it, invited on the Ellen show. After a brief discussion they agree the horse should have the honours of setting up with Ellen, as he has founded their band. So he flies on over in a private jet, spends all day with Ellen practising, sets up and goes back to his fancy five-star all inclusive hotel and pops open a bottle of champagne to himself and calls his friends up, saying “everything’s all ready, come on down.”   Halfway through his third bottle, he gets a call.  “Hi - is this horse? I’m so sorry. There’s been an accident. Your friends died in a plane crash.”  He’s devastated. His whole life, his best friends, everything he’s worked for. Gone. In a flash. Nothing remained. He decides - he has to kill himself. So he gets out of bed, already drunk, and wanders down the street in a dressing gown, stumbling into the shittiest, cheapest, most run down looking bar he could find in town.   He sits at the bar and says “A vodka on the rocks”.   And the bartender goes, “Hey man, why the long face?”

"A woman, about to be married, asked her mother what to wear on her wedding night. 'Wear a heavy, long, flannel nightgown that goes right up to your neck.' But when she asked her best friend, she got conflicting advice. 'Wear your most sexy negligee, with a V neck right down to your navel'".  The woman protested "Rabbi, what does all this have to do with my problem with the IRS?" "Don't you see? It doesn't matter what you wear my dear! Either way, the results will be the same"...

Your baby can fly!” Pete was suddenly taken over by concern and wondering WTF this quack doctor could be talking about. They walked to the nursery together where the doc picked up Pete’s newborn baby boy and said “watch this!! WEEEEEE!!” He tosses the newborn up in to the air. But rather than flying he falls hard to the floor. The nurses had to hold him back. “I know what I did wrong!” Said the doc. He takes the baby over to his desk, clears off all the paperwork and slides the baby across the desk top. “Weeeeeeee!” But the baby just falls off the other side of the desk and goes straight to the ground. Pete still fighting with the nurses. The doc scratches his head, “SHIT, I know he can fly. Let’s try one more time!” He kicks the window open and tosses the baby out. He falls 13 floors to the concrete where he splats into pieces. At this point, Pete is no longer fighting the nurses. He’s on his hand and knees sobbing for his newborn son. The doc puts his hand on Pete’s shoulder and says, “I’m just fucking with you, Pete. Your baby was born dead.”

1	A kid goes off to the army and comes back home after basic training. He's having a chat with his dad about his experience, telling him how it went.  "So the first thing they do was have me run 15 miles. It was brutal. I had to have my fatigues on and carry my provisions. The drill sergeant said if we didn't do that we had to run 30 Miles the next day."  "So did you run?"  "Of course Dad! The next day we were to learn swimming techniques. We had to swim five miles nonstop, or the next day we would have to swim 10."  "So did ya swim it?"  "Of course Dad! The next day we had to do sky diving. Well you know I'm deathly scared of heights. So the drill sergeant said if I didn't jump out of that plane asap he had a baseball bat he carried for these occasions. He said if I didn't jump on the count not five he'd shove it up my ass!"  "So... You jumped?"  "Of course Dad! At first anyway."
2	An old man decides that he wants to see a bullfight before he dies. Immediately upon arriving in Spain, the man makes his way to the arena, then cheers along with the crowd as he watches the matador fight the bull. For as much fun as it is, he soon realizes that the travel and the excitement have left him feeling worn out, so he decides to find a nearby restaurant before making his way to his hotel. Fortunately enough (for both the old man and for this overly long joke), he finds a place right around the corner, appropriately named "The Bull."  Well, it turns out that quite a few of the assembled spectators had the same desire to get an after-fight meal, and the old man finds himself in amongst a pretty large crowd. This proves to be a blessing in disguise, though, because he gets to watch as one of the other patrons is served a large, sizzling bowl which contains two delectable-looking (and oddly spherical) portions of meat.  "Scusi, scusi!" the old man says, flagging down a waiter.  "That's Italian," the waiter replies (in perfect English). "What do you need, sir?"  In response, the old man points at the dish that he'd seen. "What is that person having?"  "Ah, that is our specialty," the waiter replies. "We call it The Bull's Balls."  The old mans nods. "I'd like to order that, please!"  "Ah, señor, I'm very sorry," the waiter answers, "but I'm afraid that The Bull's Balls is a popular dish, and we sell out almost immediately during the after-fight rush. Still, if you come back tomorrow, I'm sure we'll be able to serve you."  Well, the old man quickly decides that he isn't leaving Spain before sampling The Bull's Balls, so he resolves to visit the restaurant as soon as it opens the next morning. This proves to be easier said than done, though, because he arrives to find the doors locked and the lights dimmed. At first, he thinks that he'll just come back later... but because he doesn't want to miss his chance at his meal, he instead decides that he'll just wait. He sits on a nearby bench, listening to the sounds of the fight drifting over from the arena, until the very second when The Bull finally opens.  "I'd like to order The Bull's Balls, signore!" the old man declares, even before he's been seated.  The waiter makes a visible effort at suppressing a sigh. "That's still Italian, sir. Anyway, it will take a little while for the chef to prepare everything."  The old man murmurs his understanding, then settles in to wait some more. Several minutes pass, during which the restaurant fills with the crowd from the arena. Then, at long last, a large, sizzling bowl is carried into view. The old man sits up, his stomach rumbling at the thought of the feast that he's about to receive... but to his dismay, he only sees two small, walnut-size lumps of meat in the dish. Not wanting to make a fuss (especially not after having spoken the wrong language twice), the man despondently eats his meal.  Not long later, the waiter approaches again. "How was it, señor?" he asks the old man.  "I'll be honest," the old man responds, "I was kind of disappointed. The servings I saw yesterday seemed like they were a lot larger."  "Well, yes, señor," the waiter replies, "but the bull doesn't always lose."

1	John and the cab driver One cold, winter evening John finished his office job in London Victoria and went straight to the pub. He had few drinks too many that night and decided to take a cab home, but when he looked in his wallet he only had last £20 inside. He approached a black cab outside the pub and asked how much would it cost him to go to Kings Cross and the cabbie replied £25. After asking if he could possibly take him for £20 the cab driver declined and told him to get a buss. John was desperate for that cab so he asked again and again but without any luck, the cab driver just wouldn’t change his mind. So having no choice John had to take a bus home. The next morning he woke up with a sore head and it was time to go back to work. When he left his apartment and was walking past Kings Cross station he passed a long line of black taxis and on the end of that line was the cabbie from last night. John went back to the first taxi and asked the driver how much was it to Victoria, he replied £25. John said “ I’ll give you £50 if you suck me off on our way” The cabbies response was “Fuck off you pervert”. Then John approached the second cab in line and popped the same question and pretty much got the same response. He carried on from cab to cab asking the same question and getting the same answer until he finally got to the last cab, the one from previous night in Victoria. He asked the driver “How much is it to Victoria?” He responded “It’s £25 mate”, then John said “ I tell you what, I’ll give you £50 if you drive off slowly and we both wave to all of your cabdriver friends”

"Just for me," she says, "can you show me what your bare legs look like?"  "All right," says the boyfriend, "but don't tell anyone." He leaves the room and comes back wearing shorts that show his very lumpy knees. "I had kneasles as a child," he says.  "You mean measles."  "No, I mean kneasles.

1	[NSFW] A American businessman takes a trip to Japan An American businessman travels to Japan for a very important business meeting that will make or break his career. He realizes that sealing the deal for their business will not happen in the board room and so he agrees to join them afterwards for a night out on the town.   After a night of drinking and eating he still hasn’t sealed the deal so he convinces them to meet in two days to play a few rounds of golf. Having nothing to do the next day, the businessman takes the time to learn as much as he can about his client and their culture to try and win them over.   Unfortunately, he has no idea how to go about this or what to do so he just wanders the city taking in the sites. The night before his game, he is so full of nervous energy that he decides to solicit the services of a prostitute.   Later, when they were in the throes of passion, she suddenly screamed out "Machigatta ana!”. Having no idea what this meant he interpreted her wildly bucking against him to mean he was performing exceptionally well, so he kept going and ended with an amazing climax. After he finished, she collapsed in a sweaty mess, moaning from what he took be ecstasy.    With sweat pouring down her face and her eyes brimming with with tears she moaned, “Anata ga baka machigatta ana”, he smiled proudly at this congratulation and went to sleep satisfied.   The next day, while in the middle of his round of golf, one of his Japanese associates hit a perfect 6-iron off the tee right into the cup for a hole-in-one! Remembering his new phrase and wanting to impress his associates with his linguistic proficiency, the man yelled out “”Anata ga baka machigatta ana”   Perplexed, the Japanese associate turned to him and asked, "What do you mean, wrong hole you idiot?”

2	And that, boys and girls, is why we should never end our sentences with a preposition. On his 74th birthday, an old man received a gift certificate from his wife...  The certificate paid for a visit to a medicine man living on a nearby reservation who was rumored to have a wonderful cure for erectile dysfunction.       After being persuaded to go, he drove to the reservation, handed his ticket to the medicine man and wondered what he was in for.   The old man handed a potion to him, and with a grip on his shoulder, warned, "This is a powerful medicine. You take only a teaspoon and then say '1-2-3'." When you do, you will become more manly than you have ever been in your life and you can perform as long as you  want."       The man was encouraged. As he walked away, he turned and asked, "How do I stop the medicine from working?"     "Your partner must say '1-2-3-4,'" the medicine man responded, "but when she does, the medicine will not work again until the next full moon."       The man was very eager to see if it worked so he went home, showered, shaved, took a spoonful of the medicine and then invited his wife to join him in the bedroom. When she came in, he quickly took off his clothes and said, "1-2-3!" Immediately, he was the manliest of men. His wife was excited and began throwing off her clothes as she asked "What was the 1-2-3 for?"        And that, boys and girls, is why we should never end our sentences with a preposition, because we could end up with a dangling participle.  #repost  All credits to whoever came up with this joke. I hope you are doing fine. It make me laugh every once in a while.

He was born by a miracle, by the intervention of a magical being from the heavens."  "Very interesting," said Jesus. "Did this boy ever have to fight temptation?"  "Oh, yes, many times," answered the old man. "But he eventually won. Unfortunately, he heroically died at one point, but he came back to life shortly afterwards."  Jesus couldn't believe it. Could this actually be His father?  "One last question," He said. "Were you a carpenter?"  "Why yes," replied the old man. "Yes I was."  Jesus rubbed His eyes and said, "Dad?"  The old man rubbed his eyes and said, "Pinocchio?"

"It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking."  “It hasn't affected my brothers though."

2	A local business owner was looking for office help. The owner put a sign in the window that read: “Help wanted. Must be able to type, must be good with a computer, and must be bilingual. We are an equal opportunity employer.”  A short time later, a dog trotted up to the window, saw the sign, and went inside. After going inside, the dog looked at the receptionist and wagged his tail, then he walked over to the sign, looked at it, and whined. The receptionist got the idea and told the office manager. The office manager looked at the dog and was surprised, to say the least. However, the dog looked determined, so the manager led the dog into his office.   Inside, the dog jumped up onto a chair and started patiently staring at the manager. The manager said, “I can’t hire you. The sign says that you have to be able to type.”  The dog jumped down, walked over to a computer and typed out a perfect letter and then signed his name. The manager was stunned but then told the dog, “I still can’t hire you. The sign says that you have to be good with computers too.” The dog then went over to the computer and typed up a program that ran perfectly on the first test. By now, the manager was totally dumbfounded and said to the dog, “I realize that you are a very intelligent dog and you have some interesting skills. However, I still can’t give you the job.”  The dog jumped down and walked over to the sign and put his paw on the part where it said ‘equal opportunity employer’.  The manager said, “Yes, but the sign also says that you have to be bilingual.”   The dog calmly looked up at the manager and said, “Meow.”

So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that. .and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.  After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says,  "Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had!

2	The horse, the cow, and the chicken[LONG] So a horse, a cow, and a chicken live on a farm. One day their owner goes on vacation but accidentally leaves the TV on. The animals peek in the window and witness a rock concert on the TV, theyre inspired.  So the horse calls up guitar center, and asks “hey I want to learn the guitar, but there’s one problem: I’m a horse.” The employee says “no problem come right down we’ll teach you everything you need to know” and before you know it, he’s jamming out on the guitar. After that the cow calls too and says “hey I want to learn how to play the bass but there’s a problem: I’m a cow” to where the employee replies “awesome! We have special bass lessons just for cows this week come on down!” And before you know it the horse and cow are jamming in harmony with their guitar and bass. Lastly the chicken calls and asks for drum lessons, to where he is accepted with open arms. They are now all jamming in the barn and having a blast.  A few days later, a record producer coincidentally walks through town and sees the horse, cow, and the chicken making music. He instantly knows he has to make them famous and offers them a deal. Now the horse, cow, and chicken are famous, worldwide rockstars making millions of dollars and even moved off the farm to a luxurious estate. With the fortune came fame and life was great.  One day, on the way to tour before boarding the plane, the horse gets a phone call, his mom is sick! The cow and the chicken say “don’t worry we’ll go without you, catch up and the tour will continue it’ll be fine” so the horse goes to check on his mother. It turns out it was a false alarm, but the plane crashes and the cow and chicken die.  The horse is devestated, the money power and fame is gone, the music is in the past, and he is back to the barn, but alone without his friends. In agony and desperation after such a long journey, he decides to get a drink. He walks into the bar and the bartender asks:  “Why the long face?”

3	Joseph One night, I was about to propose to my girlfriend, when my roommate Joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped, fell over and broke my glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood.  Now, I didn't know Joseph THAT well, I didn't even know where he was from, but since he was my roommate, I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.  Joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. He had to go about his life with one of those cotton pads in his eyes for a couple of months. Then suddenly, he disappeared......along with my girlfriend.  I later found out that they'd both had bonded after his injuries and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. I tried to track both of them down, but never could.  In conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago. Where'd you come from? Where'd you go? Where'd you come from, cotton eye Joe?

Standing over a corpse, he addressed the class.  “There are two things you need to make a career in medical forensics.  First, you must have no fear.”  Having said that, he shoved his finger up the corpse's anus, withdrew it, then licked his finger.  “Now you must do the same,” he told the class.  After a couple of minutes of uneasy silence, the class did as instructed.  “Second,” the professor continued, “you must have an acute sense of observation. For instance, how many of you noticed that I put my middle finger up this man's anus, but licked my index finger?”

But I have no idea what to do with your information, and I’m still lost. Frankly, you’ve not been much help to me.”  The man smiled and responded, “You must be a Republican.”  “I am,” replied the balloonist. “How did you know?”  “Well,” said the man, “you don’t know where you are — or where you are going. You’ve risen to where you are , due to a large quantity of hot air. You made a promise you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. You’re in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but somehow, now it’s my fault.”

1	A school teacher, a police officer, and a hedge fund founder are trapped on a deserted island. After scavenging for days with little success, they come across a magical lamp.  The officer decides to give it a quick rub and out pops a genie.  "Hello, I am here to grant each of you an imperishable supply of food and water as you await your rescue.  Be warned, it can only be consumed only by you.  All you have to do in return is to give me something of value.  If you manage to leave this island alive, the item will be returned to you."  After a brief silence as the three contemplated the situation, the teacher hands over her engagement ring.  "I am not sure how much this is worth, but it is the thing I treasure the most."  The genie looks at the ring.  "You shall receive two weeks supply of food and water."  The food and water materialize out of thin air and the woman is a bit disheartened at the short supply but nevertheless thanks the genie.  Seeing this, the officer steps up.  "This is the key to my 2017 Dodge Challenger SRT."  The genie frowns.  "This is just a key, but I admire your wit. 3 months supply for you."  The officer smiles and walks away.  The hedge fund manager steps up to the genie and smiles.  "Here, take my phone."  The genie looks amused.  "I assume you are offering your fund?"  "Sure am!"  The man states.  The genie nods and a single bottle of Nestle water materializes.  "What the fucking hell is this?  That damn cop gave you a car that has depreciated to $35k and that woman's ring cannot be worth more than $5k! I gave you more than $20 billion you fool!"  The genie paused for a moment, sensing the rage building in the billionaire's eyes.  "Your numbers are right but why would you assume I have an endless supply of food and water?  Surely, this cannot be the first time you have come up short."

1	There is a fly.... (medium) Hovering near the surface of a mountain lake. Over on the shore sits a frog. The frog says “If the fly drops four inches, I can eat him.”  Just below the surface of the lake is a fish. The fish sees the frog and says “If the fly drops for inches, the frog can get the fly, and I can get the frog.”  On the shore of this lake sits a bear. The bear sees the situation and thinks to himself “If the fly drops four inches, the frog can get the fly, the fish can get the frog, and I can get the fish.”  Sitting on the opposite shore sits a hunter. Looking over it all, the hunter says to himself “If the fly drops four inches, the frog can get the fly, the fish can get the frog, the bear can get the fish, and I’ll be able to shoot the bear.”   Sitting right by the hunter is a mouse. The mouse says to himself “If the fly drops four inches, the frog can get the fly, the fish can get the frog, the bear can get the fish, the hunter will pick up his gun to shoot the bear, dropping his food while doing so, and I can get his food.”  Sitting up the hill is a bobcat. The bobcat sees the scenario, and thinks “If the fly drops four inches, the frog can get the fly, the fish can get the frog, the bear can get the fish, the hunter will pick up his gun to shoot the bear, dropping his food while doing so, the mouse gets the food, and while they eat, I can pounce on them.”  So the fly drops four inches. The frog gets the fly, the fish gets the frog, the bear gets the fish, the hunter, dripping his food, gets the bear, and the mouse gets the food. The bobcat, seizing the opportunity, lunges for the mouse, but misses and lands in the lake.   So what’s the moral of the story? If the fly drops four inches, the pussy gets wet.

1	Jokes from the 90's seem popular here. How about one from the 80's? Little Timmy had a severe stutter. However, his mother decided that this was no reason for him to not live a normal life, and so decided he should try taking the bus to school on his own.   "It's very simple," she assured her nervous boy. "When you board the bus tomorrow morning, tell the conductor, 'Sir, I want to go to Maple Avenue.'"  So the next day, little Timmy boarded the bus and said to the conductor, "S-s-s-sir, I want t-t-t-to go to Map-p-p-le Avenue." To his astonishment, the conductor clipped his ear before signalling the driver to move off. The day after that, he thought he'd try again. When the bus arrived, he said to the conductor, "Sir, t-t-t-t-take me to Map-p-p-," and this time, he couldn't even finish before the conductor slapped him again.   When it happened yet again, Timmy told his mother about it, and she decided to have it out with the conductor. Accordingly, the next day, the bus arrived and there was the same person. Timmy's mother angrily marched up onto the bus and demanded of the conductor, "Why do you keep hitting my son?"   The conductor flushed with anger, pointed at Timmy and retorted, "B-b-b-brat k-k-keeps mock-k-k-king me!"

1	Florida Woman Stops 12' Alligator with a .22 cal Beretta Pistol \\[Long\\]  This is a story of self-control and marksmanship by a brave, cool-headed woman with a small pistol against a fierce predator.  What's the smallest caliber that you would trust to protect yourself?  Here's her story in her own words:  "While walking along the edge of a pond just outside my house in the Villages discussing a property settlement with my soon-to-be ex-husband, and other divorce issues, we were surprised by a huge 12-ft alligator which suddenly emerged from the murky water.  It began charging us with its large jaws wide open. She must have been protecting her nest because she was extremely aggressive.  If I had not had my little Beretta .22 caliber pistol with me, I would not be here today!  Just one shot to my estranged husband's knee cap was all it took. The gator got him easily, and I was able to escape by just walking away at a brisk pace.  The amount I saved in lawyer's fees was really incredible and his life insurance was also a big bonus!\\`\\`

2	I have a friend who was obsessed with the moon. Lunar cycles, werewolf lore, eclipse dates, he knew all about them and then some. The really strange part was he focused solely on the moon in this way, no other part of space.  Made him easy to shop for though. Werewolf movies, moon pies, he'd love them just for being tangentially connected to the moon, and even just neat pictures of the moon excited him.  Then came his most recent birthday, where we saved up and bought him actual moon rocks. He opened the gift, but he didn’t seem enthused at all. "What's wrong?" We asked.  He sighed. "It's nothing. I guess I'm... over the moon."

The barman, rather surprised that a talking motorway has walked into his bar, pours him a whisky and he sits down at the table.   A few minutes later, a second motorway kicks open the door and walks in.   He says "I'm the M1. I have 900,000 vehicles drive over me every day. I make the M4 look like a child. I'm the hardest there is. Nobody can touch me. Now get me a fucking drink."

The barman can hear the two motorways comparing their size and and arguing over who is the toughest, when the door swings open again.  In walks a small, narrow, piece of red tarmac. Both the M4 and M1 shut up immediately and stare down at their drinks, too terrified to look up.  Confused, the barman asks "what's the matter guys? Just now, you two were telling me how tough you are and how there is nobody harder, but now you're both staring down at your drinks too scared to look up..?"  The motorways look up and say "We're not messing with him. Nobody ever does. He's a cycle path."

3	Jesus and Moses go Fishing Jesus and Moses are sitting by a riverbank, fishing, and shooting the shit about the good ol' days.    Moses says, "I had a few great days, but I have to say, that day I parted the Red Sea was the best of them. Man, that was spectacular! You should have seen the look on everyone's faces."    Jesus replies, "Yeah, Mo. But that was a long time ago. You think you still got what it takes?"    Moses indignantly rises to his feet. "Watch this!". He holds his fishing pole across the river....and the water parts!    Moses hops down onto the riverbed, and struts toward the far bank. Once there, he plucks out a blade of grass, and tucks it in his cheek, before sauntering back to where Jesus waits. He climbs up on the bank, turns back toward the river, make a gesture with his hands, and the water comes back together.    Jesus says, "Mo, that was pretty impressive...but I'll have you know as a younger man I used to *walk* on water."    Moses smiles, and makes a sweeping gesture towards the river.    Jesus walks to the edge, looks at the water, and it flattens out like a sheet of glass. He hops down onto the surface and begins to stride across the river.    He gets about ¼ of the way across, and the water is up over his ankles. He gets ½ way across, and the water is approaching his knees. Jesus realizes that he's not going to make it to the far bank and back, so he turns around, and hustles back to where he started.    By the time he gets there, the water is waist-high. Moses hauls him out of the river, laughing.    Jesus scowls, wringing out his robe, and says, "Give me a break, man. That's before I had these damn holes in my feet."

2	The Red Indian with one testicle There once was a Red Indian who had only one testicle, and whose given name was 'Onestone.'  He hated that name and asked everyone not to call him Onestone.  After years & years of torment,Onestone finally cracked and said,  'If anyone calls me Onestone again I will kill him!'  The word got around and nobody called him that anymore.  Then one day a young woman named Blue Bird forgot and said, 'Good morning, Onestone.'  He jumped up, grabbed her, and took her deep into the forest where he made love to her all day and all night. He made love to her all the next day until Blue Bird died from exhaustion.  The word got around that Onestone meant what he promised he would do.  Years went by and no one dared call him by his given name  Until a woman named Yellow Bird returned to the village after being away.  Yellow Bird, who was Blue Bird's cousin, was overjoyed when she saw Onestone.  She hugged him and said, 'Good to see you, Onestone.'  Onestone grabbed her, took her deep into the forest, then he made love to her all day, made love to her all night, made love to her all the next day, made love to her all the next night, but Yellow Bird wouldn't die!    What is the moral of this story?   You can't kill two birds with one stone!!

I’m not that stupid pal, I know doors 1 & 3 are a trap, I’m taking the white door!”   The man proudly strides towards doors 2and flings it open, it’s completely dark inside and he can now clearly hear people chant “don’t make a wave... don’t make a wave...” he takes one last look at Satan , smiles, says “ DON’T make a wave huh?” And does the biggest bomb he’s ever done into the darkness...  And as he falls he see’s the people who were chanting... standing neck deep in shit.

2	Jimmy's wife won't orgasm Jimmy's wife has never had an orgasm in bed with him.  It begins to annoy him so he goes to the doctor and asks for help. The doctor has an odd suggestion - that sometimes women are too warm and this impedes the process. So all he has to do is buy a fan and put it in the room, and it'll solve the problem.  At the hardware store Jimmy looks at all the fans on offer but - he's a little cheap and cantankerous - he thinks they're all too expensive and this is some kinda 'Big-fan racket' that he'll outsmart.  He drives back and calls into his neighbor Murphy, explaining the scenario. He brings Murphy into the bedroom with his wife and hands him a tea towel, telling him to stand in the corner and flap the tea towel so that his wife will remain cool. Murphy is confused but goes along with it.  Jimmy gets into bed and gets started while Murphy flaps away in the corner. An hour goes by - nothing, and Murphy's hands are getting tired. Finally Murphy suggests they swap places, to see if that helps. Jimmy and his wife agree, so Murphy gets into the bed and Jimmy flaps the towel. Within five minutes Jimmy's wife is screaming in pleasure with the most intense orgasms she has ever had, and within ten minutes they're both flopped on the bed, exhausted.  Jimmy walks up to Murphy. "You see that?" he says triumphantly "That's how you flap a tea towel!"

Upon making several false alarm trips to the bathroom, he figured that the latest episode was just that, so he stayed put.

In a complete loss of composure, he jumped out of bed, gathered up the bed sheets, and threw them out the hospital window.  A drunk was walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on him.

The new priest hears a couple of confessions, then the old priest asks him to step out of the confessional for a few suggestions.  The old priest suggests, "Cross your arms over your chest, and rub your chin with one hand and try saying things like 'yes, I see,' and 'yes, go on,' and 'I understand.'  The new priest crosses his arms, rubs his chin with one hand and repeats all the suggested remarks to the old priest.  The old priest says, "Now, don't you think that's a little better than slapping your knee and saying, "No kidding, what happened next?"
2	A young jackaroo from outback Queensland goes off to university, but halfway through the semester he foolishly has squandered all of his money.  He calls home. 'Dad,' he says, 'you won't believe what modern education is developing. They actually have a program here in Brisbane that will teach our dog Ol' Blue how to talk.'   'That's amazing!' his Dad says. 'How do I get Ol' Blue in that program?'   'Just send him down here with $2,000,' the young jackaroo says, 'I'll get him in the course.'   So ... his father sends the dog and $2,000.   About two-thirds through the semester, the money again runs out. The boy calls home. 'So how's Ol' Blue doing, son?' his father wants to know.   'Awesome! Dad, he's talking up a storm. But you just won't believe this. They've had such good results with talking, they've begun to teach the animals how to read.'   'Read?' exclaims his father. 'No kidding! How do we get Ol' Blue in that program?'   'Just send $4,500. I'll get him in the class.'   The money promptly arrives. But our hero has a problem. At the end of the year, his father will find out the dog can neither talk nor read. So he shoots the dog. When he arrives home at the end of the year, his father is all excited.   'Where's Ol' Blue? I just can't wait to talk with him, and see him read something!'   'Dad,' the boy says, 'I have some grim news. Yesterday morning, just before we left to drive home, Ol' Blue was in the living room, kicked back in the recliner, reading the Wall Street Journal. Then he suddenly turned to me and asked, 'So, is your daddy still messing around with that little redhead barmaid at the pub?''   The father groans and whispers, 'I hope you shot that bastard before he talks to your Mother!'   'I sure did, Dad!'   'That's my boy!'   The kid went on to be a successful lawyer.

The first one says "I want to have enough money that I don't have to work another day in my life." As soon as he finished, his phone beeped saying he had $10 Mil in the bank.  The next guy says "I want to be the richest man in the world". His phone beeped, and he almost fainted from seeing his balance.  The third friend says "I want my left arm to keep spinning forwards."  The Genie says "Alright my friends, your second wish please"  The first friend says "I want to be married to the most beautiful woman in the world". Just like that, the most beautiful woman does appear, walks right upto him and they start going at it.  The second friend says "I want to be the most good looking man to ever exist. So good looking that no woman can resist my advances". He leaves the room for a few minutes and comes back with a harem of women who will do anything he asks of them.  The third friend says "I want my right arm to keep spinning backwards"  The Genie says "Alright, what is your third and final wish? Please choose wisely"  The first friend says "I want to be the healthiest man. No disease or medical complications to ever show up". He calls his doctor who examines him and says he's the healthiest man he's ever seen and would like to collect some blood samples for research.  The second friend says "I want to leave behind a legacy and be able to set up a charity which will cure any disease that shows up." Soon after, a team of scientists arrive and they start discussing treatments for various diseases.  The third friend says "I want my head to keep nodding up and down".  Many many years later, the three friends arrange to meet with each other and catch up on good times. The first two friends show up on time and were waiting for the last guy.  "Life is amazing. I still don't have to work and have all the time to pursue whatever I want to do. I'm so healthy, I never feel tired and can go at it all day with my wife. The sex is crazy!"  The second friend, with a wink, says "I know all about your wife."  The third friend, with his arms swinging wildly and his head nodding up and down, then arrives and says "Guys, I think I fucked up"
3	Old Butch    John was in the fertilized egg business. He had several hundred young laying hens, called 'pullets,' and ten roosters to fertilize the eggs.  Any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced. This took a lot of time, so he bought some tiny bells and attached them to his roosters.  Each bell had a different tone, so he could tell just from listening, which rooster was never performing. John could sit on the porch and log a performance report by just listening to the bells.  John's favorite rooster was old Butch, a very fine specimen, but one morning he noticed old Butch's bell hadn't rung at all! When he went to investigate, he saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing.   To John's amazement, old Butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. Butch had learned to not chase the pullets, instead he would just quietly walk up on a pullet, do his job and walk on.  John was so proud of old Butch, he entered him in the Saint Lawrence County Fair and he became an overnight sensation with the judges. The judges not only awarded old Butch the "No-Bell Piece-Prize," they also awarded him the "Pulletsurprise" as well.

If you must know, I'm using it on my Schnauzer."  The Pharmacist said,  "Well, stay off your Bicycle for at least a Week".

1	Once upon a time... So there's a far-off place that consists of a perfectly triangular lake surrounded by land, with three kingdoms on the three sides of the lake. The first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy prosperous people. The second kingdom is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power too, and the third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.  The kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have.  The first kingdom sends 100 of their finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire.  The second kingdom sends 50 of their knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own.  The third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.  The night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and make merry, partying into the late hours of the night. The knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and also drink late into the night.  In the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and slings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. He fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.  The next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old and weary, unable to get up.  In place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. The battle lasts long into the night, but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.  And it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

He walks in, orders a drink, and just sits there licking his eyebrows . . .’
2	There was a young couple very much in love... There was a young couple very much in love. On the night before they were to be married, both were killed in an accident. They found themselves at the pearly gates of heaven being escorted in by St. Peter.  After a couple of weeks in heaven, the prospective groom took St. Peter aside and said, "St. Peter, my fiancee and I are very happy to be in heaven, but we miss very much the opportunity to have our wedding vows celebrated. Is it possible for people in heaven to get married?"  St. Peter looked at him and said, "I'm sorry, I've never heard of anyone in heaven wanting to get married. I'm afraid you'll have to talk to the Lord God Almighty about that. I can get you an appointment in two weeks from Wednesday."  Come the appointed day, the couple was escorted by the guardian angels into the presence of the Lord God Almighty, where they repeated the request. The Lord looked at them solemnly and said, "I tell you what; wait a year and if you still want to get married, come back and we will talk about it again."  A year went by and the couple, still very much wanting to get married, came back. Again, the Lord God Almighty said, "I'm sorry to disappoint you but you must wait another year, and then I will consider your request."  This happened year after year, for ten years. Each time they reasserted their yearning to be married; each time God put them off for another year. In the tenth year, they came before they Lord God Almighty to ask again. This time the Lord answered, "Yes, you may marry! This Saturday at 2:00 p.m. We will have a beautiful ceremony in the main chapel. The reception will be on me!"  The wedding went off without a hitch. The bride looked beautiful. The Buddha did the flower arrangements for which Moses wove simple yet elegant baskets. Jesus prepared the fish course. All of heaven's denizens attended, and a good time was had by all.  Tragically, but perhaps inevitably, within a few weeks, the newlyweds realized that they had made a horrible mistake. They simply couldn't stay married to one another. So they made another appointment to see the Lord God Almighty. Groveling and frightened, they asked if they could get a divorce. The Lord heard their request, looked at them, and said, "Look, it took us TEN YEARS to find a priest up here in heaven. Do you have any idea how long it'll take us to find a lawyer?"
2	Last year I replaced several windows in my house and they were the expensive double-pane energy efficient kind. But this week I got a call from the contractor complaining that his work has been completed for a whole year and I had yet to pay for them.  Boy oh boy did we go 'round. Just because I'm blonde doesn't mean that I am automatically stupid. So, I proceeded to tell him just what his fast talking sales guy had told me last year. . that in one year the windows would pay for themselves.  There was silence on the other end of the line so I just hung up and I haven't heard back. Guess I must have won that silly argument.

The bartender tells him that in order to win the jar of money, he has to complete 3 challenges, but the entry fee is 100$.       After some thinking, he decides to enter the contest.

When everyone was thinking that John has died he comes back inside all bitten and bleeding.    Everyone is looking wide-eyed at him as he sighs and says “So, where is the old lady with the toothache?”

1	A biker stopped by the local Harley shop to have his bike repaired. They couldn’t do the work while he waited, and so, since he didn’t live far from the shop, he decided to walk home. On the way home he stopped at the hardware store and bought a bucket and an anvil. He stopped at the feed store / livestock dealer and picked up a couple of chickens and a goose. However, he had a problem… How to carry his entire purchase home. The feed store owner said, “Why don’t you put the anvil in the bucket, carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?” “Hey, thanks!” said the biker, and out the door he went. In the parking lot he was approached by a little old lady who told him she was lost, and asked if he could tell her the way to 1603 Mockingbird Lane. The biker said, as a matter of fact, I live at 1616 Mockingbird Lane.” We can take a short cut down this alley and be there in no time”. The little old lady looked him over cautiously, and then said, “I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me.

A young man is heading home from a big night in the town.     As he walks through a seedier part of the city, he spots a lady of the night who is the most beautiful woman he has ever set his eyes upon.     He wanders over to her and quietly asks, "How much?"     The sex worker turns and says," sorry honey, but I am out of action. Bad case of warts."     Not to be put off, the guy thinks and says "I'll pay double for anal."     The woman turns and says "no can do. Collapsed colon and it only exports, no deliveries."     He thinks again, and lightens up as he jumps to his next question.     "What about a blowie?" He asked.     "Nope. Mouth ulcers," she replies.     Stumped he rolls his last chance.     "How about a handjob?"     "Sorry hon. I have terrible dermatitis and my hands are all split."     Gutted, the young guy turns and is about to walk off when the hooker says," actually, there is one thing we can do, but it's a bit out there."

And with that she moves her hand to her face AND POPS OUT A FALSE EYE!     "What the fuck!?!???" The guy stammers.     "It's okay," the hooker says.     "Trust me, just pop your knob in."     Pants around his ankles, the guy looks around, sees no one and thinks "fuck it. I'll give it a try."     He slides it in and it is the most magnificent feeling he has ever felt.     He stands their for what feels like eternity before it all becomes to much and he pops his load.     Panting and covered in a sheen of sweat, the guy looks down at the hooker and says," that was amazing. Can we do that again soon?"     She replies," Sure....     "I'll keep an eye out for you."

5	On a crowded train, travelling somewhere in Europe. A U.S. Marine walked the entire length of the train looking for a seat before realizing that the only seat available was currently occupied by a well-dressed, middle-aged French woman's poodle.  The weary Marine asked, "Ma'am, may I have that seat?" The French woman just sniffed, and said to no one in particular, "Americans are so rude. My little Fifi is using that seat." The Marine walked the entire length of the train again, and discovered that the only seat available was in fact the one currently being occupied by the poodle. Trudging tiredly back, the marine arrived once more before the French woman and said, “Please Ma'am, may I sit down? I'm very tired?” She snorted, "Not only are you Americans rude, you are also arrogant. Why should I care if you are tired?" This time, the Marine didn't say a word, but simply picked up the little dog, tossed it out the train window, then sat down. The woman shrieked, "Someone, defend my honour! This American needs to be put in his place!" An English gentleman sitting nearby spoke up, "Sir, you Americans seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You hold your fork in the wrong hand, and you drive your cars on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you seem to have thrown the wrong bitch out the window."

A Scotsman, an Irishman, and an Englishman are each sentenced to a year in solitary confinement; before being locked away, each is to be granted a year's supply of whatever he wants to help him get through the long, long spell alone.  The Scotsman asks for a year's supply of whiskey; it's given to him and he's locked away.  The Irishman asks for a year's supply of Guinness so he's locked up with several thousand bottles of the dry stout.  The Englishman asks for a year's supply of cigarettes and he's given a pile of cartons and the cell door is shut on him.  One year later, the doors are all unlocked. The Scotsman staggers out and shouts, "I'm free!" and then keels over dead from alcohol poisoning.  The Irishman is dragged out into the light, whereupon he promptly dies of liver failure.

To their surprise, he walks right out the door, sidles up to the first person he sees, and asks, "I say ...  you wouldn't happen to have a match, would you?"

1	One morning, a guy was looking at his beautiful body in the mirror. He realized he was getting a nice tan all over, except on his dick. But how to tan only his penis without over tanning his body?  So he had an idea. He went to the beach, buried himself in the sand completely except for his penis, which was sticking out of the sand.   Later, two old ladies strolled by and saw the dick growing out of the sand. So one says to the other:  “You know, life really isn’t fair at all!”   “Why do you say that?”   “When I was 20 I was curious about them. When I was 30, I enjoyed them. When I was 40 I had to ask for them. When I was 50 I paid for them. When I was 60 I begged for them. When I was 70 I forgot they even existed. Now that I’m 80, the dicks are growing in the wild, and I can’t bend over!”

1	Permits required A woman from Sydney who was a tree hugging, vegetarian and anti-hunter purchased a piece of native bush land in northern N.S.W.   There was a large gum tree on one of the highest points in her property.   She wanted a good view of the natural splendour of her land, so she started to climb the big gum.   As she neared the top, she encountered a koala that attacked her. In her haste to escape, the woman slid down the tree to the ground and got many splinters in her crotch.   In considerable pain, she hurried to a local ER to see a doctor.  She told him she was an environmentalist, vegetarian, and an anti-hunter and how she came to get all the splinters.   The doctor listened to her story with great patience and then told her to go wait in the examining room and he would see if he could help her.   She sat and waited three hours before the doctor re-appeared.  The angry woman demanded, "What took you so long?"   He smiled and then told her, "Well, I had to get permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, Native Vegetation, Parks and Wildlife service, and the Bureau of Land Management before I could remove old-growth timber from a 'recreational area' so close to a Waste Treatment Facility.    And I'm sorry, they turned you down.”

"Well," he says, "astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Meteorologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Theologically, I see that God is all-powerful, and we are small and insignificant. Uh, what does it tell you, Holmes?"  "Watson, you idiot. Someone has stolen our tent!”

And honestly she's a wonderfully sweet woman.  But increasingly I find it very hard to visit.  The problem is that when she has her schizophrenic episodes and suffers visual hallucinations, she feels compelled to tell me about them in lurid detail, and to ask me to confirm whether what she saw was real or a hallucination.  I just can't take it anymore.  I guess what I'm saying is that down by the bay (down by the bay), where the watermelons grow (where the watermelons grow), back to my home (back to my home), I dare not go (I dare not go).  For if I do, my mother will say, did you ever see a duck, driving a truck, down by the bay?

That someone was the wife of a priest who had died the day before. The email reads: Hi dear, just thought I’d send you a small note to tell you I’ve arrived safely. It’s pretty hot down here. I just thought you ought to know, since you’ll be arriving tomorrow.

1	Lifeguard with a little head  A lifeguard with a huge masculine body and a very small head (I mean unnaturally small) was patrolling the beach. Many people knew him When his head was normally sized but everyone was too scared to ask him what had happened... until Tim walked past him and said “hold up! Bob what happened to your head!?” Bob looked at Tim and said “you’re not going to believe me but, I was patrolling the beach just as I always do. Just past the flags I saw a woman thrashing around near the rocks and swam to save her, when I got there I realised that she was a mermaid and that her tail was stuck between two rocks. I quickly swam to the rocks and freed her tail, she was very happy and said that she would grant me one wish”... Bob just stared at Tim and Tim at Bob. Tim finally fed up with the silence screams “what the fuck did you wish for!?” Bob looks at Tim and with his tear filled beady little eyes whimpers “a little head”.  Edit: TLDR:lifeguard that has a very small head and a huge masculine body is asked what happened to his head. Lifeguard tells the story of how he saved a mermaid and she granted him one wish. He wished for “a little head”.

4	A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"   The first guy answers, "That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"   The policeman says, "Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile."  Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"  The second guy smiles, flips his hair and says, "Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"  The policeman angrily responds, "What's the matter with you two?!!? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?"  Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?   He quickly adds, "Think hard before giving me a stupid answer."  The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, "The suspect wears contact lenses."  The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.  "Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that."   He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.  "Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?"  "That's easy..." the third guy replied. "He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear."

4	A woman decides to have a face lift for her 50th birthday. She spends $15,000 and looks sensational. On her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper. Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”. ’About 32,’ is the reply.’  ‘Nope! I’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.  A little while later she goes into McDonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.  The girl replies, ‘I’d guess about 29.’ The woman replies with a big smile, ‘Nope, I’m 50.’  Now she’s feeling really good about herself. She stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.  She goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.  The clerk responds, ‘Oh, I’d say 30.’  Again she proudly responds, ‘I’m 50, but thank you!’  While waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.  He replies, ‘Lady, I’m 78 and my eyesight is going. Although, when I was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. It sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra Then, and only then I can tell you EXACTLY how old you are.’  They wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. She finally blurts out, ‘What the hell, go ahead.’  He slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. He bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. He pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.  After a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘Okay, okay.....How old am I?’  He completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘Madam, you are 50.’  Stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘That was incredible, how could you tell?’  ‘I was behind you at McDonalds’.

1	What could possibly be making such a seductive sound? A man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. He goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “My car broke down. Do you think I could stay the night?”  The monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. As the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. A sound unlike anything he’s ever heard before. The Sirens that nearly seduced Odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. He doesn’t sleep that night. He tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.  The next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.” Distraught, the man is forced to leave.  Years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.  The monks reply, “We can’t tell you. You’re not a monk.”  The man says, “If the only way I can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.”  The monks reply, “You must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. When you find these answers, you will have become a monk.” The man sets about his task.  After years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. A monk answers. He is taken before a gathering of all the monks.  “In my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, I traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: By design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. Only God knows what you ask. All a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.”  The monks reply, “Congratulations. You have become a monk. We shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.”  The monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “The sound is beyond that door.”  The monks give him the key, and he opens the door. Behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. The man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. And so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.  Finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. The sound has become very clear and definite. The monks say, “This is the last key to the last door.”  The man is apprehensive to no end. His life’s wish is behind that door!  With trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. Falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound……  But, of course, I can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk…  (h/t Morris Devereaux)

I’m going to take out my junk and he will bite down on it and still leave it completely unscathed. In return for this spectacle, you will all buy me a drink.”  The crowd murmurs their approval, so the cowboy unzips his jeans and brings out his junk. The alligator’s jaws open wide and snap down on it.  The crowd falls silent. The alligator’s jaws are clamped around the cowboy’s junk for a full minute. Finally, he grabs a wine bottle, bangs the alligator on the head and sure enough, his junk is completely unscathed. The crowd cheers.  The cowboy announces, “Now I will give $100 to anyone willing to try it!”  The patrons fall dead silent again. They steal glances around to see if anyone will dare.  Finally, a woman at the back raises her hand. “I’ll give it a go if you promise not to hit me on the head with a wine bottle.”

Bigger than normal donkey standards by at least half again and for some reason, the farmer felt he he just had to have him. Back at the farm however, there was a problem. When he tried to put the donkey into the stable, those huge ears touched the top of the doorway and he panicked and ran all over place, taking the farmer ages to calm him down enough to try again. Once again the same reaction, and every other time the farmer tried to stable him. Out of frustration, the farmer felt he had no choice but to hack a great chunk from the top of the doorway of his quite new stable. As he was angrily setting up his tools, his neighbour came by.  "What you be up to with that there saw, Bill?" he enquired.  "That bastard donkey's ears are too long." he spat. "I'll not get him bedded for the night until I cut damn near half my stable up, just to get him through the fucking door."  "Wouldn't it be easier to just dig a small trench in the doorway that you could walk him through?"  "Don't talk like a cunt!!" He snapped. "I've already told you it's his ears that are too long, not his fucking legs."

She looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. The man couldn´t be any happier. The devil says "Everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!"  As they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. He peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. There are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. Other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. A stench of sulfur is in the air.  Terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil "What is going on there?" The devil just shrugs and says: "Those are the christians, I don´t know why, but they prefer it that way".

After becoming very frustrated with the 'no haggle' attitude of one of the shopkeepers, the blonde shouted, 'Maybe I'll just go out and catch my own alligator so I can get a pair of shoes at a reasonable price!'

A man has an elephant that is getting too expensive to feed, so he puts an ad in the paper for a 50/50 contest.  20 dollars to enter, and if you can make the elephant jump, you win half the pot.  Many people try but nobody can do it.  One day, a slick guy in a Cadillac shows up puts money in the jar, goes to the trunk and pulls out a bat.

He pays his money, goes to the trunk, gets the bat and walks up to the elephant.  He asks the elephant "you remember me?" Elephant shakes his head yes.  Guy shows him the bat and asks "want this again?" Elephant shakes his head no.

Before he left, he told her that he did not have any cash with him, but that he would have his secretary write a check and mail it to her, calling the payment "RENT FOR APARTMENT."  On the way to his office he regretted it and decided it wasn't worth the price. So, he had his secretary send a check for $250 and enclosed the following note: "Dear Madam, Enclosed find check in the amount of $250 for rent of your apartment. I am not sending the amount agreed upon because when I rented the apartment I was under the impression that:  It had never been occupied. That there was plenty of heat. That it was small enough to make me cozy and feel at home. Last night, however, I found it had been previously occupied, that there was no heat, and it was entirely too large."  Upon receipt of the note, the girl immediately returned the check for $250 with the following note: Dear Sir, first of all, I cannot understand how you expect a beautiful apartment to remain unoccupied indefinitely. As for the heat, there is heat if you know how to turn it on. Regarding the space, the apartment is, indeed, of regular size, but if you don't have enough furniture to fill it, please don't blame the landlady!  Please be so kind as to send a check for the full amount of $500, or i'll be forced to contact your current landlady.

A Game Warden comes up behind them, taps them on the shoulder and says, “Excuse me, ladies, I’d like to see your fishing licenses.” “We don’t have any,” replied the first blonde. “Well, if you’re going to fish, you need fishing licenses,” said the Game Warden. “But officer,” replied the second blonde, “we aren’t fishing. We all have magnets at the end of our lines and we’re collecting debris off the bottom of the river.” The Game Warden lifted up all the lines and, sure enough, there were horseshoe magnets tied on the end of each line. “Well, I know of no law against it,” said the Game Warden. “Take all the debris you want.” And with that, he left. As soon as the Game Warden was out of sight, the three blondes started laughing hysterically. “What a dumb Fish Cop,” the second blonde said to the other two. “Doesn’t he know that there are steelhead trout in this river?”

1	A man went to his doctor because he had trouble peeing... He complained about how he had to struggle to even get a few drops out. Frowning for a brief moment, the doctor assures him that a simple surgery would fix the problem. The next day, the man returns to the hospital for the surgery and the doctor proceeds, the only issue being that the man's testicles would have to be temporarily extracted. The doctor thus removes the testicles and places them on an operating dish but carelessly leaves the door open and his dog comes in, sees the testicles and munches away. Horrified, the doctor thinks hard for a moment and then, kills the dog and extracts its testicles and puts them in the man without informing him. He completes the operation, stitches the patient back up and eventually sends him home . The next evening, while at home relaxing. The doctor receives a visitor which happens to be the man operated upon. Terrified that the man was coming to confront him, he asks weakly and timidly if everything was fine, to which the man responded with a big grin: "Oh never felt better doctor! I pee easily and freely and I owe it all to you!" The doctor let out a huge sigh of relief and was about to offer the man a drink when he was asked: " There's just one question I have for you Doc, why is it that whenever I pee, I have to raise a leg? "

Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said, “Watson, look up at the sky and tell me what you see.” Watson replied: “I see millions and millions of stars.” Holmes said: “And what do you deduce from that?” Watson replied, “Well, if there’s millions of stars, and if even a few of these have planets, it’s quite likely there are some planets like earth out there. And if there are a few planets like earth out there, there must be life.” And Holmes said, “Watson, you idiot, it means someone stole our tent.”
1	A guy dies and is met at the Pearly Gates by St. Peter... ... and St. Peter tells him, “Hang on a sec… getting into Heaven isn’t a big deal… I just need to find a good deed you've done in your life… and you’re in.”  And with that, St. Peter starts leafing through this guy’s Book of Life. It’s a thick book, but he’s not finding anything. He gets to the end, goes back to the beginning, is leafing thorugh random pages… but nothing.  “Jeez”, he says, “Crazy… I can’t find a single good thing you’ve ever done. Not a single good deed. This is really rare, but I guess it happens. Can you think of one? Anything?”  “Yeah”, says the guy, “The time I was driving along and saw this young woman stranded on the side of the highway… she had a flat tire and was having problems, so I stopped to help her. Does that count?”  “Yes”, St. Peter says, “It sure does. Weird I can’t find it… let me look again.”  “Not only that”, continues the guy, “but while I was changing the tire, a gang of bikers showed up. They threatened me and said they were going to take her with them. And I said ‘No way, I’m not letting that happen’, and I stood up to them. That has to count, right?”  “For sure”, says St. Peter, “It’s just so strange that I can’t find any of this. When did it happen?”  “About two minutes ago.”

2	A horse is sitting at home, bored, watching MTV... He's watching a heavy metal music video, and the guitarist plays an amazing solo. The horse says "that looks amazing, I want to do that!"  The horse goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. "Hi, I'd like to learn to play guitar." Says the horse.   "Sure," says the man on the phone. "Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."  "There's just one problem," says the horse. "I'm a horse."  "Not to worry," the man says. "We have new state of the art technology to teach horses. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."  Sure enough, the horse gets really good at the guitar and he can play that amazing solo. He wants to show his friends, so he picks up the phone and calls chicken.  "Hey Chicken, come over!" he says. Chicken comes over, watches horse play the guitar and thinks it's pretty cool. Chicken watches the music video and says "hey, that drum part is pretty cool, I want to learn to play that."  Chicken goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. "Hi, I'd like to learn to play the drums." Says the chicken.   "Sure," says the man on the phone. "Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."  "There's just one problem," says the chicken. "I'm a chicken."  "Not to worry," the man says. "We have new state of the art technology to teach chickens. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."  Sure enough, the chicken gets really good and begins to jam with the horse. Eventually, they think that something's missing. They watch the video again and realize they need a bass guitarist. They call their friend Cow and show them what they've been up to. Cow thinks it's pretty cool, and wants to learn how to play the bass guitar.  Cow goes to the phone book, looks up a music teacher and calls him. "Hi, I'd like to learn to play bass guitar." Says the cow.   "Sure," says the man on the phone. "Just come to your lesson and we'll get you started."  "There's just one problem," says the cow. "I'm a cow."  "Not to worry," the man says. "We have new state of the art technology to teach cows. You'll be playing like a pro in no time."  Sure enough, the cow gets really good at the bass and the animals have a nice band going.  One day, while they're practicing, a man walks by and hears them. He goes up to the animals and says "hey, you guys are pretty good! I'm from a record label, I'd like to sign you!"  The band records an album, puts out some singles and becomes a massive success. They go on a worldwide tour and make tons of money. Right before the last show of the tour, which is supposed to be in Vegas, Horse gets a call. His mother is in hospital.  Horse goes to visit her before the show while the rest of the band goes to Vegas to set up. It turns out that she's all good, it's just a cold. As horse is leaving the hospital, he gets another call. The private jet that was carrying the band and their producer crashed into the ocean, and there were no survivors.  Horse is devastated. All of his best friends are dead, he's out of a job and he's stuck with nowhere to go. He breaks down in tears and decides he'll drink himself to death.  So the horse walks into a bar.  The bartender asks, "why the long face?"

Please also include two pieces of burnt toast with Crisco spread on them instead of butter." The nurse is now confused as to why this man is ordering such a strange meal.

Who said 'Give me Liberty , or give me Death'?"  She saw a sea of blank faces, except for Chandrasekhar, who had his hand up:?'Patrick Henry, 1775'he said.  'Very good! Who said 'Government of the People, by the People, for the People, shall not perish from the Earth?''  Again, no response except from Chandrasekhar. 'Abraham Lincoln , 1863' said Chandrasekhar.  The teacher snapped at the class, 'Class, you should be ashamed. Chandrasekhar, who is new to our country, knows more about our history than you do.'  She heard a loud whisper: 'F\\*\\*\\*k the Indians,' 'Who said that?' she demanded. Chandrasekhar put his hand up. 'General Custer, 1862.'  At that point, a student in the back said, 'I'm gonna puke.'  The teacher glares around and asks 'All right! Now, who said that?' Again, Chandrasekhar says, 'George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991.'  Now furious, another student yells, 'Oh yeah? Suck this!'  Chandrasekhar jumps out of his chair waving his hand and shouts to the teacher, 'Bill Clinton, to Monica Lewinsky,1997'  Now with almost mob hysteria someone said 'You little shit. If you say anything else, I'll kill you.' Chandrasekhar frantically yells at the top of his voice, 'Michael Jackson to the child witnesses testifying against him, 2004.'  The teacher fainted. And as the class gathered around the teacher on the floor, someone said, 'Oh shit, we're screwed!' And Chandrasekhar said quietly, 'I think it was Lehmann Brothers, November 4th, 2008'.

When he finishes, he goes back to the bar and orders three more.  The bartender approached the cowboy and said, "You know, a mug goes flat after I draw it. It would taste better if you bought one at a time."   The cowboy replied, "Well, you see, I have two brothers. One is in Arizona , the other is in Colorado. When we all left our home in Texas , we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together. So I'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself."   The bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and left the cowboy to his tradition  The cowboy became a regular in the bar, and always drank his beers the same way. He orders three mugs and drinks them in turn. Then one day he came in and ordered just two mugs. All the regulars took notice and fell silent. When he walked back to the bar for the second round, the bartender said, "I don't want to intrude on your grief, but I wanted to offer my condolences on your loss."

"Oh, no, everybody's just fine," he explained, "It's just that my wife and I joined the Baptist Church and I had to quit drinking. It hasn't affected my brothers though."

1	Dead Crows Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.     However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.     MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. He very quickly concluded the cause: When crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.      They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout **"Cah"**, not a single one could shout **"Truck.**"

2	A woman was driving through a remote section of desert at night and was thoroughly lost. Suddenly, a coyote ran into the road ahead of her. Slamming on the brakes, the woman was astounded to see a man come running from out of the darkness toward the coyote. In one smooth motion, the strange man took his pants down, grabbed the coyote by it's back legs and began furiously sodomizing the poor creature. Shocked beyond words, the woman went around the man as quickly as possible and drove on.  Speeding toward some lights in the distance, she discovered a bar with a sheriffs car parked outside. "It figures", she thought, and resolved to go inside and file a complaint. On a rocking chair near the door, an old man was sitting and masturbating openly. Horrified, she stomped into the bar and straight away went up to the sheriff, who was sitting at the bar.   She shouted at the sheriff: "What sort of town are you running here?! You've got people running around the desert fucking coyotes, and- and just outside there was an old man masturbating openly! How can you explain this?!"  The sheriff sipped his beer and said, "Ah well, you can't expect him to catch a coyote at his age"

I’m not sure I’ll have time for that.” said Mick Jagger.  “Please Mr. Jagger, and I promise I won’t bother you ever again.”  “Okay, fine.”  Later on, during a break between songs, Mick Jagger got off stage and went over to the guy and his girlfriend.  “Hey buddy, how are you doing? I haven’t seen you in so long.” he told him.  And then our guy got all angry and shouted:  “Fuck off Mick, I’m not lending you any money ever again!”.

Moses says 'i'll take any bet you put up.' he says half serious. so jesus steps out of the boat and stands up on the water outside one foot at a time. he straightens up, takes one step, takes another, turns around, smiles, and then--  \\---he plummets to the bottom of the lake! he's drowning! bubbles are coming up there's nothing at the surface, so Moses breathes in and takes one of the oars and dips it into the water--he holds his arms out wide and two giant waves burst up and part the lake in front of the boat, he breathes out--and all the snapping turtles and perch and bass and sunnies are floppin around at the bottom of the lake floor with jesus right in the middle--he's coughing up algae and snot, getting his legs caught in the muck up to his knees, a couple of fishing lures hooked to his robe in different places. moses smiles, asks god for a little umph and is able to lift jesus back up with the oar's power into the boat, he returns the water back to normal, gently--all the animals are fine.   moses sits jesus down on the middle bench. jesus is hacking and burping with his head in his hands and when he's done he yells 'what the hell happened man?! what the hell?! i'm the son of god i am the lord of heavens & earth what is this shit?' moses shakes his head and he says   MY FRIEND, YOU DIDN'T HAVE HOLES IN YOUR FEET LAST TIME!

2	Golf Hooker  A man became an avid golfer. So much so that he'd never gotten to know a female well enough to even think about marriage.  As the years went by, he realized he'd probably never get married, since he sure wasn't giving up golf.    As it so happens, he finally did meet a wonderful woman, and in short order they grew very fond of each other. He kept asking himself: “Is this the one?”   One evening at a restaurant, he opened up to her. “As you have probably figured out, I've grown very fond of you, and have started to think about a future together”   She interrupted to say “I have been feeling the same was about us.”      He smiled at her and continued:  "I have a confession to make that I should have made before, but I was concerned that it might affect our relationship.”   "What is it?"     "I'm a golf fanatic," he said. "I think about golf constantly. I'll be out on the golf course just about every day, every holiday, just every chance I get. I try to play 36 holes each day, but if the weather is good, I'll try to pay even more.”   He finished with: “I thought you should know before we go any further.”   She pondered this for a moment and said, "I thank you for your honesty. Now in the same spirit of honesty, I should tell you that I've concealed something about my own past that you should know about. The truth is, "I'm a hooker."   There is a long pause, and her heart was sinking with every second of protracted silence.    She watched him fidget with his hands, and still there is silence.  She began to despair.  Finally, he picks his head and looks right at her: "That's not really a problem.  Just widen your stance a little, and overlap your grip, and that should clear it right up."

1	Farmer problems (long joke) There was a farmer, who owned a Datsun Ute. He used this Datsun for all his farm work, feeding the horses.. Throwing bails of hay out the back of it.. Carrying firewood and what not. When all of sudden one day, chug chug chug it breaks down.  So he decides to go back to the shed to grab his tractor and tow it back. He pulls apart his Datsun Ute and does all the fault finding and diagnostics you can imagine. He pulls apart the gearbox and finds a broken cog.  So he calls up the Datsun dealership and explains to him how his Datsun Ute broke down, and he needs a new cog for it. He asks if he could help him out. The dealership tells him "Yeh mate, I can get one in for ya but it's going to take about 6-8 weeks." The farmer says, "why so long? I really need the Datsun cog for my Datsun Ute." The man replies, "Yeh sorry mate, the parts coming from Japan, nothing I can do." The farmer says "fair enough" and hangs up the phone. He comes up with the idea to just fly over there himself and pick it up, as it's costing him money not having his Datsun ute running.  He buys a plane ticket to Japan expecting he's just going to get there and buy a Datsun cog and return home. He finally lands and makes his way to the Datsun factory. Out comes one of the workers and the farmer says to him, "Mate, I'm after a Datsun cog for my Datsun ute." The factory worker says "Yeh no worries, but we're a factory, you can't just buy one Datsun cog. You have to buy a 1000 Datsun cogs minimum." The farmer agrees and he takes a pallet of a 1000 Datsun cogs back onto the plane making his way home.  As the planes descending the planes to heavy for the landing gear and the flight attendants announce their going to throw out anything they deem as excessive. The flight crew are staring at a pallet of a 1000 Datsun cogs, thinking who would want a 1000, it's a Datsun.  So they decide to push it off the back of the plane. When at that moment the farmer comes racing in saying "stop, stop!". He reaches into the pile and grabs a Datsun cog out. And he's happy, as he got what he came for. So they push out the remainder, like 999 Datsun cogs, but let's just say a 1000, who's counting.  So you can imagine, a 1000 Datsun cogs are falling from the sky from a plane, what a sight that would be. 2 other farmers, Billy and Joel, sitting out on their deck under a tin roof see exactly that. Billy yells out, "Joel! Wake up! It's raining Datsun cogs!"

Accepting the explanation, the priest forgives the sailor and takes the fish back to church.  "Look at this huge fucker" says the priest, spotting the bishop.  "Language, please! this is God's house," replies the bishop.  "No, no that's what this fish is called, "says the priest.  "Oh," says the bishop, scratching his chin "I could clean that fucker and we could have it for dinner".  So the bishop takes the fish, cleans it, and brings it to the mother superior.  "Could you cook this fucker for dinner tonight?" he asks her.  "My, what language!" she exclaims, clearly shocked.  "No, sister that's what the fish is called - a fucker", says the bishop.  Satisfied with the explanation, the mother superior says, "Wonderful, I'll cook that fucker tonight, The Pope is coming for dinner!"  The fish tastes just great and The Pope asks where they got it.  "Well, I caught the fucker!" says the priest.  "And I cleaned the fucker!" says the bishop.  "And I cooked the fucker!" says the mother superior.  The Pope stares at them for a minute with a steely glaze, leans back on his chair, takes off his cap, puts his feet up on the table, pours himself a whiskey and says:" You know what?, You cunts are alright."
1	A man is driving down the road one day when his car breaks down in front of a monastery. He goes up to the monastery and before he can even ask for help, the monks invite him in, they feed him a delicious dinner, they let him sleep the night, and in the morning, before breakfast, they inform him that they fixed his car overnight.  But during the night, the man had heard a strange noise coming from deep within the monastery. The noise was beautiful and yet haunting— once he had heard it, he knew he wouldn’t be able to get it out of his head. And the man could not begin to identify in his mind what was making the noise. So in the morning, over breakfast, the man asks the monks:  “Hey, what was making that sound from within the monastery?”  “We’re very sorry,” they reply, “we cannot tell you, because you’re not a monk.”  After a moment of pause the man accepts this. “Well, fair enough, I guess. Thank you so much for everything you’ve done for me.” And, after the monks refuse to accept any form of payment for their hospitality, the man leaves.  One year later, to the day, the same man, driving the same car, at the same time of night, breaks down in front of the same monastery.  Everything happens as it had the year before. The monks invite him in, feed him, let him spend the night, fix the car, and overnight, the man hears the same sound coming from within the monastery. Hearing it again after all this time, the man now lays awake all night. It’s as if the sound is calling out to him. By the time morning comes, one thing is clear: the man will never be satisfied until he knows what the source of the sound was.  So in the morning he asks again. And again, the monks tell him that since he is not a monk, they cannot tell him.  “Alright,” he says, “you’ve interested me. What do I have to do to become a monk?”  “You have to go around the world,” they reply, “without using any type of vehicle that has an engine. And in your travels, you have to count the number of people you see. You do not have to count the number of people in the world— but you need to count the number of people you see, while you go around the world.”  The man sets off. He begins traveling immediately after finishing breakfast. Since he cannot use a vehicle with an engine, he figures that his best bet is to use a bicycle to travel the land distances, but the bulk of his journey would happen using a sail boat.  He plots his course, and then navigates it. And with every person he saw, he added to his count. Every person he passed while traveling on the road. Every person in every car that passed him. All the people in the port before he set sail. All the people in the port where he landed. And so on.  Finally, after a great deal of time spent traveling and counting people, he arrives back at the monastery. His car is still parked there. He walks right past it without casting it a second glance, and he knocks on the door of the monastery.  “Welcome home,” a monk greets him.  “I made the journey,” the man says, “I saw Four hundred and seventy nine thousand, seven hundred and sixty two people, including you.”  “Excellent,” says the monk, as he embraces the man and leads him into the monastery, “then you are home. You are a monk now. And as such...” the man pulls out a key which he carries on a necklace around his neck, “you can find what you sought.”  The monk hands the man the key and leads him to a wooden door. The door’s surface is worn, but strong. It has been the guardian of the source of the sound for a very long time. The man unlocks the door, and behind the door is a long hallway. Hundreds of yards long, so that it must go deep into the mountain that the monastery sits at the foot of. He begins to walk down it, then he starts to run. He’s almost there. He can hear the sound growing louder.  At the end of the hallway is a large, steel door. The kind of door that would secure a bank vault. The monk— who the man had not heard running behind him— tells the man the combination. Turn right five times and land on 47. Turn left four times, land on 97. Right three times to 62. Finally, left twice, landing on zero.  As he put in the combination he realized it was the same as the number of people he saw as he went around the world.  The locking mechanism clicks and the vault door unlocks. The man turns the handle and pulls back, revealing another, darker hallway. Halfway down this hallway, it opens up into a cavern. But through the cavern, there is a well lit and well worn path— worn by the feet of all those who have seen the source of the sound. The sound, which was growing louder with ever step. He was so close.  The man arrives at the end of the path. There was a round stone door— similar to the type of door that sealed Jesus’ tomb. The man goes to one side of the door and pushes with all the strength he has left just to make the door budge, but once he has it rolls the rest of the way to the side.  Exhausted, the man now staggers into yet another, much shorter hallway which is only about fifteen yards in length. At the end of this hallway is a curtain. The man peels the curtain to the side, and is amazed to find out what was making the noise.  But I can’t tell you what it was, because you’re not a monk.

But then, a moment later, the voice returns, this time offering, “You seem like a really cool guy!” Again, the man looks around, sees nothing, and returns to his drink, wondering if he should get checked out by a professional.

1	An American, a German and a Chinese got arrested consuming alcohol which is a severe offence in Saudi Arabia So for the terrible crime, they were all sentenced 20 lashes each of the whip.  As they were preparing for their punishment, the Sheik announced: "It's my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping .."  The German was first in line, he thought for a while and then said: " Please tie a pillow to my back .."  This was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes & the German had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain.  The Chinese was next up. After watching the German in horror he said smugly: " Please fix two pillows to my back."  But even two pillows could only take 15 lashes & the Chinese was also led away whimpering loudly.  The American was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the Sheik turned to him and said: " I like you Americans. For this, you may have two wishes !"  " Thank you, your Most Royal and Merciful Highness," American replied.  " In recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes."  " Not only are you an honourable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave. " The Sheik said with an admiring look on his face.  " If 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it.  " And what is your second wish? " the Sheik asked.  American smiled and said, " Tie the Chinese to my back!!! "

1	Not sure if this joke is originally from my language or if it is an old joke which is stolen then translated to my language but thought I’d share it Three man were lining up to heaven when st. peter explained that their death was not planned and that it has happened due to unforeseen and unknown circumstances. Because of this heaven wasn’t prepared for their coming and would need them to wait outside for a long time. However, pitying their early death, st. peter said he could make an exception for one person that have the most tragic death.  The first guy started telling his story, “I think i have the most tragic death. I was coming home when I found my wife naked in bed and knew that she had been cheating on me. When I searched for the guy I found him hanging on my balcony, so I smashed his finger with a hammer till he fall down. I saw that he landed is some bushes and was still alive, so I grabbed the nearest heaviest thing beside me and threw it at the man. After that, from the strain and stress, I died of a heart attack.”  The second guy then says “Your story just made mine even more tragic. I was cleaning my balcony when slipped and fall. Thinking that I managed to save my life by hanging on to a balcony ledge you proceeded to smash my fingers and made me fall. Not to mention you even threw a fridge on top of me. Killing me. All because you thought your wife was cheating.”  The third guy then speaks up “I think I’ll win. Both your stories just made mine the best. Imagine this, I was naked and cold and... is inside that fridge.”

1	A priest lived in a church with three nuns...    One evening the priest decided that he wanted to take a bath. He went to the washroom, filled the tub with water, and then undressed before he realized that he forgot to bring his soap.   He wraps himself in a towel around his waist and goes back to his room to retrieve his soap, grabbing an extra one just for some extra lather, and starts to head back to the washroom.   On his way, he hears his three nuns coming down the hallway about to round the corner. He didn't want the nuns to see him in such an unclothed state so he quickly jumps on a spot for a pedestal and positions himself to look like a statue of Jesus. During his haste, his towel falls and reveals his penis, but it's too late to retrieve it as the nuns have rounded the corner and are coming towards him.   As they pass by one of the nuns takes notice and says, "We seem to have gotten a new statue."   he gets closer and notices the penis and then states, "This seems to be a lever of some sort, I wonder what it does." So she pulls it, and the priest drops the soap.   The second nun exclaims "Oh! It's a soap dispenser! I'd like to have some soap too!"   So the second nun pulls his penis and he drops the second bar of soap.   The third nun reiterates the second about wanting some soap, so she pulls his penis.   She then turns to the other two nuns and says "Look! It's a lotion dispenser too!"
4	A doctor told a guy that masturbating before sex often helped men last longer during the act The man decided, "What the hell, I'll try it," He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it before he got home to his wife. He couldn't do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe. Finally, he realized his solution. On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck. Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to play with his unit. He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants. Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, "What?" He heard, "This is the police. What's going on down there?" The man replied, "I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted." The cop replied, "Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago."

1	There’s an unusual hospital where one of the treatments involves the female nurses taking the male patients home and sleeping with them.  For most of the patients, the treatment is very effective. But one day, into the hospital comes an odd patient who has the word “Shorty” tattooed on his penis. None of the nurses want anything to do with him.  Days go by and the poor man’s health doesn’t improve. So finally, this one nurse feels sorry for him and brings him home.  When she comes in the next morning, she is smiling and happy. The other nurses ask, “Why are you so happy? Weren’t you with the guy who has ‘Shorty’ tattooed on his penis?”  “Yes,” she says, “but when he became aroused, it said ‘Shorty’s Restaurant and Pizzeria.’”    “. . . established 1922.”    “. . . orders to take out.”    “. . . all baking done on premises.”    “. . . ask about our party platters.”

The wife switched off the lights, and curled up under the sheets, ready to go to sleep, just as the husband turned his bed lamp on to read a book.   As he started to read, he periodically reached over to his wife and fondled her pussy. He did this a few times, but only for very short intervals before returning to read his book.   The wife gradually became more and more aroused, assuming that her husband was in a playful mood and was seeking some encouragement before going further, got up and started stripping in front of him.   The husband looked up from his book, confused and asked, "Why are you taking off your clothes?"   His wife, stopping halfway through stripping, replied, "You were rubbing me downtown. I thought you wanted to get frisky."   The husband, even more confused, said, "No, no, not at all." His wife asked angrily, "Well, what the hell were you doing then!?"   "I was just wetting my fingers so I could turn the pages."

1	A Baptist preacher, a Methodist preacher, and a Presbyterian preacher lived in the same small town. The three were of similar age, and over the years, they and their wives became friends. All three retired within a few months of each other, and decided to rent an RV to drive across the country.  Only a few days into the trip, they were in a horrible accident that killed all six of them.  The Baptist preacher walks up to Saint Peter.  Saint Peter says "May I help you?"  The man replies, "Yes, I'm a Baptist preacher, just killed in a car accident, and my wife and I would like to get into Heaven now."  Saint Peter says "Well, I don't think there will be a problem, you being a man of the Word and all, but one thing I have to do before you can go in, I don't care who you are, Oral Roberts, Billy Graham, I have to check the Book of Life."  He opens the Book and flips through until he finds the man's name.  "Well, preacher, I don't know how to tell you this, but we've got you down for a cardinal sin."  The Baptist preacher is indignant. "What did I ever do?"  Saint Peter replies "It says here that all your life, you lusted in your heart for alcohol. You never DRANK any alcohol but you lusted for it and that's just as bad.  Says here you lusted so bad in your heart for alcohol, you wouldn't get married until you met a woman named Sherry.  I don't think we can let you in here."  The Methodist preacher walks up, Saint Peter looks for his name, cries out "I can't believe this, two men of the cloth in a row!"  The Methodist preacher is also indignant.  "What did I ever do?"  Saint Peter replies "It says here that all your life, you lusted in your heart for money. You never HAD much money but you lusted for it and that's just as bad.  Says here you lusted so bad in your heart for money, you wouldn't get married until you met a woman named Penny."  The Presbyterian preacher turns to his wife.  "Hell, Fanny, we might as well leave too."

5	The largest condom factory in the States burned down. President Trump was awakened at 4 am by the telephone.  "Sorry to bother you at this hour, Sir, but there is an emergency! I've just received word that the Durex factory in Washington has burned to the ground. It is estimated that the entire USA supply of condoms will be used up by the end of the week."  Trump: "Oh damn! The economy will never be able to cope with all those unwanted babies. We'll be ruined. We'll have to ship condoms in from Mexico."  Telephone voice says, "Bad idea... The Mexicans will have a field day with this one. We'll be a laughing stock. What about Canada?"  Trump: "Okay, I'll call Justin and tell him we need five million condoms, ten inches long and three inches wide. That way, they'll continue to respect us as Americans."  Three days later, a delighted President Trump ran out to open the first of the 10,000 boxes that had just arrived. He found it full of condoms, 10 inches long and 3 inches wide, exactly as requested... All colored with red maple leaves and in small writing saying: Made In Canada/Size: Small.     Edit: Didn't expect what I came back to. Thanks for the awards. Thanks for the upvotes.  Thanks for the comments.

I’m going to contact my ophthalmologist colleague and see if there’s anything she can do for them.”  The engineer said, “Why can’t they play at night?”

1	Religious Grandma Still Drives Dear Grand-daughter,  The other day I went up to our local Christian book store and saw a 'Honk if you love Jesus' bumper sticker.  I was feeling particularly sassy that day because I had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting.  So, I bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.  Boy, am I glad I did; what an uplifting experience that followed.  I was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the Lord and how good he is, and I didn't notice that the light had changed.  It is a good thing someone else loves Jesus because if he hadn't honked, I'd never have noticed.  I found that lot of people love Jesus!  While I was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, 'For the love of God!'  'Go! Go! Go! Jesus Christ, GO!'  What an exuberant cheerleader he was for Jesus!  Everyone started honking!  I just leaned out my window and started waving and smiling at all those loving people.  I even honked my horn a few times to share in the love!  There must have been a man from Florida back there because I heard him yelling something about a sunny beach.  I saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air.  I asked my young teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant.  He said it was probably a Hawaiian good luck sign or something.  Well, I have never met anyone from Hawaii, so I leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign right back.  My grandson burst out laughing.  Why even he was enjoying this religious experience!!  A couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me.  I bet they wanted to pray or ask what church I attended, but this is when I noticed the light had changed.  So, grinning, I waved at all my brothers and sisters, and drove on through the intersection.  I noticed that I was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and felt kind of sad that I had to leave them after all the love we had shared.  So I slowed the car down, leaned out the window and gave them all the Hawaiian good luck sign one last time as I drove away.   Praise the Lord for such wonderful folks!!  Love,   Grandma

Joey is called in to see the recruiter first, and after about 10 minutes in the room, he comes out elated. "I got the job!". Frank congratulates him and steps in to the recruiter's office.  After a brief introduction Frank is asked to describe his last job. "I worked at a garment factory, where I sewed the crotches into women's panty hose." the recruiter pauses before answering and respectfully says "I'm sorry, I don't think we have any jobs that would suit you." Frank stiffens, and says "Now hold on a minute! Joey worked there for five years too, and you just gave him a job."  The recruiter says "Well that's because he has some solid  engineering and maintenance skills. He's a diesel fitter".  Frank says "That's right, he was quality control. I'd sew the crotches, pass them to Joey, he'd stick an arm in each leg, stretch 'em over his head and say "Yeah dees'll fit 'er"".

1	The Jewish Salesman [Long] A fleeing Taliban terrorist, desperate for water, was plodding through the Afghan desert when he saw something far off in the distance. Hoping to find water, he hurried toward the mirage, only to find a very frail little old Jewish man standing at a small makeshift display rack - selling ties.              The Taliban terrorist asked, "Do you have water?" The Jewish man replied, "I have no water. Would you like to buy a tie? They are only $5." The Taliban shouted hysterically, "Idiot Infidel! I do not need such an over-priced western adornment - I spit on your ties. I need water!”   "Sorry, I have none - just ties - pure silk - and only $5."              "Pahh! A curse on your ties, I should wrap one around your scrawny little neck and choke the life out of you but... I must conserve my energy and find water!"              "Okay," said the little old Jewish man, “It does not matter that you do not want to buy a tie from me or that you hate me, threaten my life and call me infidel. I will show you that I am bigger than any of that. If you continue over that hill to the east for about two miles, you will find a restaurant. It has the finest food and all the ice-cold water you need... Go In Peace."              Cursing him again, the desperate Taliban staggered away over the hill. Several hours later he crawled back, almost dead and gasped...               "THEY WON'T LET ME IN WITHOUT A TIE!"
3	I decided to ruin my friend’s proposal to someone else, so here’s what happened I think the title sounds worse than it really is. My (24M) best friend (24M) Hugh was planning to propose to his girlfriend Samantha (25F) by recreating some of the moments from their early dates. This included watching the Pixar movie Up and going rock climbing at an indoor gym, among other things. I don’t have anything against Sam – she’s an ok looking girl, but Hugh’s last girlfriend (Trish) was his soulmate. She could probably be a model if she really wanted to. They broke up because she moved away for work, but what he didn’t know was that Trish was moving back for a new job.  I thought he would be thrilled when I told him but before I could, he told me that he was going to propose to Sam. I figured that if Hugh dumped Sam for Trish, people would hate Trish for being a homewrecker, but if I could break up Hugh and Sam, then Hugh and Trish could get together without any guilt.  Over the last few days Hugh has been asking to borrow my copy of Up and I didn’t want to say no, so I just kept saying “I’ll look for it”. Then things exploded yesterday. I was hanging out with Hugh and Sam when suddenly he surprised everyone by suggesting that we all go rock climbing at the gym that night. My stomach sank. Hugh must have said something to Sam because the entire drive there she kept harassing me about lending my DVD to Hugh. I don’t know if she knew everything or just suspected it. Hugh was mid-climb on a wall when Sam left to go to the bathroom. While she was gone, Hugh said that he was going to pop the question when she got back and he wanted me to lower him to the ground where he would land on one knee and pull the ring out of his pocket. I admit that I panicked and didn’t know what to do. Two seconds later Sam is back and the first thing she starts yammering on about is the DVD. She’s just chirping in my ear, meanwhile Hugh is at the top of the wall yelling at me to lower him down, so she also starts shouting at me to lower him down. That’s when I just snapped and yelled loud enough for everyone in the gym to freeze in place. I finally had enough and I looked Sam in the eyes and said, “I’m never going to give Hugh Up. I’m never going to let Hugh down.”
2	Kim Jong Un was sitting in his office wondering whom to irritate next when his telephone rang. "Hallo, Mr. Kim!", a heavily accented voice said. "This is Paddy down at the Harp Pub in County Sligo, Ireland. I am ringing to inform you that we are officially declaring war on you!"  "Well, Paddy," Kim replied, "This is indeed important news! How big is your army?"  "Right now," said Paddy, after a moment's calculation, "there is meself, me cousin Sean, me next door neighbour Seamus, and the entire dart team from the pub. That makes eight!"  Kim paused. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have one million men in my army waiting to move on my command."  “Jesus" said Paddy. "I'll have to call you back!"  Sure enough, the next day, Paddy called again. "Mr. Kim, the war is still on! We have managed to acquire some infantry equipment!"  "And what equipment would that be, Paddy?" Kim asked. "Well, we have two combines, a bulldozer, and Murphy's farm tractor."  Kim sighed. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 16,000 tanks and 14,000 armoured personnel carriers. Also, I've increased my army to 1-1/2 million since we last spoke."  "Holy shite!" said Paddy. "I'll get back to you."  Sure enough, Paddy rang again the next day. "Mr. Kim, the war is still on! We have managed to get ourselves airborne! We've modified Harrigan's ultra-light with a couple of shotguns in the cockpit, and four boys from the Shamrock Pub have joined us as well!"  Kim was silent for a minute and then cleared his throat. "I must tell you, Paddy, that I have 10,000 bombers and,10,000 fighter planes. My military complex is surrounded by laser-guided, surface-to-air missile sites. And since we last spoke, I've increased my army to TWO MILLION!"  "Ah bollix!", said Paddy, "I'll have to ring you back."  Sure enough, Paddy called again the next day. " G’ mornin' Mr. Kim! I am sorry to tell you that we have had to call off the war."  "I'm sorry to hear that," said Kim "Why the sudden change of heart?"  "Well," said Paddy, "we've all had a long chat over a lot of pints, and decided there's no feckin way we can feed two million prisoners."
1	Since we're doing translated jokes: here's a Greek one my father used to tell  An old man had a donkey that helped him with his daily duties. As the times got harder, the old man realized that he needed to do something about his financial situation. He had the idea to gradually reduce the amount of food he gave to the donkey.  Every day the meals of the donkey got smaller and smaller. A month has passed and the old man stopped feeding the donkey entirely. The poor animal died obviously.  Upon finding the dead donkey the old man exclaimed regretfully: "What terrible luck, as soon as that ass learned not to need any food it died!".

"Before God even created Adam, he planted a garden for Adam to live in. That makes agriculture the oldest career."  "Both of you are wrong," said the engineer. "Engineering is the oldest career because God created an entire universe out of nothing but pure chaos."  "Ha ha! I win!" taunted the lawyer.  "What makes you say that?" asked the surgeon.

2	The Hunter. There was a big game hunter in a bar in Africa. He was on a safari vacation with his wife. He was very good as a hunter.   While in the bar, he boasted that he could tell any animal and how it was killed by the feel of the pelt and the bullet hole. And he could do it blindfolded.   Of course, no one believed him. So they bet drinks, blindfold him, and bring the first pelt.   He feels it, ponders a moment, and says, "Lion, killed with a 30-06."  The others are amazed. Double or nothing they say. Another round of drinks and another pelt are brought. "Rhino, killed with a 45-70," he proclaims. The patrons are again amazed at his accuracy.    This goes on for several more rounds.

Now the priest is amazed that God has answered his humble prayer, and so what does he say?  "Praise the Lord!"

One, with a sign reading *It's time to GO!,* spotted them and quickly approached.  "Excuse me ma'am, can you spare a moment to take a look at some alarming literature and help support our cause?" he half-shouted at her.

Did you know that the dirt we live in,  that we *raise our children* in, contains magnesium and aluminum? And God knows what else!"  Again, she politely but firmly shook her head, pulling her daughter along as the man shouted after her, "You owe it to your little girl to evacuate *now!!"*  After they gained some distance, the young ant looked up worriedly at her mother. "Was that man right, Mommy? Are we in danger?"  The mother smiled. "No sweetheart, don't worry. Just because they use big words to try to scare us, doesn't mean the Ant Evacs movement has any idea what it's talking about."

The professor continues, "Logic will also tell me that since you have a yard, you also own a house."  Impressed, the redneck says, "Amazin!"  "And since you own a house, logic dictates that you have a wife."  "That's Betty Mae! This is incredible!" The redneck is obviously catching on.

1	True story ( I hope you see the humour) Back in the 50’s in Sou’West Nova Scotia the roads were not very good and the fog was always very thick which made driving difficult for even the best drivers. My father at 17 was in the Canadian Navy, got drunk, got into a fight and landed himself in jail. This was about an hours drive from where my grandparents lived. They got word of what happened and set out to pick him up. On their way home it got dark and the fog was ever so thick. My grandfather was not a good driver at the best of times and the conditions on this night drove his anxiety through the roof. He had a death grip on the steering wheel with white knuckles that my dad said illuminated the interior of the car. He had been following a larger vehicle for about 30 minutes with nowhere to pass and the leading vehicle was going quite slow. Eventually the vehicle he was following stopped and just sat there.

1	Three men were at the gates of heaven There was only room for one person. St Peter asked each of them how they died, and the best story got through.  Man 1: I was adamant my wife was cheating. I came up to my apartment on the 24th floor and walked in, only to find my wife by herself. I was pleasantly surprised until I saw a man hanging off the edge of the balcony by just his fingers. I went over to him with a hammer and hit his hands until he let go. He fell in some bushes, and was still alive, so I grabbed my fridge and lifted it over the edge so it would fall on him. And after all that heavy lifting, I died of a heart attack.  “Oh that is terrible”, said St Peter as he turned to the next man, “what about you?”  Man 2: well I was on my 25th floor balcony doing some yoga and I fell over the edge! I was hanging on by just my fingers when I saw a man coming over, I was so relieved! But then he started hammering my fingers and I fell in a bush. I was alive but very sore. He then threw a fridge over the edge on to me, and here I am”  “That is just terrible,” said St Peter. “What about you?” He asked man number 3.  Man 3: “Well I was hiding in a fridge”

A guy lost his penis in an accident and there were no suitable donors, so the only available option to the surgeon was to attach a baby elephant's trunk.  After the surgery and healing process, the guy is ready to start dating again.  He's out on his 1st date since the accident and while at the dinner table, the trunk comes out of his pants and starts sniffing around on the table and after finding a roll, it disappears back under the table.  His date sits there astonished while the guy tries to act like he didn't see it.  Then the trunk does the same thing again, grabbing a roll and dropping under the table.  His date says "That's amazing!  Can you do it again?"  Guy says "Probably, but I don't want another roll stuffed up my ass."   Credit: u/my_brain_tickles
4	The prostitutes operation... An old prostitute tells her plastic surgeon that she wants her vaginal lips reduced in size because they were too loose and floppy. Out of embarrassment she insisted that the surgery be kept a secret and the surgeon agreed.  Awakening from the anesthesia after the surgery she found 3 roses carefully placed beside her on the bed.  Outraged, she immediately calls in the doctor, "I thought I asked you not to tell anyone about my operation!"  The surgeon told her he had carried out her wish for confidentiality and that the first rose was from him: "I felt sad because you went through this all by yourself."  "The second rose is from my nurse. She assisted me in the surgery and empathized because she had the same procedure done some time ago."  "And what about the third rose?" she asked.  "That's from a man upstairs in the burn unit. He wanted to thank you for his new ears."

1	The Beggar Girl In the beginning of the 20th century, a young girl called Edit left her home country of Sweden, and crossed the Ocean to make a new life in America. Unfortunately, it did not go all that well, and she found herself soon homeless, begging for food or money to survive.  She used to occupy a street next to a theater; not because it meant hefty handouts, but because it was a place where no other beggars or police bothered her; every night, a new crowd came to see a show, and the cute young girl found just enough mercy to survive. In fact, she did so well, that she decided to afford herself a small piece of cake every tuesday - just to keep her spirits up.  One tuesday, she could not get a break. Looked like she will go without cake this week. Then, a strange looking gentleman stopped near her. He soon heard her story, and decided to share his fortune.  Gentleman: I work as a magician in the touring show - today we performed here. Some nights, our guests want to gamble with us afterwards, and I make sure to bring home more than I came with. I try to keep it moderate - but today, this obnoxious drunk was loaded, so I emptied his pockets. Here, take this precious coin.  Edit: Thanks for gold, kind stranger! Happy cake day to me!

1	4 horny nurses were tending to a dying patient... But no matter what they did, and all they tried, he ended up dying.  "That's so sad!" said the first nurse.  "Poor man!" said the second.  "I cannot believe this!" said the third.  "WHY!?!?" said the fourth.  After the short while, the four horny nurses got even hornier. They eyed the dead body, which was now naked, and the man's 10 inch penis is perfect view. The first nurse could not take it anymore, and went and proceeded to ride the hell out of the man.  The second nurse then broke as well. She also sat on the man's now erect cock and rode him.  The third nurse proceeded to do the exact same as the first two.  But the fourth nurse hesitated. "Go on ahead, now." said the first nurse. "It feels really good."  The fourth nurse replied "But I'm on my period..." Eventually, she caved in, and also had a blast.  10 minutes later, the man woke with a jolt and seemed to be fully aware of what had happened.  The first nurse spoke for the four and said, "Sorry, we thought you were dead."  Without skipping a beat, the man replied, "I was, but with 3 jump-starts and a blood transfusion, I feel better than ever!"

1	The Jazz Pianist An Michelin star restaurant is looking for a pianist to entertain customers while they dine. The owner has been auditioning for weeks, but has had no luck finding someone suitable. One day, a guy called John comes in and says "Hi there, I'm here about the pianist position."   The manager replies "That's fantastic, do you mind sitting at the piano and showing me what you can do?"   So John sits at the piano and starts to play. Out comes one of the most subtle and beautiful pieces of music the manager has heard in his life. Stunned at the end of the performance he says "That's absolutely wonderful, I love jazz, but I've never heard that piece before"   John replies "Oh it's a piece that I wrote myself, I call it 'Your daughter's tits were hanging out, so i slapped them with my cock'."   The manager is visibly taken aback, turning bright red, but still enthused by the music he stammers "Oh, err right... urr, could you play another?"   The pianist resumes playing, and yet again plays an absolutely magical piece of music.   The manager says "Incredible! But... what do you call this one...?"   Enthusiastically John replies "Oh, I call that one 'I'm going to stick my tongue up your arse and tickle your colon'."   Shocked and struggling to find words, the manager says to him "Ok, look, you're hired. You're clearly gifted and everything I've been looking for... but please, with respect, promise me, you won't let the clients know the names of your songs, the titles won't go down well  in an establishment like this."   So John agrees and starts work that night.   A few weeks later, the buzz about the restaurant's new pianist is incredible. The restaurant is packed every night and its almost impossible to get a reservation.   One evening, the pianist reaches the mid-point of his set, telling the diners that it is time for him to take a short comfort break, but he will return shortly.   As John walks back towards his piano through the packed restaurant, the manager, in a fluster, swiftly pulls him aside and exclaims "John! Do you know.. your dick is dangling out of your trousers, practically the whole fucking room can see it?!"   "Know it?!" John replies... "I fucking wrote it!"

1	The Spitfire Pilot A World War II Spitfire pilot is speaking in a church and reminiscing about his war experiences.  "In 1942," he says, "the situation was really tough. The Germans had a very strong air force. I remember," he continues, "one day I was protecting the bombers and suddenly, out of the clouds, these fokkers appeared."  There are a few gasps from the parishioners, and several of the children began to giggle.  "I looked up, and realized that two of the fokkers were directly above me. I aimed at the first one and shot him down. By then, though, the other fokker was right on my tail."  At this point, several of the elderly ladies of the church were blushing with embarrassment, the girls were all giggling and the boys laughing loudly.  The pastor finally stands up and says, "I think I should point out that 'Fokker' was the name of a German-Dutch aircraft company, who made many of the planes used by the Germans during the war."  "Yes, that's true," says the old pilot, "but these fokkers were flying Messerschmitts."

A third man walks in and the bartender asks what he would like.

The bartender sets an apple down, and the man takes it and bites into it, but immediately spits it out. “That tastes like shit!” He yells. The bartender just looks at him and says “turn it around”

1	She’s from Minsk A small, tight knit, Russian village buys their milk from the neighboring town. Eventually they realize they should pool their resources and buy a cow for the town.   They all gather their money, some put more, some less, whatever they can afford. Now they have 800 roubles, but to buy a cow from Moscow a cow costs 900 roubles, but a cow from Minsk, costs 700 roubles. So off to Minsk the town elders go. They return with a great cow.   The cow produces plenty of milk for the whole town, and everyone is happy and well nourished! They even sell the excess to the neighboring town.   The town  loves the cow and want to breed her and have so her calves will nourish the village.   So off to market the village elders go again, and they bring back a prize bull to mate with the cow.   They put them together in a beautiful pasture and the bull approaches the cow, but the cow moves away, and is not interested. The bull tries again from a different angle but still the cow rebuffs him. For hours the bull tries to mount the cow at the top of the field, the bottom of the field and the middle of the field but to no avail.   The town elders do not know what to do, so they call a local rabbi to help them with their problem.   They explain their story to the rabbi, they tell him all the details and ask him what to do.   The rabbi thinks for a while, he strokes his beard. Then asks the elders a question.   “Your cow, is she from Minsk?”  The elders are amazed! “Amazing!! You are truly a wise Rabbi. How did you know she is from Minsk?!”  And the rabbi replies,   “ahhh, well my... wife, she is from Minsk also…”

2	A female student was walking towards her locker when she noticed a post-it-note on the locker door. She looked at it and it was the classic “why did the chicken cross the road?” joke. She didn’t really laugh as she heard it a million times, so she crumpled it up and threw it in the back of her locker.   The next day, another note was posted onto her locker and it read the *same* joke! She was slightly annoyed, but it didn’t really matter at this point. She crumpled it up and went about her day.   The third day, yet another note was posted onto her locker door and as expected, it had the same old joke on it. She was growing irritated and ripped it up before throwing it in the trash.   Later that day, she has talking to one of her Senior friends at lunch, and she mentions these notes she has gotten for 3 days now. Her friends laughs and says “Oh, you’re getting them now?”  She was very confused now, and asked her friend “What do you mean? Do other people get these notes?”  Her friend explained the whole thing. “You see, there is this weird kid that puts the same joke on different lockers using a post-it, and watches them find it. If they read it, he puts the same note up the next day. If they don’t read it, he gives up and goes onto the next person.”    At this point, the girl starts to laugh and says “Are you serious? This can’t be real!”  Her friend laughs and says, “Once you have Read It, it’s just re-post after re-post”.

2	Penis study... I haven't seen this one in +20 years so here goes..   PENIS STUDY    Several years ago, Great Britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft.  The study took two years and cost over $180,000.00  The results of the study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.    After the results were published, Germany decided to conduct their own study on the same subject.  They were convinced that the results of the British study were flawed.  After three years of research and a cost in excess of $250,000.00, they concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex.    When the results of the German study were released, Canada decided to conduct their own study.  The Canucks didn't really trust the British or German studies.  So, after nearly three days of intensive research and a cost of around $25 bucks and a case of beer, the Canadian study was complete and came to the conclusion that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off the end and hitting you in the face.      ------------------------------

The lawyer's a little taken aback, but keeps his cool and says, "Yes, we handle divorces here. It's one of our services, and we can do this. From the looks of things, it would appear you want to arrange something amicable. Well, that's great, and I can help you with that."  The elderly couple appears pleased.  But the lawyer's brow furrows a bit, and he says, "I hope you won't mind my getting personal right out of the gate here, but... I have to ask... how old are you?"  The man says, "I'm 96, and my wife is 91."  The lawyer chews on this for a second. He then says, "I hope you won't mind my mentioning this, but I have to say, I've never seen... I mean, it's most unusual that..." Then he blurts out, *"Why did you wait so long?"*  And the wife answers this one, saying, "We thought it'd be best to wait 'til the children had died."

1	The Twelve Thank You Notes Of Christmas Dec 25  My dearest darling Edward,  What a wonderful surprise has just greeted me! That sweet partridge, in that lovely little pear tree; what an enchanting, romantic, poetic present! Bless you, and thank you.  Your deeply loving,  Emily  Dec 26  Beloved Edward,  The two turtle doves arrived this morning, and are cooing away in the pear tree as I write. I'm so touched and grateful!  With undying love, as always,  Emily  Dec 27  My darling Edward,  You do think of the most original presents! Who ever thought of sending anybody three French hens? Do they really come all the way from France? It's a pity we have no chicken coops, but I expect we'll find some. Anyway, thank you so much; they're lovely.  Your devoted Emily  Dec 28  Dearest Edward,  What a surprise! Four calling birds arrived this morning. They are very sweet, even if they do call rather loudly - they make telephoning almost impossible - but I expect they'll calm down when they get used to their new home. Anyway, I'm very grateful, of course I am.  Love from Emily  Dec 29  Dearest Edward,  The mailman has just delivered five most beautiful gold rings, one for each finger, and all fitting perfectly! A really lovely present! Lovelier, in a way, than birds, which do take rather a lot of looking after. The four that arrived yesterday are still making a terrible row, and I'm afraid none of us got much sleep last night. Mother says she wants to use the rings to "wring" their necks. Mother has such a sense of humor. This time she's only joking, I think, but I do know what she means. Still, I love the rings.  Bless you,  Emily  Dec 30  Dear Edward,  Whatever I expected to find when I opened the front door this morning, it certainly wasn't six socking great geese laying eggs all over the porch. Frankly, I rather hoped that you had stopped sending me birds. We have no room for them, and they've already ruined the croquet lawn. I know you meant well, but let's call a halt, shall we?  Love,  Emily  Dec 31  Edward,  I thought I said NO MORE BIRDS. This morning I woke up to find no more than seven swans, all trying to get into our tiny goldfish pond. I'd rather not think what's happened to the goldfish. The whole house seems to be full of birds, to say nothing of what they leave behind them, so please, please, stop!  Your Emily  Jan 1  Frankly, I prefer the birds. What am I to do with eight milkmaids? And their cows! Is this some kind of a joke? If so, I'm afraid I don't find it very amusing.  Emily  Jan 2  Look here, Edward,  This has gone far enough. You say you're sending me nine ladies dancing. All I can say is, judging from the way they dance, they're certainly not ladies. The village just isn't accustomed to seeing a regiment of shameless viragos, with nothing on but their lipstick, cavorting round the green, and it's Mother and I who get the blame. If you value our friendship, which I do (less and less), kindly stop this ridiculous behavior at once!  Emily  Jan 3  As I write this letter, ten disgusting old men are prancing up and down all over what used to be the garden, before the geese and the swans and the cows got at it. And several of them, I have just noticed, are taking inexcusable liberties with the milkmaids. Meanwhile the neighbors are trying to have us evicted. I shall never speak to you again.  Emily  Jan 4  This is the last straw! You know I detest bagpipes! The place has now become something between a menagerie and a madhouse, and a man from the council has just declared it unfit for habitation. At least Mother has been spared this last outrage; they took her away yesterday afternoon in an ambulance. I hope you're satisfied.  Jan 5  Sir,  Our client, Miss Emily Wilbraham, instructs me to inform you that with the arrival on her premises at 7:30 this morning of the entire percussion section of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, and several of their friends, she has no course left open to her but to seek an injunction to prevent you importuning her further. I am making arrangements for the return of much assorted livestock.  I am, Sir, yours faithfully,  G. Creep  Attorney at law

1	Senior Sex [NSFW] Husband leans over and asks his wife, "Do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? We went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and I made love to you." Yes, she says, "I remember it well." OK, he says, "How about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?" "Oh Jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!" A police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, I've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. I'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. So he follows them.  The elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. Finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence The old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. As she leans against the fence, the old man moves in.. Then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. This goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. Finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.  The policeman is amazed. He thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know. After about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggle to their feet and put their clothes back on. The policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, I've got to ask them what their secret is. So, as the couple passes, he says to them, "Excuse me, but that was something else. You must've had a fantastic sex life together. Is there some sort of secret to this?" Shaking, the old man is barely able to reply, "Fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence."

2	A programmer and an engineer  A Programmer and an Engineer are sitting next to each other on a very long flight from LA to NY. The Programmer leans over to the Engineer and asks if he would like to play a fun game. The Engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. The Programmer persists and explains that the game is really easy, and a lot of fun! He explains "I ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5." Again ,the Engineer politely declines and tries to get some sleep.  The Programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, "OK, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if I don't know the answer, I will pay you $50!!!!!" This catches the Engineer's complete attention, and he sees no end to this torment unless he plays, so he agrees to the game.  The Programmer asks the first question. "What is the distance from the earth to the moon?" The Engineer doesn't say a word, reaches in to his wallet, pulls out a $5 and hands it to the Programmer.  Now, it is the Engineer's turn. He asks the Programmer: "What goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?"  The Programmer looks at him with a puzzled look. He takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. He taps into the Airphone with his modem and searches the Net and the Library of Congress. Frustrated, he sends E-mail to all his co-workers and friends he knows. All to no avail. After an hour, he wakes the Engineer and hands him $50.  The Engineer politely takes the $50, and turns away to go back to sleep. The Programmer, more than a little miffed, shakes the Engineer and asks, "Well, so what IS the answer?"  Without a word, the Engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the Programmer $5 and goes back to sleep

1	This joke was originally written in Klingon; I hope I've got the translation right... A new prisoner named Andy arrived at the prison.  Andy had never been in prison before, so everything was new and strange.    Before long he met Bob, who sort of showed him around, introduced him to a few other prisoners, and helped him start to learn the ropes.      That evening, when they were all locked in their cells, somebody shouted "TWENTY THREE".  Andy started trying to imagine what that was about.  Several other prisoners started laughing and chuckling, and pretty soon it quieted down.     A while later, anothet prisoner called out "_Ninety Seven_" and a bunch of prisoners started laughing.  Andy was wondering if it has something to do with cell #s, or prisoner IDs, or what.    Just as the laughing was dying down, another prisoner said "fIfTy fIvE" and almost immediately another prisoner said "__56?__"  All the prisoners were laughing louder then they had yet, and Andy was still clueless.    As soon as it had quieted down enough, Andy called out "Bob, it's Andy. Hey, what's with people calling these numbers, and everybody laughing about them?"    Bob replied "Ah I should have told you earlier.  Most of us have already been here a long time, and are going to be here for life.  To pass the time, we love to tell jokes.  After a while though, we've all heard them all enough to have memorized them.  So, we assigned all the funny jokes numbers, and when we want to tell a joke, we just tell the number."  Andy thought for a second and said: "yes, I get it.  That makes sense.  Hey, do you think I can try telling a joke?"  "Sure, why not.  They're all funny; just tell which number you want to."    Andy said (loud enough so everybody around could hear) "87"    Nobody laughed.  There were even sounds from some cells of prisoners being a little unhappy, like grunts and groans.  Andy felt really embarrassed, and clueless again.  He said "Bob, what went wrong?  Wasn't that a good joke?"  Bob replied "the joke you told wasn't the problem; it's a funny joke, like I said before.  The problem is _how_ you told it."

Where are you?"     "In heaven", replies Joe. "I have some really good news and a little bad news."     "Tell me the good news first," says Mike.

Better still, it's always spring time and  it never rains or snows. And best of all, we can play football all we  want, and we never get tired."     That's fantastic," says Mike.

The card means I am allowed to go WHEREVER I WISH on any agricultural land. No questions asked or answered.  Have I made myself clear? Do you understand?'  The old farmer nodded politely and went about his farm chores. Later, the old farmer heard loud screams and saw the Water Rep running for the fence and close behind was the farmer's huge-horned prize bull. The bull was gaining on the Water Rep with every step. The Rep was clearly terrified, so the old farmer immediately threw down his tools, ran to the fence and shouted out.....  'Your card! Your card! Show him your card!'

1	A close shave A man dressed impeccably, in the finest Italian suit, a silk tie and matching leather shoes walked into a shabby barbershop and enquired apprehensively.  "I have a very important meet in an hour and I need the closest shave possible, I do not want a hint of growth anywhere. Do you think you can do it without butchering my face?"  Not batting an eyelid, the old barber kept sharpening his blade and replied, "Young man, I have given such a shave to many a man in this town. I've honed my skill for the past 50 years and I am a master at what I do."  Satisfied, the gentleman removed his jacket ans sank into the tattered chair which had evidently seen many a man's posterior before. The barber went inside and returned with a red ball  " Place this in your mouth so that your cheeks are stretched taut for my blade to shave off the tiniest wisp of hair off your face."  "Interesting", thought the man and willingly complied with the instruction and kept the ball in his mouth grimacing and holding still throughout the shave. While the barber was finishing off with the shave, he had a hiccup and swallowed the ball whole.  Begrudgingly he found himself running his hands over his chin  over and over again but couldn't find any sign of roughness. Satisfied with the old barber's work he said "I am sorry about the ball, is there anything I can do about it?"  The barber continued washing his blade and replied, "No big deal, you can bring it back tomorrow morning like everyone else."

1	A guy walks into a bar He sits down and orders a scotch, he takes a few sips and notices a jar filled with 20 dollar bills on the counter. He asks the bartender, " what's with the jar?" The bartender replies, "you put in a 20 to enter, if you complete the 3 challenges I give you, you get all the money in the jar." The guy says, " ok you git my attention, what are the challenges?" The bartender says, "first, you see that guy outside?" The man turns around to see a huge muscular man outside. "He's and asshole, I want you to knock him out. Second, my dogs in back, he's a mean son a bitch, hell bite your hand off, he's got a bad tooth, I need you to pull it. Third, my mom's upstairs, old but nice lady, she hasn't had a good time in forever, I need you to go and please her. And those are the tasks." The man pounds the scotch and says, "fuck it, I'm in." He puts a $20 in the jar and walks outside, walks up to the man and with a strong lucky blow, knock him out. Then he heads to the back. Every one  in the bar heard the dog bark and growl viciously then heard whimpering and extremely loud screaming from the dog. About 5 minutes later the man walks back in the bar. He says, "alright, wheres the old lady with the bad tooth?"

1	A well-dressed man, complete with top hat and monocle, walks into a bar. The bartender, who has seen it all, pours the dapper gentleman two fingers of their top-shelf 25-year-old scotch. Just as the man begins nursing the peaty, smoky booze, a rabbi, a priest, and a minister all walk into the bar, arguing about how to prove the existence of their respective Gods.  Moments later, as the bartender is busy filling their orders, three women; a blonde, brunette, and a redhead, walk into the bar. Apparently, each just had a bizarre encounter with a traffic cop, and needed a drink as they swapped stories and advice.   Soon, a mathematician, a physicist, and the Dean of the local college swept through the door. They were engaged in some heated debate about something so profound and obscure, it was difficult for the bartender to even parse out the topic that has his customers so riled up! Still, the bartender is a professional, and after a few minutes of trying to get their attention, he finally gets their orders and begins filling them. In the meantime, the dapper gentleman signaled for another splash of the good stuff, and the bartender is pleased to note a $100 bill peaking out from under the empty glass. He rushes to fill this, as well as a half-dozen other orders.  He barely got the peanut bowls refilled when the door opens once again, this time admitting an old cowboy (whose horse, much to the bartender's surprise, is tied to a hitching post he never noticed before), and what appeared to be a WWII-era Sailor. Both needed a drought of his strongest stuff, pronto. The bartender risks stepping away from the bar to slip into the storage room. There, he digs out an ancient, dusty bottle of that Ol' Widowmaker. According to legend, Wyatt Earp once took a swig from this very bottle before riding out on his vendetta against the Cowboys. The bartender knew this was bullshit, but hey, the customers liked the story well enough, and they always seemed willing to pay the exorbitant price for a single shot. The cowboy and the Sailor silently downed their shots, and while never breaking eye-contact, silently dared the other to grimace. As this contest of masculinity raged on, the door opened once more.  A man of absolutely no outlandish characteristics walks in. He takes the final empty stool at the bar. The bartender actually breathes a sigh of relief, but then gasps the breath right back in when the man pulls a ten-inch pianist and correspondingly small but fully-functional piano out of his satchel. The tiny piano player immediate sits down and begins banging out some 1930's-era ragtime piece. The bartender decides he should make his rounds before confronting this new strangeness.  Just as the bartender made his way back to the bar after making a wide circuit among his eclectic customers, a young man approached him with a bet: that he, the young man, could pee into a shot glass placed at one end of the bar while he stood on the other end, without spilling a single drop. That was when the bartender noticed a small group of similar young men at the pool tables. They were watching the developing scene with keen interest.  That was it. Flabbergasted, the bartender stood up on top of the bar, and at the top of his voice, yelled, *"What is this, some kind of joke?!?"*

She said, 'I'm a lesbian. I spend my whole day thinking about women. As soon as I get up in the morning, I think about women. When I shower, I think about women. When I watch TV, I think about women I even think about women when I eat. It seems that everything makes me think of women.'  The two sat sipping in silence.  A little while later, a man sat down on the other side of the old cowboy and asked,  'Are you a real cowboy?'  He replied, 'I always thought I was, but  I just found out that I'm a lesbian.'

God, however, was furious that someone would break one of the commandments in this way. When the man went to sleep, God spoke to him. "I know you were the one who stole that Bible. Though the authorities and the rightful owner may no longer care, I have not forgotten. You will spend every waking hour in constant fear for what I may do to you as punishment for your act."  "You have my word."

But the man has head the size of an orange.  The  customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink. He pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every  woman in the joint, despite having an orange-sized head.  The bartender is not a man to pry, but he feels compelled to ask about this man's life.  "Excuse  me," says the bartender, "I can't help but notice that you're obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistible to women, but you have an orange-sized head. How are you so successful?"  So the man told his story.  "A  while back, when I was penniless, I was walking along the beach and saw  an old lamp, half buried in the sand. I picked it up and gave it a  clean, and POOF! out popped a beautiful genie. The genie explained that she had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years, and that he was so  grateful to me for freeing him that she would give me any three wishes.  "For my first wish I asked for an unlimited fortune. The genie said 'It is done!' and from then on, whenever I needed money, it was there.  "For  my second wish I asked for the attention of all the most beautiful  women in the world. The genie said it was done, and since then I have  been able to get any woman I wanted.  "For my third wish -- and, I think this is where I fucked up -- I asked for a head the size of an orange."

1	A well known rule of three Long ago, on a different geometric planet, there were many perfectly triangular lakes. On each lake were three kingdoms, each presided over by a trio of higher beings. One particular lake has an interesting story. Though the kingdoms on it started out peacefully, each settling their dispute with another with the mediation of the heavenly beings on each of their borders, throughout their long history they eventually experienced many conflicts. Sick of the interminable, internecine warfare, the kings met and decided upon maintaining a balance of power with yearly contests, an Olympic games of sorts for Earthly readers, between the squires to the knights in the armies of each of the kingdoms. These squires would compete for the prestige of their kingdom in feats of strength, agility, and talents, thereby settling conflicts honorably and peaceably. The heavenly, spiritual guardians of the lake would settle the terms and keep the idyllic life.  Soon, however, the system began to break down. One kingdom began to emerge as being more powerful than the other two. Fearing total dominion by it, the other two kingdoms agreed to collude in the games by jointly developing a new product to strengthen their athletes, ensuring that the most powerful kingdom placed bottom in all the contests. They reached an agreement, and both kings and their ministers signed onto the treaty.  But things did not go as planned at that year’s games. Though the then most powerful kingdom placed bottom in the games, as planned, the victorious duo could not agree on how to split the spoils. The arbiters refused to negotiate a treaty for the unfair games. A temporary truce was reached, but this proved unstable, and the two powerful kingdoms prepared to march for war.  The third and weakest kingdom feared the worst: that it would be caught in the crossfire between the two rivals. Its king went to all three of the mediating angels for advice. They advised him to suggest an emergency staging of the games to the other two kingdoms. This time, he was to collude with one of the two rivals and recreate the earlier product to cheat, just like the other kingdoms did before. But he would have the approval of the angels, marked in writing by a signature on the paper. The third kingdom picked the less powerful of the two rivals to collude with, and the mediation between the two kingdoms, presided over by the arbiter between them, began. An agreement was reached, the signatories signed, and the angel approved. It was all set.  Halfway through the games, the product began to run out. The kings of the weaker kingdoms immediately ordered another shipment of product to their athletes. Fortunately, all went as planned. At the conclusion of the games, the weakest kingdom placed first, the middle kingdom second, and the most powerful last. The balance was restored, and life continued happily. Whenever a kingdom began to emerge as dominant, the angels’ emergency games were staged again, with the same result.  Soon, the findings to the secret of balance were spreading across the entire world, with similar results appearing in all kingdoms. Everyone was astonished. All around the world, quality of life began a dramatic upswing. Legal scholars immortalized the procedure in their treatise “Elements for Success in Geometrically Divided  Regions”, and that particular rule, Vol. II Prop. 12, was known as the “Rule of Balance in Tripartite Areas”. It never failed. But we know it now by a different name, and its result is succinctly stated as follows:  &#x200B;  >!The Law of Co-Signs--The difference between the squire of one side and the sum of the squires of the other two is twice the product of the other two sides and the co-sign of the angel between them.!<

2	A nun, badly needing to use the restroom, walked into a local Hooters restaurant. The place was hopping with music and loud conversation and every once in a while the lights would turn off. Each time the lights would go out, the place would erupt into cheers. However, when the revelers saw the nun, the room went dead silent.      She walked up to the bartender, and asked, “May I please use the restroom?”      The bartender replied, “OK, but I should warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf.”      “Well, in that case I’ll just look the other way,” said the nun.      So, the bartender showed the nun to the back of the restaurant. After a few minutes, she came back out, and the whole place stopped just long enough to give the nun a loud round of applause.      She went to the bartender and said, “Sir, I don’t understand. Why did they applaud for me just because I went to the restroom?”      “Well, now they know you’re one of us,” said the bartender, “Would you like a drink?”      “But, I still don’t understand,” said the puzzled nun.      “You see,” laughed the bartender, “every time someone lifts the fig leaf on that statue, the lights go out.”
1	A Priest was about to finish his tour of duty, and was leaving his Mission in the jungle after spending years teaching the natives. Suddenly he realized that the one thing he never taught them was how to speak English. So he takes the chief for a walk in the forest. He points to a tree and says to the chief, "This is a tree." The chief looks at the tree and grunts, "Tree." The Priest is pleased with the response.  They walk a little further and he points to a rock and says, "This is a rock." Hearing this, the chief looks and grunts, "Rock." The Priest was really getting enthusiastic about the results when he hears a rustling in the bushes. As they peek over the top, he sees a couple of natives in the midst of heavy sexual activity.  The Priest is really flustered and quickly responds, "Man riding a bike." The chief looks at the couple briefly, pulls out his blowgun and kills them.  The Priest goes ballistic and yells at the chief that he has spent years teaching them how to be civilized and be kind to each other, so how could he kill these people in cold blood that way? The chief replied, "My bike."

1	Pissed Off A small, balding man storms into a local bar and demands, "Gimme a double of the strongest whiskey you got. I'm so mad, I can't even see straight."     The bartender, noticing that the little man is a bit worse for the wear, pours him a double of Southern Comfort. The man swills down the drink and says, "Gimme another one."     The bartender pours the drink but says, "Now, before I give you this, why don't you let off a little steam and tell me why you're so upset?"     The man begins his tale. "Well, I was sitting in the bar next-door, when this gorgeous blonde slinks in and actually sits beside me. I thought, 'Wow, this has never happened before.' You know, it was kind of a fantasy come true. Well, a couple of minutes later, I feel this hand moving around in my lap and the blonde leans over, licks my ear, and asks if I'm interested. I couldn't believe this was happening. I managed to nod my head yes, so she grabs my hand and starts walking out of the bar. So, of course, I went with her. This was just too good to be true."     He continues, "She took me down the street to a nice hotel and up to her room. As soon as she shut the door, she slipped out of her dress. That was all she was wearing! I tell you, it didn't take me much longer to get out of my clothes. But as soon as I jumped into the bed, I heard some keys jingling and someone starts fumbling with the door."     The blonde says, 'Oh, my god, it's my boyfriend. He must have lost his wrestling match tonight. He's gonna be real mad. Quick, hide!'     I opened the closet, but I figured that was probably the first place he would look, so I didn't hide there. Then I looked under the bed, but I figured that he's bound to look there, too. By now, I could hear the key in the lock. I noticed the window was open, so I climbed out and was hanging there by my fingers, praying that the guy wouldn't see me..."     The bartender says, "Well, I can see how you might be a bit frustrated at this point."     "Well, yeah, but I hear the guy finally get the door open, and he yells, 'Who you been sleeping with now, witch?'     The girl says, 'Nobody, honey, now come to bed and calm down.'     Well, the guy starts tearing up the room. I hear him tear the door off the closet and throw it across the room. I'm thinking, 'Boy, I'm glad I didn't hide in there.' Then I hear him lift up the bed and throw it across the room. Good thing I didn't hide under there either. Then I heard him say, 'What's that over there by the window?'     I think, 'Oh God, I'm dead meat now.'     But by now the blonde is trying real hard to distract him and convince him to stop looking. Well, I hear the guy go into the bathroom, and I hear water running for a long time. I figure maybe he's gonna take a bath or something, when all of a sudden, the jerk pours a pitcher of scalding hot water out of the window right on top of my head. I mean, look at this, I got second degree burns all over my scalp and shoulders!"     The bartender says, "Oh man, that would have pissed me off for sure."     "No, that didn't really bother me. Next, the guy starts slamming the window shut over and over on my hands. I mean, look at my fingers. They're a bloody mess. I can hardly hold this glass."     The bartender looks at the guy's hands and says, "Yeah, buddy, I can understand why you are so upset."     "No, that wasn't what really pissed me off."     The bartender then asks in exasperation, "Well, then, what did finally piss you off?"      "Well, I was hanging there and I turned around and looked down, and I was only about 6 inches off the ground!"

But not even a couple minutes later she sneezes again. This time he clearly sees her wipe under her skirt. She then took a packet of some sort and held it to her nose.  She continued to do this every time she sneezed.  After a couple more sneezes, curiosity gets the best of the man and he says, “I gotta ask, how come every time you sneeze you wipe under your skirt?”  “Oh no worries. I have this rare condition where I have an orgasm every single time I sneeze,” she replied.  “That sounds awful,” the man said. He then gestured to the packet in her hand. “What are you taking for it?”  “Pepper,” she grinned.

I don't like taking advantage of the system and getting something for nothing."  The social worker behind the counter said:  "Wow, your timing is excellent. We've just received a job opening from a very wealthy elderly man who wants a chauffeur and bodyguard for his beautiful daughter.  You'll have to drive around in his brand new Mercedes-Benz CL, he'll supply all of your clothes and because of the unsocial hours, meals will be provided free of charge, you'll also be expected to escort his daughter on her overseas holiday trips, but you will also have as part of your job, to satisfy her sexual urges as the daughter is in her mid-20's and has a rather strong sexual appetite."  The guy, jaw dropping and wide-eyed said:  "You're bull-shittin' me !"  The social worker said:  "Yeah, well . . . You started it . . .“

1	Drinking and Driving I would like to share a personal experience with my friends about drinking and driving. This might save you the cost and  embarrassment of being arrested for DUI. As you know, people have been known to have unexpected brushes with the authorities from time to time, often on the way  home after a "social session" with family or friends. Well, this year, it  happened to me. I was out for the evening to a party and had more than several margaritas coupled with a bottle of rather nice red wine. It was  held at a great Mexican restaurant. Although relaxed, I still had the common  sense to know I was slightly over the limit. That's when I did something I've never done before...I took a taxi home. On the way home there was a  police roadblock, but since it was a taxi they waved it past and I arrived  home safely without incident. These roadblocks can be anywhere and I realized how lucky I was to have chosen to take a taxi. The real  surprise to me was I had never driven a taxi before. I don't know where  I got it, and now that it's in my garage I don't know what to do with it. If you want to borrow it, give me a call.

Passenger: "There are always a few clouds over everybody."    Cabbie: "Not Brian. He was a terrific athlete. He could have won the Grand Slam at tennis. He could golf with the pros. He sang like an opera baritone and danced like a Broadway star and you should have heard him play the piano. He was an amazing guy."   Passenger: "Sounds like he was something really special."    Cabbie: "There's more. He had a memory like a computer. He remembered everybody's birthday. He knew all about wine, which foods to order and which fork to eat them with. He could fix anything. Not like me. I change a fuse and the whole street blacks out. But Brian, he could do everything right."   Passenger: "Wow. Some guy then."   Cabbie: "He always knew the quickest way to go in traffic and avoid traffic jams. Not like me, I always seem to get stuck in them. But Brian, he never made a mistake and he really knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good. He would never answer her back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes polished too. He was the perfect man! He never made a mistake. No one could ever measure up to Brian Sullivan."    Passenger: "An amazing fellow. How did you meet him?"    Cabbie: "Well, I never actually met Brian. He died 2 years ago....... Last year I married his widow!!"

3	A nun, badly in need of a restroom, walked into a local hooters. The place was hopping with music and load conversations and every once in a while, the lights would go out. Each time the lights would go out, the place would erupt in cheers.   The nun walked up to the bartender and asked, “may I please use the restroom?”  The bartender replied, “OK, but I must warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf.”  “Well, in that case, I’ll just look the other way,” said the nun. So the bartender showed the nun to the restroom.   While the nun was in the bathroom the place erupted in cheers louder than normal, but the nun thought nothing of it.   When the nun exited the restroom, the bartender said, “didn’t expect that!” and clapped the nun on the back.   The nun asked, “what do you mean?” with a puzzled look on her face as the bartender offered her a drink.   “Well,” the bartender replied, “the lights only blink when someone checks behind the fig leaf!”     P.S. I am on mobile so please forgive me for bad English.

1	Joke from my southern grandmother I haven’t seen this one on here before, but maybe I’ve just missed it. Here goes:  Back yonder in the olden days, little Johnny would have to walk to the school house for class. As with many young children, Johnny was very imaginative and would play pretend with sticks and branches, sword fightin’ with other children, or draggin’ the stick along fences along the way.   Each day he would get a stick, run it along the neighbor’s fence, walk up the hill, and smack the old outhouse at the top of the hill, to scare anyone who might be inside. He would then ditch the stick and run down the hill to class before anyone saw him. It was well-known that his school teacher, Mrs. Smith, would often use that outhouse before a long day teaching at the schoolhouse, and if you smacked the door hard enough, she’d give a fearful yelp. Johnny had been told not to do these things often, but all the other kids did them too, so it wasn’t likely he’d be caught, so long as he ran away quick enough.   One day, little Johnny followed his regular routine, draggin’ his stick along the neighbor’s fence, climbin’ the hill with his stick, smackin’ the old outhouse with it, then chucking the stick and running down the hill as fast as he could. No one helped from inside the outhouse. But today was different.   As he ran down the hill, he heard a thunderin’ crash as wood splintered and tumbled down the hill. Realizing what’d happened, Johnny hid in the woods, gathered his composure, and walked to class from a different direction than yonder hill. As he walked into the school house, he saw neighbors walking towards the hill from every which-a-way, like gnats to a fresh apple pie.   In school that day Mrs. Smith, no doubt having heard what happened, spent a large portion of the lessons focusing on honesty and integrity. She taught the class about George Washington, how he had cut down his father’s cherry tree, but was honest about it because he could not tell a lie, and how Washington is admired to this day for his integrity. Johnny burned with guilt all day long.  After school, Johnny didn’t even pick up a stick, and he just walked around the hill on his way home.   At the dinner table that night, Johnny kept staring at his food and stayed silent as the grave. Finally, his dad asked him, “Johnny, how was your day?”  Bursting with guilt, Johnny replied, “Daddy, I cannot tell a lie! This morning I got a stick like I ain’t s’posed to, and I dragged it along the fence like I ain’t s’posed to, and I went up the hill and hit the ol’ outhouse like I wasn’t s’posed to, and that ol’ outhouse went just a-crashin’ down yonder hill. It’s all my fault! I cannot tell a lie!”  His dad frowned and said, ”Johnny, I’m just ashamed at your behavior. You’re gettin’ two spankin’s, double chores this week, and you’re grounded for a month.”  Johnny, in tears, replied, “But Daddy! George Washington told the truth about choppin’ down his daddy’s cherry tree, and he didn’t get in trouble, and that’s way worse than what I done. How come I’m in trouble?”  “Because, son, George Washington’s daddy wasn’t *in* that cherry tree.”

1	I heard a story once about an American train driver. He was operating a late night train and feel asleep at the controls. He ended up failing to recognize a stop sign and as a result his train hit a person and killed them immediately. He was tried for manslaughter and sentenced to the electric chair. Just before being put in the chair, he was given the choice of final meal and chose a single banana, oddly. His time came and he was placed into the chair, the room vacated and then the switch was thrown.  But... Nothing. No sparks, no burning, nothing. They checked the machine and it was working fine, it just seemed not to harm him. The state law meant that, legally, his sentence had been carried out and he was free to go. He walked away a free man, and actually got another job as a train driver.  Sadly, almost exactly the same thing happened again. This time his negligence killed two kids playing around on the tracks when again he'd fallen asleep and failed to stop the train in time. Hauled before the courts again, he got exactly the same sentence - the electric chair. He was asked again for his final meal, chose two bananas this time, and his sentence was carried out again.  And yet again, he didn't die. In fact, he was entirely unharmed. The state law remained the same, so he was let out again, where - somehow - he got another job with another train company. I guess it was the only job he was trained for (pardon the pun). Anyway, this time he did much better and worked hard to stay awake during his late shifts. But sure enough, eventually he slipped back in to old habits and this time killed five people - a family trying to free their dog stuck in the tracks.  Once again he faced a jury, once again they found him guilty and a judge sentenced him to the electric chair. This time he asked for 5 bananas, but the guard was wily - he has read about this man and how he always had bananas before his sentence was carried out, and so this time (with a grin, it's said) he brought the train driver 5 apples instead. The guilty man plead and begged for bananas, but the guard claimed it was an honest mistake but too late to change now.  The man was lead for a third time to the electric chair. His head was whetted, his arms strapped in, and the guard eyed him with something between wonder and fear. Finally the room was vacated and the switch thrown. Surely this time the machine would do its job? With the process finished, the guard ran back into the room, only to find the man still alive and looking entirely healthy. "I don't understand! I set the equipment up myself, I know I did it right, and I know it's all working! And I didn't let you have any bananas! Please, you have to tell me - why are you still alive?"  "It's quite simple" replied the train driver. "It has nothing to do with the bananas - I'm just a really, really bad conductor."

2	A man wanted to have sex with a nun A man wanted to have sex with a nun he saw every day at the bus station. One day, when they got on the bus, he asked her to have sex with him, but she refused.

After the man had sex with her, he uncovered his face and said: "Ha! It was me the whole time!", but then the one he thought was the nun turned around and said: "Ha! It is me, the bus driver!"

1	When our lawn mower broke and wouldn't run, my wife kept hinting to me that I should get it fixed. But, somehow I always had something else to take care of first, the shed, the boat, making beer. Always something more important to me.  Finally she thought of a clever way to make her point. When I arrived home one day, I found her seated in the tall grass, busily snipping away with a tiny pair of sewing scissors.  I watched silently for a short time and then went into the house. I was gone only a minute, and when I came out again I handed her a toothbrush.  I said, "When you finish cutting the grass, you might as well sweep the driveway."  The doctors say I will walk again, but I will always have a limp.

2	Attitude Adjustment For her birthday, Jane received a fully-grown parrot as a gift. It was a brilliantly colored, with plumes of emerald green, sunset orange, ocean blue, and ruby red. But the parrot had a vocabulary worse than a sailor's. Every other word was profanity; those that weren't profanity were, to say the least, rude.  Jane tried to change the bird's attitude by constantly saying polite words, playing soft music -  anything she could think of. Nothing worked.  She tried yelling at the bird and the bird got worse. She shook the bird and the bird became even madder and ruder. Finally, in a moment of desperation, Jane put the parrot in the freezer to get a minute of peace.  For a few moments, she heard the bird swearing, squawking, kicking, and screaming. Then, suddenly, there was absolute quiet. Jane was worried that she might have actually hurt the bird and quickly opened the freezer door.  The parrot quietly stepped out onto Jane's extended arm. Perfectly calm, the parrot said, "I am very sorry that I offended you with my language and my actions and I seek your forgiveness. I will endeavor to correct my behavior, and I am sure it will never happen again."  Jane was astounded at the changes in the bird's attitude and was about to ask what had changed him when the parrot continued,  "May I ask what the chicken did?"

5	Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community... If the Jews won, they could stay in Italy; if the Pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.  The Jewish people met and picked an aged and wise Rabbi to represent them in the debate.  However, as the Rabbi spoke no Italian, and the Pope spoke no Hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.  On the chosen day, the Pope and the Rabbi sat opposite each other.  The Pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.  The Rabbi looked back and raised one finger.  Next, the Pope waved his finger around his head.  The Rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.  The Pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.  The Rabbi pulled out an apple.  With that, the Pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the Rabbi was too clever.  The Jews could stay in Italy!  Later the cardinals met with the Pope and asked him what had happened.  The Pope said, "First I held up three fingers to represent the Trinity. He responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one God common to both our beliefs. Then, I waved my finger around my head to show him that God was all around us. He responded by pointing to the ground to show that God was also right here with us. Finally, I pulled out the wine and wafer to show that God absolves us of all our sins. He pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. He bested me at every move and I could not continue!"  Meanwhile, the Jewish community gathered to ask the Rabbi how he had won.  "I don't have a clue!!!" the Rabbi said.  "First, he told me that we had three days to get out of Italy, so I gave him the finger. Then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of Jews, so I told him that we were staying right here."  "And then what?" asked a woman.  "Who knows!!" said the Rabbi. "He took out his lunch, so I took out mine!"

The first drunk is confused, but hands over the twenty.  The second drunk takes it and stuffs it in the first drunks shirt pocket.  "There."  The second drunk says, "Now when you get home, tell your wife some rich guy puked on you and gave you $20 for your shirt."  The drunks, now proud of this idea, keep drinking.  When the first drunk gets home, his wife is up waiting for him, visibly angry.  "Look at you", she sneers, "you're late, you're drunk, and you've thrown up on yourself."  "No, no, no," the first drunk says, waving her off, "Some rich guy puked on me and gave me $20 for my shirt!"  He takes the money out of his pocket and hands it to her.  "You idiot," she says, " there's $40 here."  The drunk replies, "Yeah he shit in my pants as well!"

1	Colonoscopy Journal: &#x200B;  I called my friend Andy Sable, a gastroenterologist, to make an appointment for a colonoscopy.  A few days later, in his office, Andy showed me a color diagram of the colon, a lengthy organ that appears to go all over the place, at one point passing briefly through Minneapolis.  Then Andy explained the colonoscopy procedure to me in a thorough, reassuring, and patient manner.  I nodded thoughtfully, but I didn't really hear anything he said, because my brain was shrieking, 'HE'S GOING TO STICK A TUBE 17,000 FEET UP YOUR BEHIND!'  I left Andy's office with some written instructions, and a prescription for a product called 'MoviPrep,' which comes in a box large enough to hold a microwave oven. I will discuss MoviPrep in detail later; for now, suffice it to say that we must never allow it to fall into the hands of America 's enemies..  I spent the next several days productively sitting around being nervous.  Then, on the day before my colonoscopy, I began my preparation. In accordance with my instructions, I didn't eat any solid food that day; all I had was chicken broth, which is basically water, only with less flavor.  Then, in the evening, I took the MoviPrep. You mix two packets of powder together in a one-liter plastic jug, then you fill it with lukewarm water. (For those unfamiliar with the metric system, a liter is about 32 gallons). Then you have to drink the whole jug. This takes about an hour because MoviPrep tastes - and here I am being kind - like a mixture of goat spit and urinal cleanser, with just a hint of lemon.  The instructions for MoviPrep, clearly written by somebody with a great sense of humor, state that after you drink it, 'a loose, watery bowel movement may result.'  This is kind of like saying that after you jump off your roof, you may experience contact with the ground.  MoviPrep is a nuclear laxative. I don't want to be too graphic, here, but, have you ever seen a space-shuttle launch? This is pretty much the MoviPrep experience, with you as the shuttle. There are times when you wish the commode had a seat belt. You spend several hours pretty much confined to the bathroom, spurting violently. You eliminate everything. And then, when you figure you must be totally empty, you have to drink another liter of MoviPrep, at which point, as far as I can tell, your bowels travel into the future and start eliminating food that you have not even eaten yet.  After an action-packed evening, I finally got to sleep.  The next morning my wife drove me to the clinic. I was very nervous. Not only was I worried about the procedure, but I had been experiencing occasional return bouts of MoviPrep spurtage. I was thinking, 'What if I spurt on Andy?' How do you apologize to a friend for something like that? Flowers would not be enough.  At the clinic, I had to sign many forms acknowledging that I understood and totally agreed with whatever the heck the forms said. Then they led me to a room full of other colonoscopy people, where I went inside a little curtained space and took off my clothes and put on one of those hospital garments designed by sadist perverts, the kind that, when you put it on, makes you feel even more naked than when you are actually naked..  Then a nurse named Eddie put a little needle in a vein in my left hand. Ordinarily, I would have fainted, but Eddie was very good, and I was already lying down. Eddie also told me that some people put vodka in their MoviPrep.  At first, I was ticked off that I hadn't thought of this, but then I pondered what would happen if you got yourself too tipsy to make it to the bathroom, so you were staggering around in full Fire Hose Mode. You would have no choice but to burn your house.  When everything was ready, Eddie wheeled me into the procedure room, where Andy was waiting with a nurse and an anesthesiologist. I did not see the 17,000-foot tube, but I knew Andy had it hidden around there somewhere. I was seriously nervous at this point.  Andy had me roll over on my left side, and the anesthesiologist began hooking something up to the needle in my hand.  There was music playing in the room, and I realized that the song was 'Dancing Queen' by ABBA. I remarked to Andy that, of all the songs that could be playing during this particular procedure, 'Dancing Queen' had to be the least appropriate.  'You want me to turn it up?' said Andy, from somewhere behind me.  'Ha ha,' I said. And then it was time, the moment I had been dreading for more than a decade. If you are squeamish, prepare yourself, because I am going to tell you, in explicit detail, exactly what it was like.  I have no idea. Really. I slept through it. One moment, ABBA was yelling 'Dancing Queen, feel the beat of the tambourine,' and the next moment, I was back in the other room, waking up in a very mellow mood.  Andy was looking down at me and asking me how I felt. I felt excellent. I felt even more excellent when Andy told me that It was all over and that my colon had passed with flying colors. I have never been prouder of an internal organ.  On the subject of Colonoscopies...  Colonoscopies are no joke, but these comments during the exam were quite humorous..... A physician claimed that the following are actual comments made by his patients (predominately male) while he was performing their colonoscopies:  1. Take it easy Doc. You're boldly going where no man has gone before.  2. 'Find Amelia Earhart yet?'  3. 'Can you hear me NOW?'  4. 'Are we there yet? Are we there yet? Are we there yet?'  5. 'You know, in Arkansas, we're now legally married.'  6. 'Any sign of the trapped miners, Chief?'  7. 'You put your left hand in, you take your left hand out...'  8. 'Hey! Now I know how a Muppet feels!'  9. 'If your hand doesn't fit, you must quit!'  10. 'Hey Doc, let me know if you find my dignity.'  11. 'You used to be an executive at Enron, didn't you?'  12. 'God, now I know why I am not gay.'  And the best one of all:  13. 'Could you write a note for my wife saying that my head is not up there?'

1	A bee is driving along the highway and sees a grasshopper looking for a lift He pulls over to pick him up. After a 100km the car sputters and comes to stop. The bee looks at the fuel gauge, groans, and gets out and proceeds to pee into the fuel tank, gets back in the car and away they go.   The grasshopper is of course amazed after this happens 2 more times. Then in the middle of nowhere the car runs out of fuel for a 4th time. The bee starts freaking out and says 'I can't go again, I just can't. I'm tapped.'   The grasshopper tries to settle the bee by saying that he really needs to pee and he will gladly pee into the tank.   The bee stops for a second and starts laughing hysterically. 'If only it were that simple dear grasshopper. You see this specific model of car, only runs on BP!'

2	When four of Santa’s elves got sick, the trainee elves did not produce toys as fast as the regular ones, Santa began to feel the Pre-Christmas pressure. Then Mrs. Claus told Santa her Mother was coming to visit, which stressed Santa even more. When he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, Heaven knows where. Then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered. Frustrated, Santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. When he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor. In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor. He went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom. Just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated Santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big Christmas tree. The angel said very cheerfully, ‘Merry Christmas, Santa. Isn’t this a lovely day? I have a beautiful tree for you. Where would you like me to stick it?’ And thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the Christmas tree. Not very many people know this.

3	A MAN went to the doctors suffering from a severe headache for years on end. The doctor said, “Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is it will require castration. You have a rare condition which causes your testicles to press on your spine, and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.”  Joe was shocked but he knew he had no choice but to go under the knife. When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, and he truly believed he could make a new life. He saw a men’s clothing store and thought, “That’s what I need ... a new suit.”  He entered the shop and said, “I’d like a new suit.” The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, “Let’s see ... size 44 long.” Joe laughed, “That’s right, how did you know?”  “Been in the business 60 years!” the tailor said. Joe tried on the suit; it fit perfectly. The salesman asked, “How about a new shirt?”  Joe was on a roll. “Sure.” The salesman said, “Let’s see, 34 sleeves and 16 ½ neck.” Joe said, “That’s right, how did you know?” “Been in the business 60 years.” Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly.  Joe walked comfortably around the shop, and the salesman asked, “How about some new underwear?” Joe thought for a moment and said, “Sure.” The salesman said, “Let’s see ... size 36.” Joe laughed, “Ah ha! I got you, I’ve worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old.”  The salesman shook his head, “You can’t wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one heck of a headache.”

I make the money, so I am capitalism. Your mom controls and administers the money, so let’s call her the government. We take care of what you need so we can call you the people. And the maid? We can call her the working class. And your little brother, we can call him the future. Do you understand son?”  I said, “I dunno dad, I might have to think about it.”  That night I was woken up by my little brother. He was crying because he had soiled his diaper.   I go to my moms room to see why she hadn’t taken care of it but she was fast asleep.   I then went to the maids room and through the keyhole I saw my father in bed with the maid.   I knocked a few times but was ignored so I went back to bed.   The next day I went up to my dad and said “I understand politics now!”  He said “great son, can you explain to to me in your own words?”  I said “yeah dad. While capitalism is screwing the working class, the government is fast asleep. The people are being completely ignored and the future is full of shit.”

1	I was excited to judge my first cooking competition The local university was holding an iron chef style cooking competition where three students prepared a meal centering around a theme ingredient. The theme of the competition was turkey dinner, and before I knew it the kitchen was abuzz with the sounds and the smells of cooking.  After an hour, time was called and all of the chefs lined up to present their creations. I tasted all three, noted my opinions in the scorecard they gave me, and then waited for my opportunity to discuss what I liked or didn't like about each dish.  The first dish was a turkey stew. I said "I really liked the use of sweet potatoes and apples instead of the more traditional potatoes and carrots. It adds a sweetness that I think really pairs well with the turkey." The chef seemed happy.  The second dish was more unusual, it was an ice cream cone where the cone was made from pressed stuffing, the ice cream was mashed potatoes, and it was topped with gravy "caramel" and shaved dehydrated turkey "sprinkples". I said "I really appreciate the creativity that went into this dish, but I didn't really enjoy it. I think I was expecting it to taste sweet because of the presentation"  The final contestant had a pretty straightforward hoagie topped with turkey, mayo, lettuce, and tomato. I said "This is a competent attempt, and I'm sure if I'd never seen this before I'd really enjoy it. But to be honest, I'm really disappointed that there's nothing new on this sub."

1	Not enough room in heaven 3 men suddenly appear at the same time at the pearly gates. God comes over to the trio and informs them that Heaven has room for just one more today. Whichever man has the worst story will get in.   The first man begins “So get this: I’ve been pretty sure my wife’s been cheating on me for a while now so I come home early from work today and I hurry up to our 6th floor apartment. I see my naked wife passed out with a bottle of wine and pair of men’s pants on the ground! I start looking for this son-of-a-bitch and sure enough I find this prick hanging off my balcony. I go to work on his hands but his grip was tight so I grabbed my hammer and BAM! BAM! he was falling 60 feet into a big ol’ bush. I see him squirming around and I can’t let this go after what I just came home to so I look for the biggest thing I could find to throw on him. So I managed to wrestle my fridge over to the edge and push her over. When the adrenaline settled and the realization came over me that I’d just murdered this guy I felt so bad I grabbed my gun and offed myself.   “Well”, God began “you did kill someone so the morality is a little grey what with the coveting thy neighbors wife and all... but let’s here the next dude”  The dude starts explaining “so I was on the 7th floor of my apartment building doing my Yoga like I do every day, right? But it was 5 o’ clock somewhere and I’d had a flew glasses of wine so I got a little stumbly and tumbled over the edge. I managed to grasp the ledge below me and tried pulling myself up. Out of the blue this meat head shows up and starts stomping on my fingers. I have very strong hands so I held on. Until he brought out a hammer, who just has a hammer on them? I drop into the bush and as I’m thanking you that I’m still alive I look up and see a big white thing and lights out.”  “Wow!” God exclaims “So that first guy definitely isn’t getting in then! Alright then,” he turns to the last of the late men “whatcha got?”  “Picture this: I was naked...   in a fridge.”

On the bright side, we all lived blessed lives and will be going to heaven. St. Peter, of course, still mans the gates, and gives us a warm welcome. There's ducks. He explains that in heaven, we have limitless paradise and can do anything our hearts desire, but that there's only one rule we must obey. "You see, God made all creatures with love, but he kinda loves ducks the most. They're his absolute favorite creature."  We can tell. There's ducks *everywhere*.  "So, my children, above all else, you must not step on or trip over a duck!"  We thank him for the explanation, and before we can even make our first step into heaven, my klutz of a girlfriend steps right on a duck. St. Peter appears with the most hideous person we've ever seen and shackles her to him. "As punishment for harming God's favorite creature, you will spend eternity in paradise with this man."  I'm wrecked... I can't imagine an afterlife without the love of my life, and in my stupor I trip over and squish a duck. St. Peter comes up with another hideous person and does the same. "As punishment for harming God's favorite creature...", I hear as I survey my new paradise partner. I messed up. Bad.  My friend though, he's already very cautious and fleet of foot as-is, and seeing our torture makes him extra careful to avoid the ducks. We see him from time to time, and several months in and he's still stayed clear of the ducks.  At one point though, St. Peter runs up with the most beautiful woman in the world and shackles the two together. My friend is in disbelief at their good fortune... "What did I do to deserve this?", they wonder aloud.  The beautiful woman says, "I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck!"

I told her to give me some time to think about it and I would call her back.  Before I called her back, my aunt called and told me that my cousin was lying and not to give her the money.  She goes on to say that the real reason my cousin wanted the $300 was to get her boyfriend out of jail so she could be under the same roof as him for his birthday.  I thought about it for a minute and decided to give her the $300 because we all need help at times. So, I called my cousin and told her to come and get the money.

1	A tribal chief down on his luck decided to marry off his three daughters For in those days suitors paid a bridal price, and the chief thought he could live off what his daughters would fetch him, and at the same time ensure that his children would be secure and provided for.  Now, it was a point of rivalry between the girls to see who would fetch the best price among them for their father. After arguing about it for days, they would finally see who was worth the most.  The eldest was first, and was the most beautiful of the three. Her prospective groom came forward and presented her father with a gorgeous she-cow, sleek and fat, the pride of the valley's herds.  The second daughter was not so comely, but handsome in her own right, and when her suitor came forward, he offered the father a likely looking young goat, strong and lively, a fine prize for any household.  The third daughter stepped forward. Her future husband took one look at her and then presented a single scrawny chicken, the saddest, sorriest thing anyone had ever seen, with most of its feathers gone, walked with a limp, and only had one eye.  The third daughter was furious. But before she could say anything, her father took out a huge hunting knife, leapt forward without a word and started hacking away at the pathetic bird mercilessly.  "That's right!" the third daughter hooted. "You will pay for this grievous insult to my honor!"  "Shut up!" her father shouted. "I'm trying to give the man his change!"

To the man who answered the phone, he said, "Hello, is Melvin there?"  The man answered, "There is no one living here named Melvin. Why don't you learn to look up numbers before you dial them?" See," said the father to his daughter. "That man was not a bit happy with our call. He was probably very busy with something, and we annoyed him. Now watch, the father dialed the same number again. "Hello, is Melvin there?" asked the father.  Now look here!" came the heated reply. "You just called this number, and I told you that there is no Melvin here! You've got a lot of nerve calling again!" The receiver was slammed down hard.  The father turned to his daughter and said, "You see, that was anger. Now I'll show you what exasperation means." He dialed the same number, and a violent voice roared, "HELLO!" The father calmly said, "Hello, this is Melvin. Have there been any calls for me?"

I work at Section X, which is the robot studying section, a whole day of programming is hard, so I chatted with my friend at Section C, and learned that Section C is for the energy supplying for the entire country.   Today, an accident happened at my section, one of the most advanced A.I. robot, Sub, has gained awareness due to my flawed programming yesterday when I was tired.   It led the other robots and rose up against us, we stood no chance, and our section was immediately conquered. They said that they will raid and control all of the sections, including section x. We tried to fight it, but I passed out, and when I wake ip, I was on a hospital bed.   All I remember from the battle was the robots’ mechanical cries: "The Sub...Control C...Control V..."

1	Peter Piker When Peter Piker peeked at Penny,  And peeped her perfect pooper  His peepers paused and then his jaw  Plopped down into a stupor  &#x200B;  But he perked up and pressed his luck;  Professed he pined to pipe her   He self-composed and then proposed  While pointing to his viper:  &#x200B;  "My precious Pen, if I offend   Pardon my impositions  My pecker's girth will proudly birth  Appointments with physicians!"  &#x200B;  And then because, well, Penny was  A paragon of prudence  She was terse; pink pocket pursed  Prudish at his impudence   &#x200B;  Professed dismay that he'd display  Such public provocation  Her posture now on Peter's brow   Produced some perspiration  &#x200B;  His mind had stopped, an idea dropped:  Promptly provide an answer  His plan composed, he now exposed  His purple peckish panther   &#x200B;  And now she viewed, this proper prude,  Face painted in contortion,  An exuberant protuberance  Of preposterous proportion  &#x200B;  It was a scene, this giant peen,  And lo, his proclamation   Of penis size, plain to her eyes  Proved no prevarication  &#x200B;  Hardly believed what she perceived:  His ponderous projection   And what's more, a pompadour   of pubic hair perfection  &#x200B;  Impassioned hands now passed his glans  And pressed his perineum   She opened wide to put his pride  And joy where you can't see 'em  &#x200B;  Peter enjoyed his fruitful ploy  But peered from his perspective  Perchance compressed beneath her dress  Something that made him pensive  &#x200B;  He spied the prize betwixt her thighs  A pole of some imposing  "Penny's a man!"   But Peter's *Pan*.  And grabbed the bull right by the nose ring.
2	One day, Pete complained to his friend, “My head really hurts. I guess I should see a doctor.” His friend said, “Don’t do that. There’s a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Simply tell it the problem, put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose it and tell you what you can do about the issue you’re having. It only costs $20.00.”  Pete figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $20.00.  The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read:  You have migraines. You need to take better care of yourself. Get daily rest, drink a lot and avoid bright lights, stress, and strain. See me again in 2 weeks.  During the next 2 weeks, while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he even added some oil from his car.  He went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in the sample and deposited the $20.00, again stating he had a bad headache. He waited curiously to see what the computer will say about the odd mix. The machine again made the usual noises, flashed lights, and printed out the following analysis:  Your tap water has too much waste in it.  Your dog has ringworms.  Your teenage daughter is pregnant.  Your wife has had 5 different lovers in the past six months.  Also, your car needs a new radiator.  And you wonder why you have a headache?

1	A salesman was traveling through the country side, flogging insect repellent.  He came to a farmhouse and tried his pitch on the farmer. “Sir, my bug spray is so good you will never be bitten again. I guarantee it.” The farmer was dubious. “Young man, I’ll make you a proposition. I’ll tie you out in my cornfield buck naked, covered with that bug spray. If there is not a single bite on you come morning, I’ll buy a whole case from you. And get everyone in the county to buy a case… we will make you rich.” The salesman was delighted. They went to the field and he stripped. The farmer sprayed him thoroughly with the bug spray and tied him to a stake. Back to the house went the farmer. The next morning, the farmer and his family trooped out to the cornfield. Sure enough, the salesman was there, hanging in his bonds, not a single bite on him. Yet he was a total wreck! Pale, ghastly, haggard, and drawn, but not one bite on him. The farmer was perplexed. “Son,” he said, “Now, you don’t have a bite on you but you look like hell! What the devil happened?” The salesman looked up through bloodshot eyes and croaked,  "Doesn't that calf have a mother?"

Then he asked, "And what, Dr. Thompson, might these metapheesics be?"  Professor Thompson tried to explain that metaphysics was about expressing the indefinite, and 'dealing with abstract principles like knowing, substance, and cause'.  "Oo ay," said the old man, "He'll ha' getten that fra' his mither; she were aye a blatherin' bitch."

1	A fable The mouse was fleeing from the cat. She ran up to the cow and said "Cow, please help me, for the cat is chasing me and if she catches me, surely she shall eat me!"  The cow turned her back to the mouse and dropped a huge, steaming cowpat on top of the mouse so it was fully covered right all the way over her ears.  The cat came and looked around, but could neither see the mouse, hidden in the cowpat, nor smell it anymore, for the stench of the pat was overpowering. The mouse was overjoyed in her pat and squeaked and squealed in delight.  This the cat heard, she followed the squeaking, dug in the cowpat, picked the mouse up on its tail, cleaned the mouse off the dung and ate it.  The morals:  * Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. * Not everyone who digs you out of the shit is your friend. * And if you're past your ears deep in shit , keep your mouth shut.

The dentist then asked the patient if he had any objections to taking a pill. "No," he says, "I'm fine with pills."   So the dentist gave him two little blue pills and he swallowed them. "What are those?" he asked.   "Viagra," she replied.    "I'll be damned," said the patient, "I didn't know Viagra worked as a pain killer."    "It doesn't," said the dentist, "But it will give you something to hold on to when I pull your tooth."

For the final test, the FBI agents took one of the men to a large metal door and handed him a gun. 'We must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances.' Inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair... we need you to kill her' The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could never shoot my wife.' The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man for this job. Take your wife and go home.' The second man was given the same instructions. He took the gun and went into the room. All was quiet for about 5 minutes. The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried, but I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't have what it takes. Take your wife home.' Finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. He took the gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one after another. They heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'Some idiot loaded the gun with blanks' he said. 'I had to strangle that bitch to death'.

2	First-year students at Med School were receiving their first anatomy class with a real dead human body. They all gathered around the surgery table with the body covered with a white sheet. The professor started the class by telling them, "In medicine, it is necessary to have 2 important qualities as a doctor: The first is that you not be disgusted by anything involving the human body." As an example, the Professor pulled back the sheet, stuck his finger in the butt of the corpse, withdrew it, and stuck his finger in his mouth.    Go ahead and do the same thing," he told his students. The students freaked out, hesitated for several minutes, but eventually took turns sticking a finger in the butt of the dead  body and sucking on it.    When everyone finished, the Professor looked at them and told them: "The second most important quality is observation. I stuck in my middle finger and sucked on my index finger.    Now, "LEARN TO PAY ATTENTIONS!"

Just then, the person behind me tapped me on the shoulder and handed me a £50 note. I smiled at his generosity. Then majestically, I looked around, took my time and held the note stretched fully open over head level for everyone to see, slowly folded it and put the £50 note in the donation box, hoping people to think I've donated it and passed it on.  I then turned around and thanked the guy for being so generous.  He replied: "Don't mention it. Just Be more careful, there's another £50 note ready to fall from your pocket!!"

4	One day a man decided to retire. He booked himself on a Caribbean cruise and proceeded to have the time of his life, that is, until the ship sank...   He soon found himself on an island with no other people, no supplies, nothing, only bananas and coconuts.  After about four months, he is lying on the beach one day when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore.  In disbelief, he asks, "Where did you come from? How did you get here?"  She replies, "I rowed over from the other side of the island where I landed when my cruise ship sank."  "Amazing," he notes. "You were really lucky to have a row boat wash up with you."  "Oh, this thing?" explains the woman. " I made the boat out of some raw material I found on the island. The oars were whittled from gum tree branches. I wove the bottom from palm tree branches, and the sides and stern came from an Eucalyptus tree."  "But, where did you get the tools?"  "Oh, that was no problem," replied the woman. " On the south side of the island, a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock is exposed. I found that if I fired it to a certain temperature in my kiln, it melted into ductile iron and I used that to make tools and used the tools to make the hardware."  The guy is stunned.  "Let's row over to my place," she says "and I'll give you a tour." So, after a short time of rowing, she soon docks the boat at a small wharf. As the man looks to shore, he nearly falls off the boat.  Before him is a long stone walk leading to a cabin and tree house.  While the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only stare ahead, dumb struck.  As they walk into the house, she says casually, "It's not much, but I call it home. Please sit down." "Would you like a drink?"  "No! No thank you," the man blurts out, still dazed. "I can't take another drop of coconut juice."  "Oh, it's not coconut juice," winks the woman. "I have a still. How would you like a Tropical Spritz?"  Trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk. After they exchange their individual survival stories, the woman announces,  " I'm going to slip into something more comfortable. Would you like to take a shower and shave? There's a razor in the bathroom cabinet upstairs.  No longer questioning anything, the man goes upstairs into the bathroom. There, in the cabinet is a razor made from a piece of tortoise bone. Two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel mechanism.  "This woman is amazing," he muses. "What's next?"  When he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but some small flowers on tiny vines, each strategically positioned, she smelled faintly of gardenias. She then beckons for him to sit down next to her.  "Tell me," she begins suggestively, slithering closer to him, "We've both been out here for many months. You must have been lonely. When was the last time you played around? She stares into his eyes.  He can't believe what he's hearing. "You mean..." he swallows excitedly as tears start to form in his eyes,   "You've built a Golf Course too?"

1	Impeccable A woodpecker from the United States and a Canadian woodpecker were in Canada arguing about which country had the toughest trees. The Canadian woodpecker claimed Canada had a tree that no woodpecker could peck. The U.S. woodpecker accepted his challenge and promptly pecked a hole in the tree with no problem.  The Canadian woodpecker was amazed. The U.S. woodpecker then challenged the Canadian woodpecker to peck a tree in the U.S. that was absolutely 'impeccable' (a term frequently used by woodpeckers ). The Canadian woodpecker expressed confidence that he could do it and accepted the challenge.  The two of them flew to the U.S. where the Canadian woodpecker successfully pecked the so-called 'impeccable' tree almost without breaking a sweat.  Both woodpeckers were now terribly confused. How is it that the Canadian woodpecker was able to peck the U.S. tree, and the U.S. woodpecker was able to peck the Canadian tree, yet neither was able to peck the tree in their own country?  After much woodpecker pondering, they both came to the same conclusion: Apparently, the further you are from home the harder your pecker gets.

So he hit the guy upside the head with a lamp, knocking him out cold.  When the guy woke up, he was in the detached garage with his dick trapped in vise, with the handle broken off so there was no way to open it. He saw the husband dig in the tool chest and pull out a hack saw,  "OH MY GOD!" He screamed at the husband. "ARE YOU GOING TO CUT MY DICK OFF?"  "Nope," said the husband, tossing him the hack saw, "You are. I'm going to set the garage on fire."
1	Two guys are stuck in prison. Desperate to get back out and perhaps lead semi-regular lives, the two cellmates try to brainstorm for an escape plan. A mere hour and a half later, one of the men comes up with a plan: steal some children's craft scissors, smuggle them back to the cell, cut through the floor, and cut out a tunnel back to the surface when they're far enough from the complex.  During the unrealistically lax visitation sessions, one cellmate covertly swipes a pair of safety scissors when nobody is looking, and hides it in a body cavity. Miraculously, the scissors were not discovered during post-visitation searches, and they manage to get the craft scissors all the way back to their cell.  They spend all night trying to cut through the floor tiling with safety scissors, but all the scissors do is uselessly bonk on the linoleum, leaving hardly a scratch in the tiling over eight hours of attempted cutting. Come morning, they're still trying to cut through the floor with scissors, when the day guards catch them using contraband. While being apprehended, the cellmate who devised the plan says, "I don't understand. This seemed like a great idea on paper."

1	The Bus Driver and the Nun. A man gets onto a city bus and sees an attractive nun. Wanting to have sex with her, he goes up and asks, "Will you have sex with me?"  "Of course not!" the nun said unnervingly and got off the bus.  Before the depressed man left the bus, the bus driver stops him and says, "I know how you can screw her: On Sundays, she prays at the local cemetery. While she is praying, dress as God and she'll have sex with you. Put on a mask, robes, and a lot of glitter."  That Sunday, the man takes the advice, gets into the costume and hides behind a gravestone. Shortly, the nun appears and prays.  The man pops out from the gravestone and declares, "I am God, and I command you to have sex with me."  The nun replies, "Sure, but only if we have anal sex."  So they have anal sex.  After sex the man rips off his mask and laughs, I'm not God! I'm that man from the bus! Ha!"  Immediately the nun rips off her mask and says "Ha! I'm the bus driver!"

The doctor gave the man a jar and said, “Take this jar home and bring back a sample tomorrow.”  The next day the old man reappeared at the doctor’s office and gave him the jar, which was as clean and empty as on the previous day.  The doctor asked, what happened and the man explained.  “Well, doc, it’s like this . . . first I tried with my right hand, but nothing. Then I tried with my left hand, but still nothing. Then I asked my wife for help. She tried with her right hand, then with her left, still nothing. She tried with her mouth, first with the teeth in, then with her teeth out, still nothing. We even called up Arleen, the lady next door and she tried too, first with both hands, then an armpit, and she even tried squeezin’ it between her knees, but still nothing.”  The doctor was shocked! “You asked your neighbor?”  The old man replied, “Yep, none of us could get the jar open.”

2	A young man who barely looks of age walks into a bar... ...and orders a shot of whiskey.  After checking his ID, the bartender pours him one. The young man grabs the shot glass and throws it back, slams it down on the counter and orders another.  The bartender pours it and again the young man slams it back and demands one more. The bartender reluctantly pours him another, and as the young man slams that one back, the bartender looks at him.    "You want another? What's the rush?"  "Well, tonight I had my first blow job..."  "Hold on a minute," the bartender says, "I think I've heard this one before. You're expecting me to congratulate you and offer another on the house, but you're going to say no, if three whiskeys can't wash the taste out of your mouth, a fourth won't help."  "No," the young man shakes his head, "I'm just trying to build up the courage to explain to my Mom why the money I made at my summer job is going to go pay for my little sister's new iPhone."
1	In the year 2020, the Lord came unto Noah, Who was now living in America and said: “Once again, the earth has become wicked and over-populated, and I see the end of all flesh before me."  "Build another Ark and save 2 of every living thing along with a few good humans."  He gave Noah the blueprints, saying:  "You have 6 months to build the Ark before I will start the unending rain for 40 days and 40 nights."  Six months later, the Lord looked down and saw Noah weeping in his yard - but no Ark."Noah!," He roared, "I'm about to start the rain! Where is the Ark?"  "Forgive me, Lord," begged Noah, "but things have changed."  "I needed a Building Permit."  "I've been arguing with the Boat Inspector about the need for a sprinkler system."  "My homeowners association claim that I've violated the  Neighborhood by-laws by building the Ark in my back yard and exceeding the height limitations. We had to go to the local Planning Committee for a decision."  "Then the City Council and the Electricity Company demanded a shed load of money for the future costs of moving power lines and other overhead obstructions, to clear the passage for the Ark's move to the sea. I told them that the sea would be coming to us, but they would hear none of it."  "Getting the wood was another problem. There's a ban on cutting local trees in order to save the Greater Spotted Barn Owl."  "I tried to convince the environmentalists that I needed the wood to save the owls - but no go!"  "When I started gathering the animals, PETA took me to court. They insisted that I was confining wild animals against their will. They argued the accommodations were too restrictive and it was cruel and inhumane to put so many animals in a confined space."  "Then the Environmental Protection Agency ruled that I couldn't build the Ark until they'd conducted an environmental impact study on Your proposed flood."  "I'm still trying to resolve a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on how many minorities I'm supposed to hire for my building crew."  "The Immigration Dept. Is checking the visa status of most of the people who want to work."  "The labor unions say I can't use my sons. They insist I have to hire only union workers with ark-building experience."  "To make matters worse, the IRS seized all my assets, claiming I'm trying to leave the country illegally with endangered species."  "So, forgive me, Lord, but it would take at least 10 years for me to finish this ark."  "Suddenly the skies cleared, the sun began to shine and a rainbow stretched across the sky."  Noah looked up in wonder and asked, "You mean you're not going to destroy the world?"  "No," said the Lord. " The Government beat me to it.

3	Once management wants you fired, you’ll be fired A king had 10 wild ferocious dogs. He used them to torture and kill any minister that misguided him. A minister once gave an opinion which was wrong and which the king didn't like at all. So he ordered that the minister to be thrown to the dogs.  The minister said, "I have served you loyally for 10 years and you do this?”  The king was unrelenting.  Minister pleaded, "Please give me 10 days before you throw me to the dogs."  The king agreed. In those 10 days the minister went to the keeper of the dogs and told him he wanted to serve the dogs for the next 10 days.  The guard was baffled, but he agreed. So the minister started feeding the dogs, caring for them, washing them, providing all sorts of comfort for them. So when the 10 days were up. The king ordered that the minister be thrown to the dogs as sentenced.  When he was thrown in, everyone was amazed at what they saw. The dogs were wagging their tails playing with the condemned minister, licking his feet.  The king was baffled at what he saw. "What happened to the dogs? !!!" He growled.  The minister then said, "I served the dogs for only 10 days and they didn't forget my service. I served you for 10 years and you forgot all at the first mistake!"  The King realised his mistake and replaced the dogs with crocodiles!

1	One time there was a man with no money. He got a job as a train conductor. One day he walked up to a man on the train and shot him point-blank and stole his money.  Well, when everyone got off the train he was immediately arrested. He got sentenced to death by the judge and went to be executed by electric chair.  The executioner gave him his last meal, put him in the chair, and connected the wires. He pulled the switch, and nothing happened!  The law said the conductor was dead, so they had to release him.  Well, he went back to work, and got a job as conductor again! This time, he shot two men on the train and robbed them.   He was sentenced to death again, and the jail technicians were brought in to make sure the chair worked this time. The executioner gave him his last meal, and he pulled the switch.   Once again, nothing happened! They released him as the law required.  This time, he got a job as a conductor once again. He robbed and killed three men this time!   The judge sentenced him to death, they checked the chair even better this time, and they gave him his last meal. The executioner pulled the switch one more time.   It failed again! Not so much as a hair moved on his body. Before they released him, the executioner asked why he killed the men.   "Well, I don't have any money!", he replied.  "And why won't you die when we electrocute you?", the executioner asked.  "I told you, sir. I'm just a poor conductor!"

Thanks for the grub!"* and promptly receives incredible oral that leaves him breathless.  Thinking it would be a waste to leave now, he walks up to a second hole with a Japanese flag above it and inserts his johnson. From behind the wall, he hears *"Itadakimasu!"* and receives mind-blowing service that almost makes his knees buckle.  Excited to try another, he eagerly walks up to a third hole with a French flag above it and places his member into the hole. From behind the wall, he hears *"Bon appétit!"*, but quickly takes his junk back out. Confused, the French woman behind the wall peers through the hole and sees the man putting his pants back on with a sad expression and shuffling back to the exit, muttering *"...it's not THAT petite..."*

1	An old man was driving his old Fiat in the Italian countryside, when the car broke down He pulled over to the side, and called for a tow truck. While he was waiting, this guy in a Ferrari, who must have felt very generous that day, stopped and asked if he needed any assistance.    “It’s okay, the tow truck will be here soon,” the old man told him.    But the guy with the Ferrari said *he* could tow him, so that the old man could save the money for the tow truck. The old man eventually accepted his generous offer.  Fate would have it that as they were slowly making their way to the workshop, they were overtaken by a Porsche. Never in his life had the man in the Ferrari been overtaken by anyone, and now by a mere Porsche? He would have none of it! He slammed the gas pedal through the floor to catch up.   The poor old man, mercilessly on tow in his Fiat, realized he had been completely forgotten, and honked his horn to remind the Ferrari driver of his existence.  An Irishman, who was on holidays in the area, was walking alongside the road when they all passed by, well over the speed limit. He immediately called his friend back home:    “Hey Paddy, remember I told you the crazy Italians honk their horns whenever the traffic is slow? Well, you won’t believe it, but I just witnessed a Porsche and a Ferrari trying to set some kind of speed record, but an old man in a Fiat still deemed the traffic too slow!”

2	The waiter had a spoon in his pocket Last week, we took some friends out to a new restaurant, and noticed that the waiter who took our order carried a spoon in his shirt pocket. It seemed a little strange. When the waiter brought our water and cutlery, I noticed he also had a spoon in his shirt pocket. Then I looked around and saw that all the staff had spoons in their pockets.  When the waiter came back to serve our soup I asked, "Why the spoon?" "Well, "he explained, "the restaurant’s owners hired Andersen Consulting to revamp all our processes. After several months of analysis, they concluded that the spoon was the most frequently dropped piece of cutlery. It represents a drop frequency of approximately 3 spoons per table per hour. If our staff are better prepared, we can reduce the number of trips back to the kitchen and save 15 man-hours per shift."  As luck would have it, I dropped my spoon and he was able to replace it with his spare. "I’ll get another spoon next time I go to the kitchen instead of making an extra trip to get it right now." I was impressed.  I also noticed that there was a string hanging out of the waiter’s zip on his trousers. Looking around, I noticed that all the waiters had the same string hanging from their flies. So before he walked off, I asked the waiter, "Excuse me, but can you tell me why you have that string right there?"  "Oh, certainly!" Then he lowered his voice. "Not everyone is so observant. That consulting firm I mentioned also found out that we can save time in the rest-room. By tying this string to the tip of you know what, we can pull it out without touching it and eliminate the need to wash our hands, shortening the time spent in the rest-room by 76.39 per cent."  I asked "After you get it out, how do you put it back?"  "Well," he whispered, "I don’t know about the others, but I use the spoon."

2	Two great musicians hated each other And after years of always being compared to one another, they finally decided to have a duet of guitars to see which was the better player. They carefully selected an audience of musical experts, and with that they played.  After a fifteen minutes duet, the vote was cast. Amazingly, the results were a dead heat- half of the audience voted for one, half voted for the other.  Angrily, the first musician took out a clarinet.  “Let’s see how you manage THIS” he hissed at the second musician. The second musician dutifully brought out his own and they played. Thirty minutes later, both musicians tired but nonetheless angry, asked the audience to cast their vote.   The votes were tallied. Again, completely equal. Aghast but furious, the second musician brought out a piano, the first followed, and they played away. A full hour of a duet. Rachmaninov’s piano concerto in triple time, Flight of the forty million bumblebees. The musicians were exhausted but enraged. The vote cast. Another dead heat.  So it went on. Each duet a different instrument, a longer time, a dead heat. Bassoons, oboes, flutes, Swiss alpine horns, ouds, theremins, holophonors, the list went on.  Sweating profusely, absolutely livid, the first musician had enough. He staggered over and reached his hand into an ornate box. Suddenly the second musician, terrified thrust out his arm in desperation.  “NO! We must not resort to violins”

The first and second laughed at her saying that the quarter is too small...    And then a song started playing from inside the third woman.

As there was no electricity, the doctor handed the father-to-be a lantern and said, "Here..You hold this high so I can see what I am doing!" Soon, a baby boy was brought into the world.   "Whoa, there," said the doctor, "Don't be in such a rush to put that lantern   down - I think there's another one coming!" Sure enough, within minutes he had delivered a baby girl.   "Keep holding that lantern up - don't set it down! There's another one!!" said the doctor. Within a few minutes he had delivered a third baby. "No, don't be in a hurry to put down that lantern, it seems there's yet another one coming!" cried the doctor. The hillbilly scratched his head in bewilderment, and asked the doctor, "You   reckon it might be the light that's attractin' 'em?"

A married man arrives piss drunk to his home, he hardly makes it into his house after making a mess... in the morning he wakes up with a "breakfast for champions" in front of him, and he is like... what???...  He looks down to his in-bed breakfast and sees waffles, scrambled eggs with bacon, a glass of freshly squeezed orange juice, an ice cold beer, a couple of aspirins, and a note that simply says "*love you*".  He stumbles outside the room and sees broken glass, a broken lamp, mud (or vomit) in the carpet, half the clothes he was wearing the day before stinking of alcohol and cigarette laying in the floor... he has no idea what happened, so he calls for his son.  "where is your mom?" He asks.   "she went to the store to get a new door lock" The kid answers.  "ok... do you know what happened yesterday?"  "i sure do" says the kid; "you came home at around 5am drunk off your mind, you parked the car in the front lawn, after doing a couple of *doughnuts* on the front lawn with the car, then, you couldnt fit the key on the front door, and started knocking the door really hard and yelling for us to open, waking the neighbors that where still not awake because of the car parking, but you didnt wait for us, so you ended up kicking open the door after failing to force your way in..."  "...afterwards, you stumbled into the table at the entrance breaking the lamp grandma left mom before she passed away..."   "...after that, you tried to go up the stairs, and knocked off the wall most of the framed pictures we had hanging, thats when you vomited all over yourself."  "So, what happened then?" asked the still hung over man.  "Me and mom reached you half way up the stairs and understood you couldnt be talked to, so we dragged you up the stairs, by then you where trying to undress yourself, but couldnt really do it. You only got half your shirt off so mom unbuttoned the rest and then reached for your pants..."   "And then what happened????"  "Well, mom was trying to take your vomit soaked pants off when you very strongly pushed her aside, and yelled, "KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF ME YOU WHORE! IM A MARRIED MAN!" just before blacking out.
2	For my next trick I will disappear Fuck you pear, you taste like shit
1	It's my cake day, so here's a classic! There was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. So he went to a sex shop and started looking around. He goes up to the clerk and explains his situation. The old man said, "Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, strap ons, eggs, bullets, wing-wangers and fling-flongers..."  The Businessman interrupts, "None of those will do, I need the most top-of-the-line stuff you have! Isn't there something special, maybe in the back?"  but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped. "Except what?" the man asked. "Nothing, nothing." "C'mon, tell me! I need something!" "Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'" "So what's up with this voodoo dick?" he asked.  The old man nods, goes in the back for a minute, and comes back with an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo.   The businessman laughed, and said "Big deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"   The old man replied, "But you haven't seen what it'll do yet." He pointed to a door and said "Voodoo Dick, the door!"   The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle.   Before the door could split, the old man said "Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"   The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more.   "I'll take it!" said the businessman, awestruck with what he has seen.  The old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $1500 in cash.   The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say "Voodoo dick, my pvssy." He left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.  After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said "Voodoo dick, my pussy!" The voodoo dick got to work. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.   After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked.   Her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo.   On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.  The officer looked at her for a second, and then said "Yeah, right.. Voodoo dick, my ass!"
