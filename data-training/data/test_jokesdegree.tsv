The Receptionist replied; "Now you've caused some embarrassment in this room full of people. You should have said there is something wrong with your ear or something and discussed the problem further with the Doctor in private."  The man replied, "You shouldn't ask people questions in a room full strangers, if the answer could embarrass anyone. The man walked out, waited several minutes and then re-entered.  The Receptionist smiled smugly and asked, "?Yes??"  "There's something wrong with my ear", he stated.   The Receptionist nodded approvingly and smiled, knowing he had taken her advice. "And what is wrong with your ear, Sir??"  "I can't piss out of it," he replied.  The waiting room erupted in laughter.   Mess with seniors and you're gonna lose!

It's been so long since I was even in that part of the city."  So Morris goes down there, and to his amazement, Gelbstein's Shoe Repair is still there, and through the window he actually sees old Mr. Gelbstein behind the counter. He was sure that the shoes would be long gone, but it wouldn't hurt to ask, so he walked into the shop and greeted the old man, and showed him the 40-year-old ticket. "You wouldn't by any chance still have these shoes, would you?"  Gelbstein took the ticket, said "Let me check," and toddled off into the back. Then he called out, "Here they are!"  "Man, this guy is amazing," thought Morris. Gelbstein comes back out and gets behind the counter. He hands back the ticket to Morris, and tells him, "They'll be ready on Tuesday."

2	Why I Fired My Secretary Last week was my birthday and I didn't feel very well waking up on that morning.      I went downstairs for breakfast hoping my wife would be pleasant and say, 'Happy Birthday!', and possibly have a small present for me.      As it turned out, she barely said good morning, let alone ' Happy Birthday.'      I thought...      Well, that's marriage for you, but the kids...they will remember.      My kids came bounding down stairs to breakfast and didn't say a word. So when I left for the office, I felt pretty low and somewhat despondent.      As I walked into my office, my secretary Jane said, 'Good Morning Boss, and by the way Happy Birthday ! ' It felt a little better that at least someone had remembered.      I worked until one o'clock, when Jane knocked on my door and said, 'You know, it's such a beautiful day outside, and it is your Birthday, what do you say we go out to lunch, just you and me.' I said, 'Thanks, Jane, that's the greatest thing I've heard all day. Let's go !'      We went to lunch. But we didn't go where we normally would go. She chose instead at a quiet bistro with a private table. We had two martinis each and I enjoyed the meal tremendously.      On the way back to the office, Jane said, 'You know, it's such a beautiful day...we don't need to go straight back to the office, do we ?'      I responded, 'I guess not. What do you have in mind ?' She said, 'Let's drop by my apartment, it's just around the corner.' After arriving at her apartment, Jane turned to me and said, ' Boss, if you don't mind, I'm going to step into the bedroom for just a moment.  I'll be right back.'      'Ok.' I nervously replied.      She went into the bedroom and, after a couple of minutes, she came out carrying a huge birthday cake ..followed by my wife, my kids, and dozens of my friends and co-workers, all singing 'Happy Birthday'.      And I just sat there...      On the couch...      Naked.

There stood a redhead. Nothing more, just a red head. Then up the stairs strode a brunette, she took my hand. I asked for it back.   She told me of a friend who was dying, so I decided to go and see him. We took the lift to the ground floor. It was rather heavy, but we got there eventually.   I said to the porter, “Call me a taxi.” So he said “Sir, you’re a taxi.” The taxi pulled up with a jerk. The jerk got out and we got in.   We arrived at the dying man’s house, where I discovered he had swallowed a chicken bone. I said “does it hurt?” and he said “only when I laugh.” So I told him a joke and he died laughing

When he explained this to the doctor, the doctor understandably said, "I can't treat someone without seeing them! Bring her with you tomorrow"  But the man pleaded, "Please doctor, just tell me what I should do. I'll do it myself without letting my wife understand what's going on"   Finally, the doctor agreed, "Okay, I want you to do a little experiment. Stand 15 feet away from her and ask her a normal question then see if she responds. If she doesn't, move 3 feet forward and ask. Keep doing this until she responds and tell me how far she was from you when she responded"  The man thought it was simple enough and put to work straight away.     She stood 15 feet away from her wife and asked "What's for dinner today?" and there was no response.     He thought that his wife really does have a hearing problem and moved 3 feet forward and asked again, "What's for dinner today?"     No response.  Another 3 feet forward and again, no response.  He thought that his wife's hearing must be really bad, so again repeated the process.     "Honey, What's for dinner today?"     Finally she replied, "How many times do I have to tell you!? It's meatloaf!"

1	So I was about to propose to my girl friend when. . .     My roommate Joseph, barged into the room out of no where and tripped over a glass table, breaking it with his face. Totally ruining the mood.  Now I don't know Joseph that well, don't even know where he's from, but I decided to put my plans on hold to help him with his injury.  Joseph had gotten a shard of glass in his eye and was completely blind in it. Because of this he wore a cotton pad in his eye for a couple months, then he disappeared, along with my girlfriend.  Apparently they'd bonded during the months when he was recovering and eloped, didn't even leave me a note. I'd tried to track them, but like I said, I didn't know where he was from so I never was successful.   TLDR: If it hadn't been for cotton eyed joe, I'd been married long time go, where did you come from where did you go? Where did you come from cotton eyed joe?

He took her to the range and told her to hit a ball so he could assess her swing. She did and the ball went 10 feet out in front of her. He suggested she adjust her stance. Same result. 10 feet     After multiple attempts of trial and error he said, “Your problem has to be in your grip. I want you to hold the club like you hold your husbands penis”   The lady tries this and the ball goes 250yards and straight.  The pro says,” That’s fantastic! Now this time try it with the club not in your mouth”

3	Three men arrive in Heaven at the same time. As they approach the Pearly Gates, Saint Peter appears before them.   "The rules are simple: to get into Heaven, first you have to tell me how you die. If I'm satisfied with your story, you can come in."  The first man steps forward.  "Imagine this. You come home to your sixth-floor apartment to another man's clothes at the foot of you and your wife's bed. I didn't have to imagine, and I didn't stand for it. I had to look for this bastard. So I ran around, searching high and low, until I found someone hanging on to the window sill. I hit his fingers until he falls all six stories but he somehow survives by falling onto some trash bags. I grab the nearest heavy object-which happens to be the refrigerator-and throw it down at him. In my anger, I didn't realize that the plug had wrapped around my ankle, so I ended up falling to my death."  "Well," said Peter, "Normally we don't allow murderers in here, but I think it was for a righteous enough reason. You pass."  As the first man walks into Heaven, the second man steps forward.  "Imagine this. You're a window washer, doing your rounds on the seventh floor of an apartment building. You slip and fall, but somehow you catch yourself on the window sill of the floor below. All of a sudden, this random asshat starts smashing at your fingers. Anyways, I fell and my life flashed before my eyes. By some miraculous fate, I was somehow safe! I had landed on some garbage bags and survived. Then I look up and see a fridge falling from the sky."  Peter laughed. "Well, I don't think you did anything particularly wrong. You can come in."  As the second man entered the gates, Saint Peter turned to the last man. "What about you?"  "So imagine you've just finished fuckin' some dude's wife. Then you hide in the refrigerator."

While there, a stunning young woman came out of the apartment next to the mailboxes wearing only a robe. The boy smiled at the young woman and she started up a conversation with him. As they talked, her robe slipped open, and it was obvious that she had nothing else on. The poor kid broke into a sweat trying to maintain eye contact.  After a few minutes of flirting, she placed her hand on his arm and said, "Let's go to my apartment, I hear someone coming."  He followed her into her apartment; she closed the door and leaned against it, allowing her robe to fall off completely. Now nude, she purred at him, "What would you say is my best feature?"  Flustered and embarrassed, he finally squeaked, "It has to be your ears."  Astounded, and a little hurt she asked, "My ears? Look at these breasts; they are a full 38 inches and 100 percent natural. I work out every day and my ass is firm and solid. I have a 28 inch waist. Look at my skin, not a blemish anywhere, how can you say the best part of my body is my ears?"  Clearing his throat, he stammered, "Outside when you heard someone coming... that was me"
2	Once there was a polar bear named Jerry. Jerry hated living at the north pole and constantly bitched about it to the other polar bears.   “It’s too fucking cold here” he said. “The water is all frozen, there’s nothing to eat but penguins and I’m constantly covered in fucking snow”.

Jerry turned around and standing there was a brown bear.   “We have a wonderful home here. You are more than welcome to stay” said the brown bear.   “No thanks” said Jerry. And he turned and left back to the north pole.

But then this polar bear came out of the woods covered in *shit*“.

The doctor replies "There is, it's quite easy, choose a moment when she has her back to you, say something in a normal voice and if she doesn't answer, move a little nearer and say it again and you'll get an idea about her hearing"  So when he comes home from work, his wife is standing with her back to him in the kitchen.  He says "What's for dinner love?" but gets no answer.  He moves in a little closer "What's for dinner love?" again, no response  moves in again "What's for dinner love?" - nothing.  By now he's right behind her, he says again "What's for dinner love?"  She turns round and says "For the fourth time - chicken!!"  (stolen from the Edinburgh Fringe RHLSTP interview with Barry Cryer)

2	A man walked into a restaurant with a full-grown ostrich behind him As he sat down, the waitress came over and asked for their orders. The man said, "I'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke." Then he turned to the ostrich and asked, "What's yours?" "I'll have the same," said the ostrich.  A short time later the waitress returned with the order saying, "That will be $6.40 please." So the man reached into his pocket and pulled out the exact change for payment.   The next day, the man and the ostrich came again and the man said, "I'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke." Then the ostrich said, "I'll have the same." Once again the man reached into his pocket and paid with exact change.   This became a routine until late one evening, the two entered again. "The usual?" asked the waitress. "No, it is Friday night, so I will have a steak, baked potato, and salad," said the man. "Same for me," said the ostrich. A short time later the waitress came with the order and said, "That will be $12.62." Once again the man pulled the exact change out of his pocket and placed it on the table. The waitress couldn't hold back her curiosity any longer.   "Excuse me, sir. How do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?" "Well," said the man, "several years ago I was cleaning the attic and I found an old lamp. When I rubbed it a Genie appeared and offered me two wishes. My first wish was that if I ever had to pay for anything, I would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there." "That's brilliant!" said the waitress. "Most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!" "That's right. Whether it's a gallon of milk or a Rolls Royce, the exact money is always there," said the man. The waitress asked, "One other thing, sir, what's with the ostrich?" The man sighed, paused, and answered, "My second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything I say."
1	My grandfather died and I inherited some of his clothes.  He was a poultry farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. My grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.  After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken activities. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.  When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.  Why am I telling you all of this backstory? Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.

2	A gorilla dies of old age at a zoo right before it opens. It’s the only gorilla as they are not very profitable. However, the gorilla is their most popular attraction by far, and they can't afford to go a day without it. So the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.  Quickly, the new "gorilla" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. People from all over are coming to see the "Human-like" gorilla.  About a month in, the craze has started to wear off. So, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions' den next to him. A large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and terror. Suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lion's den. The man starts screaming "HELP!! HELP!!!" Suddenly a lion pounces him from behind and whispers in his ear, "Shut the fuck up right now or you're going to get us both fired."
1	Just in time for the farmers thanksgiving. NSFW There was this farmer that every morning would wake up and the first thing he would do is fart. Wet farts, dry farts, stinky farts, and especially loud farts. His wife would constantly tell him, “Honey, you really need to go to the doctor and have them look at that, one day you’ll end up farting your guts out.” And every time he just rudely brushes her off and never goes to the doctor.   Well, along comes thanksgiving day and the wife gets up really early in the morning to start preparing the big meal. She gets the turkey to start preparing it, she reaches inside to pull the innards out and a lightbulb goes off in her head. Knowing that her husband is a heavy sleeper, she sneaks back into the bedroom with the turkey guts and slips them into his underwear. Giggling to herself she heads back to the kitchen and gets back to working on the dinner.   A while later, sure enough she hears him let one rip she could hear it all the way in the kitchen. It’s immediately followed by a blood curdling scream. She laughed to herself and just goes back to work. A short while later, her husband walks into the kitchen fairly proud of himself and says; “Honey, you were right, I should have gone to a doctor about that fart. Cause this morning I did fart my guts out.” Excitedly he holds up 2 fingers and exclaimed “But by god, with these 2 fingers, I got em back in!”

1	Translated a joke from Swiss German. (It was a while ago since I heard the joke, so I don't remember it well) A man died and was on his way to heaven. When he reached, he saw Jesus standing Infront of him. Jesus said: "We have a long way ahead of us. Come...let's walk."  Jesus trying to start a small talk with the man, asked him whether he has has any pet peeves. The man replied: "I don't like it when people stoop down in front of me". Curiously Jesus asks: "Oh, and why is that?". The man said: "It's something personal." Jesus being curious, purposely dropped a key infront of him, and bent down. Suddenly the man grabs Jesus by the back and fucks him in he ass. Shocked beyond belief, pushed the man away and sent him to hell.  A few days later heaven started to get cold. Jesus thought to himself: "Tch, seems like Satan isn't heating up properly down there". So Jesus goes down to visit him.  But to his surprise, he sees Satan sitting and weeping in a corner. The man was standing and watching Satan cry. Jesus asks him:"Why are you crying and not heating up? All I asked you to do was throw in the coal. Was it really that difficult that you have to cry?"  Satan weepingly says: "All you have to do is throw coal, right?! THEN BEND OVER AND PICK IT UP!"

1	An Israeli businessman accidentally sleeps through his alarm one morning. Feeling the panic of waking up late, he throws on his suit as quickly as he can and rushes out the door to drive to work. As he begins the commute through the Tel Aviv rush hour traffic, he painfully watches the clock as his meeting starts without him.   Finally he pulls into his parking lot, fearing how much trouble he will be in, and he cannot for the life of him find a parking spot. After endlessly searching, in his desperation he stops his car and looks up towards the heavens and pleads, “Dear God, if you please just give me a parking spot I promise I will go to synagogue every week, and I will only eat kosher, and I’ll follow all the 10 commandments, just PLEASE give me a spot so I don’t lose my job!”  Miraculously, a parking spot opens up right by the front of the building. He looks back up to the heavens and says, “never mind I just found one!”

1	The Horse Challenge (LONG)  Every year, during fair season, a local farmer takes his horse and sets up a booth at various fairs. The rules are simple and the reward is great; make his horse nod yes and then shake his head no- doing this earns a $500 prize.     As it so happens fair season is in full swing, and the farmer is making a killing at $5 per attempt. A young man named Johnny decided to check out the festivities this year. He was strolling through, checking out the games, rides, food, and happens to see a pretty lengthy line for this one event. Johnny stops and asks an older gentleman in line what’s going on, and he learns about the “horse challenge”.    He thinks to himself, “nothing to lose, ought to be fun”. Eventually he makes his way to the front and it’s finally his turn. He walks into the pen eying the horse and sizing him up. He pauses, looks at the farmer and asks, “any rules?”. The farmer replies, “nope, make ‘em say yes or no.”     With that Johnny faces the horse, strolls over to the wooden fence, and picks up two halves of a brick. He then casually walks up to the horse, and with one brick smacks the horses left nut, causing the horse to raise his head up and down in pain. Johnny then claps the horses right nut making the beast shake his head violently left, and then right. The farmer begrudgingly hands Johnny his winnings and packs up shop, moving to the next fair.    The farmer is hitting his last event of the season, and is now charging $10 per attempt and increased the prize to $1000. Again, Johnny is at this same fair and notices the event. Eventually it’s his turn, but the farmer remembers him from last time and tells him, he can only speak to the horse, can’t use any objects or make any crazy movements. Johnny agrees to the terms and steps into the wooden pen once again.    As before, he eyeballs the horse and it stares back at him. Johnny walks up to the great beast, looks him dead in the eyes, and asks the horse, “you member me?” To which the creature slowly nods his head yes. “Want me to get them bricks?” The horse shakes his head from left to right very quickly. Jonny collects his winnings and is forever banned from attempting that farmers event.

1	Italian Wedding Test!  I was a very happy man.   My wonderful Italian girlfriend and I had been dating for over a year, and so we decided to get married.   There was only one little thing bothering me....It was her beautiful younger sister.   My prospective sister-in-law was twenty-two, wore very tight mini skirts, and generally was bra-less.   She would regularly bend down when she was near me, and I always got more than a nice view.   It had to be deliberate.   Because she never did it when she was near anyone else.  One day her 'little' sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations.   She was alone when I arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome.   She told me that she wanted me just once before I got married and committed my life to her sister.   Well, I was in total shock, and couldn't say a word.   She said, 'I'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.'   I was stunned and frozen in shock as I watched her go up the stairs.   I stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight to the front door.   I opened the door, and headed straight towards my car.  Lo... And behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!   With tears in his eyes, my father-in-law put down his shotgun and hugged me and said, 'We are very happy that you have passed our little test. We couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. Welcome to the family.'   And the moral of this story is:  Always keep your condoms in your car !

Not to worry though, the plane can fly fine with three engines, it just means a half hour delay to our arrival time, our sincere apologise.   The two friends look at each other and shrug their shoulders  An hour later the pilot makes another announcement:  Pilot: ladies and gentlemen, it appears a second engine has also failed, however the aircraft will not be impacted except for a further hour delay to our arrival time, again, we do apologise and thank you for your understanding.  The two friends sigh and settle in to watch an extra movie  Another hour passes and the pilot makes another announcement:  Pilot: ladies and gentlemen, in an unprecedented event, a third engine has also now failed. Fortunately these aircraft are built to be able to fly on one engine when necessary, so nothing to be concerned about. We will, however, be delayed by an extra two hours. I would like to apologise once again on behalf of our airline.  The two friends look at each other, shake their heads and roll their eyes.   Another hour later the pilot can be heard on the PA again but this time with a distinctly sombre tone to his voice.  Pilot: ladies.... ladies and gentlemen....... I.... I am afraid we have lost power in our fourth and final engine.....  Before the announcement could finish one friend looks at the other and says:  "For fucks sake! At this rate we'll be up here all fucking night!"

Suddenly this one lady in the cabin caught sight of the title and immediately started a ruckus. She snapped at how inappropriate it is for someone in the modern age to read that regressive book. She even went on to call me a Nazi and continued rebuking me for the deplorable act.

I elucidated to her how someone can simply read the said book just to satisfy one's curiosity regarding Hitler's psychology and yet not be appealed to fascism.  She backed down a bit but still eyed me with suspicion.  What a rude woman!  When I embark on my journey of cleansing the world of worthless people, she will be the first to go.

2	Sikh Joke Each Friday night after work, Sardar would fire up his outdoor grill and cook a tandoori chicken and some meat kebabs. But, all of his neighbors were strict Catholics ... and since it was Lent, they were forbidden from eating chicken and meat on a Friday.  The delicious aroma from the grilled meats was causing such a problem for the Catholic faithful that they finally talked to their Priest. The Priest came to visit Sardar and suggested that he become a Catholic. After several classes and much study, Sardar attended Mass... and as the priest sprinkled holy water over him, he said, You were born a Sikh, and raised a Sikh, but now, you are a Catholic."  Sardar's neighbors were greatly relieved, until Friday night arrived. The wonderful aroma of tandoori chicken and meat kebabs filled the neighborhood. The Priest was called immediately by the neighbors and, as he rushed into Sardar's backyard, clutching a rosary and prepared to scold him, he stopped and watched in amazement.  There stood Sardar, holding a small bottle of holy water which he carefully sprinkled over the grilling meats and chanted: "Oye, you were born a chicken, and you were born a lamb, you were raised a chicken and you were raised a lamb but now you are a potato and tomato"

The convent provided all of their basic needs: cows for milk, sheep for cheese, grain for bread, and even bees for honey.  However, one day a deadly plague swept through the land, infecting all of the sisters.  Desperate for a cure, their mother superior prayed continuously for seven days and seven nights for a miracle.  On the last day of praying, the mother superior opened her eyes to the sight of one of her beehives glowing with a brilliant blue flame.  Being a person of profound faith, she immediately rushed over to the hive and started scooping out globs of golden liquid and feeding it to her sisters.  Within seconds, all of their fevers had subsided and all of their plague sores had disappeared.  As they started rejoicing at this miracle, an angel appeared and told them that because of the strength of their faith, God had deemed them all worthy of this magical elixir of healing.  And as long as they kept it a secret to all but those who were pure of heart, God would continue to bless them with this miracle cure-all.  And so the sisters of the convent pledged to keep it a secret, sharing its existence and passing down the care of the hive to only the purest and most devout nuns, generation after generation.  However, as the years grew, the world's faith dwindled until all that remained of the convent was a lone sister of God.  Desperate to keep her convent's tradition and secret alive, she decided one day to journey out of the woods in search of a girl who was pure of heart.  After watching many of the townsfolk, she finally saw a young girl who showed great promise.  So the nun approached the girl and explained that she was the keeper of an amazing secret, but that this secret could only be shared with a pure soul.  "Well, how do I know if I'm pure enough?" the young girl asked.  The sister thought about this for a moment and replied, "Try praying continuously for seven days and seven nights, stopping only for sleep and food when necessary.  At the end, surely God will send us some sign of your purity."  And so the young girl locked herself in her room and did as the nun asked.  But after seven days and seven nights, neither saw any sign from God.  "Hmmm," thought the nun.  "Maybe you didn't pray long enough?  Try praying continuously, but this time for 30 days and 30 nights."  Trusting the holy woman, the young girl agreed and locked herself in her room again, this time for 30 full days and 30 full nights.  However, once again, no sign from God appeared.  Starting to lose faith herself, the old nun suggested that the girl simply needed to pray even longer -- this time for a full year to once and for all prove to God the purity of her soul.  Reluctantly, the young girl agreed.  But after six months of near-constant prayer, the girl had finally reached her breaking point.  Enraged, she confronted the old nun.  "You told me that if I prayed continuously for an entire year, this would prove the purity of my soul and you would finally share with me some amazing secret!  But after six whole months, I've had enough!  Either tell me what this amazing secret is or I quit!"  Dejected and having lost all hope, the old sister sadly looked at the young girl and replied, "it's a nun of yore's beeswax."
5	A woman decides to pick up a dozen bagels for her co-workers... ...so she stops by a local bakery on the way to work and there is a huge line.  She waits a while, gets up to the front, and tells the man behind the counter "I'd like a dozen bagels please".  "I'm sorry, but we're out of bagels."  The woman says never mind then and proceeds to leave the store.  On the way back to her car though she thinks "wait, it's a bakery, they'll make more."  So she gets back in the long line and waits and waits, and when she finally gets back up to the front she says "I'd like a dozen bagels please."  The man recognizes the lady and says, a little more irritated than before, "I'm sorry lady, we're out of bagels."  The woman walks away in a bit more of a huff, gets back to her car and actually starts it before deciding that she didn't like that guy's attitude, and if they don't have bagels by the time she gets up to the front of the line again she's going to complain to the manager.  So she walks back, waits in the line, and as soon as she gets back up to the front the guy behind the counter looks at her and says "Look, let me see if I can put this in terms you can understand.  Can you spell 'cat', as in 'catastrophic'?  The woman is a little puzzled and says "uh, yeah, C-A-T".  "Good, now can you spell 'dog' as in 'dogmatic'?"  "Yes, D-O-G".  "Great, now can you spell 'fuck' as in 'bagels'?"  Confused, the woman replies "There's no 'fuck' in 'bagles'"  "THAT'S RIGHT!!  THERE'S NO FUCKIN' BAGELS!!"

My girlfriend always painted her nails black and her brother had a massive cock.

2	Mark, The banker, saw his old Nebraska friend Bob, an eighty-year old rancher, in town... Bob had lost his wife a year or so before and rumor had it that he was marrying a "mail order" bride. Being a good friend, the banker asked Bob if the rumor was true. Bob assured him that it was. The banker then asked Bob the age of his new bride to be.    Bob proudly said, 'She'll be twenty-one in November.'  Now the banker, being the wise man that he was, could see that the sexual appetite of a young woman could not be satisfied by an eighty-year- old man. Wanting his old friend's remaining years to be happy the banker tactfully suggested that Bob should consider getting a hired hand to help him out on the ranch, knowing nature would take its own course. Bob thought this was a good idea and said he would look for one that afternoon.  About four months later, the banker ran into Bob in town again. "How's the new wife?" asked the banker.   Bob proudly said, "Good!  She's pregnant."   The banker, happy that his sage advice had worked out, continued, "And how's the hired hand?"   Bob smiled broadly and replied, "Oh, She's pregnant too."

1	A male gorilla at the zoo had been separated from his mate for several months and was really horney.  One night after the zoo had closed and all the animal keepers had left, he decided he was going to tear the bars apart and screw the first thing he could find. As he left his cage and ran through the zoo he came upon a lion sleeping in the grass. He really wasn't thrilled with his find but since he had promised himself he would take the first thing he could get, he grabbed the lion and screwed it.   Just as the gorilla finished, the lion awoke and was really pissed. The lion started chasing the gorilla through the zoo and was beginning to gain on him. The gorilla turned a corner and saw a park bench with a newspaper on it. Thinking quickly, the gorilla sat down on the bench and held the newspaper in front of him like he was reading it. When the lion turned the corner he stopped at the park bench. Not knowing what was behind the newspaper he asked the reader if he had seen a gorilla run by.   From behind the paper, the gorilla said, 'You mean the one that screwed the lion?' The lion shook his head and shouted, 'Oh no! It's already in the papers!'
4	Many years ago during my married days, I accidentally overturned my golf cart.  Elizabeth, a very attractive and keen golfer, who lived in a villa on the golf course, heard the noise and called out: "Are you okay? What's your name?"  "It's John, and I'm okay, thanks," I replied as I pulled myself out of the twisted cart.  "John," she said, (firm loose breasts undulating beneath her white silky robe) "forget your troubles. Come to my villa, rest a while and I'll help you get the cart up later."  "That's mighty nice of you," I answered, "but I don't think my wife would like it."  "Oh, come on now," Elizabeth insisted.  She was so very pretty, very very sexy and very persuasive ... I was weak. "Well okay," I finally agreed but thought to myself, "my wife won't like it."  After a couple of restorative Scotch and waters, I thanked Elizabeth. "I feel a lot better now, but I know my wife is going to be really upset. So I'd best go now."  "Don't be silly!" Elizabeth said with a smile, letting her robe fall open slightly. "She won't know anything. By the way, where is she?"  "Still under the cart, I guess."

1	3 guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp   One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms "You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes." The first guy immediately blurts out "I want a billion dollars." POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says "I want to be the richest man alive." POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says "I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life." POOF, his arm starts rotating. The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: "I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth." POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says "I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want." POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says "I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die." POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions. The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says "I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die." POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says "I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever." POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says "My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth." POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: "I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years." Second guy smiles and says "Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed."  Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:"Guys, I think I fucked up."    (I know it's probably been posted many times before  here but it's such a classic)

Cabbie: "He always knew the quickest way to go in traffic and avoid traffic jams. Not like me, I always seem to get stuck in them. But Brian, he never made a mistake, and he really knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good. He would never answer her back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes highly polished too. He was the perfect man! He never made a mistake. No one could ever measure up to Brian Sullivan!"  Passenger: "An amazing fellow. How did you meet him?"  Cabbie: "Well, I never actually met Brian. He died. I'm married to his fucking widow!"....

3	Little Johnny came into the kitchen where his mother was making dinner. His birthday was coming up and he thought this was a good time to tell his mother what he wanted. "Mom, I want a bike for my birthday." Little Johnny was a bit of a troublemaker. He had gotten into trouble at school and at home. Johnny's mother asked him if he thought he deserved to get a bike for his birthday. Little Johnny, of course, thought he did. Johnny's mother wanted Johnny to reflect on his behavior over the last year. "Go to your room, Johnny, and think about how you have behaved this year. Then write a letter to God and tell him why you deserve a bike for your birthday." Little Johnny stomped up the steps to his room and sat down to write God a letter.  Letter 1: Dear God, I have been a very good boy this year and I would like a bike for my birthday. I want a red one. Your friend, Johnny. Johnny knew that this wasn't true. He had not been a very good boy this year, so he tore up the letter and started over. Letter 2: Dear God, this is your friend Johnny. I have been a good boy this year and I would like a red bike for my birthday. Thank you. Your friend, Johnny. Johnny knew that this wasn't true either. So, he tore up the letter and started again. Letter 3: Dear God, I have been an OK boy this year. I still would really like a bike for my birthday. Johnny. Johnny knew he could not send this letter to God either. So, Johnny wrote a fourth letter. Letter 4: God, I know I haven’t been a good boy this year. I am very sorry. I will be a good boy if you just send me a bike for my birthday. Please! Thank you, Johnny. Johnny knew, even if it was true, this letter was not going to get him a bike.  Now, Johnny was very upset. He went downstairs and told his mom that he wanted to go to church. Johnny's mother thought her plan had worked, as Johnny looked very sad. "Just be home in time for dinner", Johnny's mother told him. Johnny walked down the street to the church on the corner. Little Johnny went into the church and up to the altar. He looked around to see if anyone was there. Johnny bent down and picked up a statue of Mary. He slipped the statue under his shirt and ran out of the church, down the street, into the house, and up to his room. He shut the door to his room and sat down with a piece of paper and a pen. Johnny began to write his letter to God.  Letter 5: God, I’VE KIDNAPPED YOUR MAMA. IF YOU WANT TO SEE HER AGAIN, SEND ME THE BIKE!!!

1	Sam was a man with big dreams who lived in a small countryside village One day, sam decided to follow his dreams and went to the big city. "Now you gotta find a job, Sam" he said to himself, and went to search for one.  After being rejected from several job interviews, Sam returns defeated to his home, there, he decides not to give up. With some money from his parents he travels back to the big city and opens his own business, a small pub he named "Sam's pub".  Soon the pub gets popular, and people starts calling it "Sub" for short. "Sub" becomes one of the city's main attractions, and Sam lives the good life. he buys himself a big house with a big yard and an expensive car. One day Sam decides to expend his business, and opens more and more branches. By the advice of his business consultor, he also adds a yard for every branch, to attract costumers.  Two months after, Sam goes to his largest "Sam's pub" branch to check it, and finds out the manager was doing a horrible job, even though he was supposed to be a professional, and was paid a very high salary. Sam realized finding a good manager is hard these days, so he decided to be the manager himself. He worked hard, but managed to handle the pub well.  Business was booming. Sam became very rich. One day he decided to change "Sam's pub" to "Sub", since people anyway call it "Sub". Sam soon found out it was a mistake. Subway sued his network for copyright, and he went to the sentence that had the chance to destroy his life.  After explaining the situation, the court and the judge let him go free of charge. He wasn't free from the situation entirely though. There was a small group of people that believed he bribed the judge, and wanted to bring down his business.

1	Ducking Awesome A girl asks her boyfriend to come over Friday night to meet, and have dinner with her parents. Since this is such a big event, the girl announces to her boyfriend that after dinner, she would like to go out and make love for the first time.   The boy is ecstatic, but he has never had sex before, so he takes a trip to the pharmacist to get some condoms.  He tells the pharmacist it's his first time and the pharmacist helps the boy for about an hour. He tells the boy everything there is to know about condoms and sex.   At the register, the pharmacist asks the boy how many condoms he'd like to buy, a 3-pack, 10-pack, or family pack. The boy insists on the family pack because he thinks he will be rather busy, it being his first time and all.   That night, the boy shows up at the girl's parents house and meets his girlfriend at the door. "Oh, I'm so excited for you to meet my parents, come on in!"   The boy goes inside and is taken to the dinner table where the girl's parents are seated. The boy quickly offers to say grace and bows his head. A minute passes, and the boy is still deep in prayer, with his head down.   10 minutes pass, and still no movement from the boy.   Finally, after 20 minutes with his head down, the girlfriend leans over and whispers to the boyfriend, "I had no idea you were this religious."     The boy turns, and whispers back, "I had no idea your father was a pharmacist."

She told me how he'd always wanted to buried in a grey suit, but she couldn't afford a new one, so I told her I'd see what I could do and to return in three days. After she'd left, I checked and he was about the same height and build as your husband so I swapped the heads.

" That's a terrible airline.  Their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late.  So, where are you staying in Rome?”     "We'll be at this exclusive little place over on Rome's  Tiber River called Taste.”    "Don't go any further.  I know that place.  Everybody thinks it's gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump.”    "We're going to go to see the Vatican and maybe get to see the Pope.”   "That's rich," laughed the hairdresser. ”You and a million other people trying to see him.  He'll look the size of an ant. Boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. You're going to need it.”   A month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo.  The hairdresser asked her about her trip to Rome.   "It was wonderful," explained the woman, "not only were we on time in one of United’s brand new planes, but it was overbooked, and they bumped us up to first class.  The food and wine were wonderful, and we had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on us hand and foot..           And the Taste hotel was great!  They'd just finished a $5 million remodeling, and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city.  They, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!”   "Well," muttered the hairdresser, "that's all well and good, but I know you didn't get to see the Pope.”            "Actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the Vatican, a Swiss Guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the Pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if I'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the Pope would personally greet us.       Sure enough, five minutes later, the Pope walked through the door and shook my hand!  I knelt down and he spoke a few words to me..”             "Oh, really!  What'd he say?”        He said: "Who screwed up your hair?

Over the next few months, they build a little community: all three craft little huts out of sticks and leaves, and they fairly split up all the tasks and chores essential to their survival. They even build a little church where they go to pray every Sunday.  But after a little while, everyone gets, well, restless. To be blunt, they're all horny and have no sexual outlets. Being devoutly religious people, pre-marital sex is out of the question.  So, they come up with a system. The woman marries one of the men for a week, then gets a divorce and marries the other man for a week. They just go back and forth like this.

But after eight months of this, the woman gets bit by a poisonous snake and dies.  The first week is really rough. The second week is even worse. The third week is just plain terrible. The fourth week is practically unbearable. So on the fifth week, >!they decide to bury the body!<
1	A lone traveler needed to stop and wait out a storm. A lone traveler needed to stop and wait out a storm. She came across a church settled near the top of a mountain far away from civilization, and decided to ask for them to lend hospitality to her. A nun greeted her at the entrance when she approached the church, and lead her inside. There, she was given food, water, and shelter for the night.   “You are free to roam and explore this church” the nun told her. “You are our guest and may do as you please. However, you aren’t to enter the basement under ANY circumstances.”  “Why not,” asked the traveler, confused. “What’s down there?” “I would tell you,” the nun spoke slowly with her head down, “but you’re not a nun.” The traveler thought the nuns demeanor was strange, but brushed it off.   When going to her bed for the night, the traveler passed by the basement. She heard strangle sloshing noises, like a damp rag, followed by the sound of a feral animal crying in pain. Disturbed, she found a nun in the church. “What the hell is going on in that basement,” she asked the nun. “I would tell you,” the nun said, “but you’re not a nun.”  “If I become a nun, will I be able to find out what’s in that damn basement,” asked the traveler, frustrated. “I mean, I guess so,” the nun shrugged. “But are you really willing to put in a lifetime worth of commitment just to know what’s in the basement?” The traveler nodded eagerly. Curiosity was ripping her to shreds.  So began her training. For many long years she prayed, preformed rituals, and learned the word of the Lord. Her connection with God strengthened, but so did her flaming need to know what the FUCK was in that basement. After long years of hard work, she finally earned her title as a nun.  “Since you are now a nun,” a nun and the church told her, “it’s about time I show you what’s in the basement. But first, you must pass a test of your faith. Tell me, which saint saw a flaming and winged figure in the sky when receiving the stigmata?”   “Why, St, Francis of Assisi of course,” the traveler replied confidently.  “Excellent. Next question, name a female saint who is not a doctor of the church.”  “St. Joan of the Arc, naturally.”  “Wonderful. Finally, who was the second Pope?”  “St. Linus. Sister, may I ask how this is a test of my faith?”  “I was just messing with you. Come now, I’ll show you the basement. I know the curiosity has been troubling your heart.”  Finally, after years and years of hard work, the traveler, now nun, was going to discover what was in the basement. She could hardly contain her excitement and pride of knowing the reward for her labor would be soon received. They went down the halls of the church, and to the basement door. The nun got out the sacred key to the door, opened it slowly, and she saw...  Oh, I would tell you, but you’re not a nun.

He led the way to his bedroom where there was a big brass Chinese gong and a mallet.  "What's with that big brass gong?" one of the guests asked.  "It's not a gong.  It's a talking clock," the drunk replied.  "A talking clock?? Seriously?" asked his astonished friend.  "Yup," replied the drunk.  "How's it work?" the friend asked, squinting at it.  "Watch", the drunk replied. He picked up the mallet, gave the gong an ear-shattering pound and stepped back.  The three stood looking at one another for a moment.  Suddenly, someone on the other side of the wall screamed,  "You asshole...it's three-fifteen in the morning!"

1	Guitar Horse A horse and his mother are in the barn watching TV when an ad comes on. It's for a music school that can teach anyone to play any insturment, guaranteed. The horse has always wanted to be play the guitar, so he calls them up.  "Hey, I want to learn to play the guitar," he says, "Can you teach me?" and the school responds, "Sure, we can teach anyone!" The horse says "But I'm a horse, is that a problem?" and the school days "No, come on down!"  A few weeks later, the horse is riffing on an electric guitar in the barn, which, of course, draws some attention. He's approached by the pig who asks, "Hey, how did you learn to do that?"  The horse says, "Well, there's a music school that can teach anyone to play any insturment." "Really?" asks the pig. "Guaranteed," the horse says.  So the pig calls up and says "Hey, I want to learn to play the keyboard," he says, "Can you teach me?" and the school responds, "Sure, we can teach anyone!" The pig says "But I'm a pig, is that a problem?" and the school days "No, come on down!"  A few weeks later, the pig is playing synth to back up the horse and it sounds pretty good, and it draws the attention of the chicken. She comes in and asks the horse and the pig, "Hey, how did you learn to do that?"  The horse says, "Well, there's a music school that can teach anyone to play any insturment." "Really?" asks the chicken. "Guaranteed," confirms the pig.  So the chicken calls up and says "Hey, I want to learn to play the drums," she says, "Can you teach me?" and the school responds, "Sure, we can teach anyone!" The chicken says "But I'm a chicken, is that a problem?" and the school days "No, come on down!"  A few weeks later they've got a hit little trio going, drawing in all the barn animals. A talent agent drives by and hears them, and stops to see what's going on. He signs them instantly and they take the show on the road.  The trio have a metoric rise to fame; gold records, sold out shows, screaming fans, national tours. They're all set for their first international tour, cruising around Europe with their music.  The band is about to get on the plane when the horse gets a phone call. It's his mother; she's become very sick and taken a turn for the worse. He has to go see her, and cen't get on the plane. His bandmates, great friends by now, tell him not to worry. They'll go on ahead and he can take another flight after he sees his mother.  They get on the plane and the horse goes home, but, he's too late. She's already passed, and he didn't get to see her that one last time. Although he is crushed with grief, he stays strong for his friends. He decides to dedicate this tour to his mother.  He calls his agent to get a flight to Europe, but he is told there's no tour. The plane with the pig and chicken exploded midair - something about a fuel line. No survivors.  The horse gets in his car and speeds into town; he needs to escape this. He drives around till he finds somewhere to park, then he gets out downtown.  The horse walks into a bar.  The bartender says, "Hey, why the long face?"
1	A boy and his dog    A young man walks into a bar, followed closely by a large ball of black hair. The bartender looks at him and says "We dont allow dogs in here!"  The young man responds, "That's not a dog, it's a wooleybugger."  "What's a woolybugger?" quips the bartender.   "Come outside and I'll show you" says the young man as he rises from his seat.  The bartender agrees and the three go out the front door of the bar.   Across the valley, there's a raccoon tipping over trashcans, spreading garbage everywhere. This infuriates the bartender and he starts to yell at the raccoon.  But the young man says "Hold on, sir. Allow me." He turns to the dark hairball and says, " Woolybugger that raccoon!" The hairball springs into action and just decimates the raccoon, there's still raccoon hair settling in the air as the woolybugger returns.  "Let me try!" exclaims the bartender, eyeing the big tomcat spraying the side of the bar. "Wooleybugger that cat!" And the ball of hair quickly eliminates the cat and returns to the young man's side.   "That's pretty impressive!" says the bartender,  "Let me buy you a beer."  Once in the bar, cold one in hand, the two chat about what had happened in the alley with much enthusiasm,  only to be interrupted by the town drunk dragging himself in and up to the bar.  "Give my a beer!" He demands. "Why the &*#@ is there a dog in here?"  "It's not a dog" replied the bartender. "Its a 'woolybugger'."  To which the drunk replied, "Wooleybugger my ASS!!"

1	Once upon a time, in a land far, far away there were two evil friars living outside this small village. The friars had tried unsuccessfully to overtake and capture the town, but finally this time, they believed they had hit upon a foolproof scheme that would allow them to rule the village. They had, through mad scientist experiments in their floral shop, come up with a plant that would devour the townspeople one by one until none were left. They set forth to put their plan into action by planting the man-eating plants so they encircled the village.   As the plants rapidly grew, they began devouring everything living in their path. The townspeople grew frightened; who or what would save them from their eminent doom? Finally, the town's elder remember Hugh, a woodcutter who lived on the outskirts of town. Frantically, the townspeople penned a desperate plea for help, tied it to the leg of a pigeon, and directed the bird toward Hugh's cabin.   Meanwhile, outside of town, Hugh had received the note from the townspeople, and realizing they were in grave danger, set forth to do what he needed to do. He honed his mightiest axe to razor-sharpness, grabbed his hat, and off he went.   Chopping his way through the dense vines, he single-handedly destroyed the carnivorous plants one by one, until all were destroyed. Then he set out to rid the village of the evil friars, chasing them out of town. The town was saved!!! The people rejoiced and knighted Hugh for his brave and timely efforts to save the village!!!   And the moral of the story is:   Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.

2	My grandfather died and i inherited some of his cloth He was a farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens.  For this occasion, my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.  After a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken things. I always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.  When he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. When my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and I smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.  Why am I telling you all of this back story? Because the last time I tried to tell this to someone and I didn't give context, they thought it was weird that I was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection

2	Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch.  Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch. Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull from the stockyard in a far town so that they can breed their own stock.  They only have $600 left. Upon leaving, the brunette tells her sister, 'When I get there, if I decide to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.'  The brunette arrives at the stockyard, inspects the bull, and decides she wants to buy it. The man tells her that he will sell it for $599, no less. She’s hesitant but knows it’s the right choice to save their ranch. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. She walks into the telegraph office and says, 'I want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.'  The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, 'It's just 99 cents a word.' Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.  After a few minutes of thinking, she nods and says, 'I want you to send her the word 'comfortable.'   The operator shakes his head. 'How is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word 'comfortable?'   The brunette explains, 'My sister's blonde. The word's big. She'll read it very slowly ... com-for-da-bull.'

So I put my soft pp into the hole of the DVD, and for a few seconds as I started getting harder, it felt pretty good, but then, once I was fully erect, it started being painful. My pp was stuck in the dvd, and I had to break it in half to get if out. It was then when I flipped the broken dvd over and realized that it was not a blank dvd, but a copy of the movie UP.  Well guys, guess I fucked up.

Looking at his son, panicking, the father starts shouting for help.  A well dressed, serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a nearby table reading from her laptop and sipping a cup of coffee.  At the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.  Reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants, takes hold of the boy’s testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.

Wandering around, the poor old dog notices a leopard coming rapidly in his direction with the intention of having lunch.  Just then, the old dog noticed some bones laying on the ground close by.  The dog immediately settles down to chew on the bones turning his back to the approaching leopard.  Just as the leopard is about to leap, the dog loudly says: "My, that was one delicious leopard! I wonder if there are any more around here?"  Hearing this, the leopard slinks away. "That was too close," thought the leopard, "that dog nearly had me."  Meanwhile, a mischievous monkey had observed the entire scene, and decided to cause trouble for the dog, while getting on the good side of the leopard as well.  The monkey dashed off after the leopard, to tell him what truly happened.  The dog saw the monkey dash off, and suspiciously tailed him from behind.  He overhears the monkey spilling the beans, and quickly decides on a course of action, racing back to the pile of bones.  At the same time, the leopard has decided to take care of the dog once and for all.  The monkey hops on the leopard's back, to watch the demise of the doomed dog.  As the leopard approaches, he can hear the dog talking to himself: "Where's that lazy monkey? I sent him off half an hour ago for another leopard, and he's still not back!"

2	By nature, Jason was very intelligent but a bit shy. One day he went into a bar, and he saw a stunningly attractive woman sitting alone at a table drinking a white-wine spritzer. Jason couldn’t take his eyes off this lady, and eventually, he gathered up the courage to walk across and speak to her.  “Hello, I’m Jason. Would you mind if I sat with you and chatted for a while?” asked Jason quietly but politely.  The woman responded by yelling at the top of her voice, “No! I will not sleep with you tonight!”  Jason blushed, beetroot red with embarrassment, and everyone in the bar looked over to see what was going on.  So he walked back over to the counter where he’d been sitting, reflecting on how he might have handled the situation and intending to leave the bar as soon as he'd finished his drink.  However, a couple of minutes later, the attractive woman walked over to him and apologized.  “I’m really sorry,” she said. “I’m actually a Ph.D. student at Harvard and I’m researching how people respond in embarrassing situations.”  To which Jason responded, yelling loudly at the top of his voice, “What do you mean you charge three hundred dollars minimum?!”
1	Reposts versus retellings. (Not a joke) I just wanted to make a quick PSA about jokes.  Jokes are meant to be retold. A good joke gets told a thousand times, and spreads like a virus. Like a virus a joke will often mutate and change as it passes from person to person, often tweaked for better performance.  Now, what is the difference between retelling a joke you heard and reposting it? It is a common question, apparently. Reddit, and the admins have made it fairly easy to tell the difference.  Take a scenario. You hear a joke from a friend, co-worker, family member. Maybe it was today, maybe you just remembered a joke from 30 years ago. But it made you laugh and you wanted to share it with the world. You take 2 minutes and search some keywords on the sub. If you saw the joke has been posted already, but told very differently, or a long time ago (mods say 1 month), you don't need to post it. If the joke hasn't been posted in a long time, or you have a major difference in how you tell it, feel free to post it. That's... why we're here.  Take another scenario. You saw a joke posted to this sub, you laughed and thought it was funny. You selected the text and copied the joke. A couple days later you make a post, pasting the test verbatim, and put it on this sub. That's not "retelling a joke," it's karma whoring, and corny. Would you at least make an effort to improve the joke some?   Some people have little imagination. That's fine. But if your entire contribution to the sub can be done by a bot that just recycles a post that was popular a little bit ago... Maybe refrain?

1	A stingy father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 18 year old daughter. A stingy father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 18 year old daughter.  He wanted the party to be extravagant, but wanted to spend as little money as possible. He had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.  "Why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *My daughter is inviting all of her friends, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake*, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.  How quaint, the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "Hello," the father asked, "I would like to buy a cake."  "Of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  The father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  The day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. All of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  The monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "Why do you do this for free? You should take money for your services!"  The monk smiled and said, "I do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."

1	A re-purposed religious joke for current events A man went out without a mask, and was met with glaring eyes everywhere he went. He finally got to the store when someone confronted him as he got in.   "Sir, I'm going to need you to put on a mask. It's policy to wear one when you come in" said the guard blocking the doorway.   "No! I don't need to wear it!" the man stated proudly. "I can't wear one because I have a medical condition!"  But the guard didn't budge, and he walked away in a huff. His smirk grew as more and more people sneered and avoided him. A few blocks down, another man tried to reason with him.  "Put on a mask, man! Don't you want everyone to be safe? We have kids and elderly dying everyday!" He said  "FAKE NEWS! FAKE NEWS! I don't need to worry about it, because it's all fake news!" His voice now getting louder. "Besides, I got god on my side! I won't ever get sick!" He strutted off the sidewalk, deciding to go the bar instead. But without looking, he didn't realize the truck coming his way. He was hit 10 feet across the street. He was unconscious until he was already in the ambulance. First thing he noticed was the mask on his face, and his arm limped to pull it off.  "Sir, you need to keep that on" warned the EMT. "We also need your blood type, do you know it?"  "I don't need this, I got god to protect me" he said faintly. Then he passed out again. They worked on him for 3 hours until he finally died.  He made it to heaven, and as he passed through the gates, he searched for god. He found him and confronted him.  "Where were you?? I thought you were going to protect me!" He shouted. "All my life I believed in you, and when I needed you most, you weren't there!"  Without blinking, god calmly stated "Of course I was there, I sent those men of science to protect you."

1	Moe’s Saloon in the Old West was seeing a lot of customers lately... It was getting busier and busier by the day, so much so that there was barely a seat left in the whole joint. The hotshots were playing poker, the 49-ers were drinking and cat-calling the dames. The piano was playing, the whiskey was flowing, everyone was having the time of their lives. Suddenly, the doors to Moe’s Saloon slam open. A scrawny, ragged, dirty little fellow starts screeching ‘Good folks, run for your lives! Terrible Jack’s on his way here!’. Everybody rushes to leave, it was every man for himself. Old Moe just locked away the good silverware and was about to leave when the doors slam open again. A huge, dark and stern cowboy starts for the bar. Every footstep was heavier than the last. Poor Moe froze behind the counter. The cowboy unzips his pants and slams against the counter this huge monster of a penis. Pointing at it, he tells Moe ‘Barkeep. Suck.  On. It. Fast.’ Poor Moe does as he’s told without a beat. The cowboy leaves.  Next day, same story. People having a blast, piano playing, whiskey flowing. The same haggard little man bursts in: ‘Good folks, run for your lives! Terrible Jack’s on his way here!’. Panic ensues, everyone leaves in a frenzied manner, except for poor old Moe, who, like a ship’s captain, was the one to stay behind. The same dark stern cowboy enters, advances to the counter, slams the hugest, ugliest phallus you’d ever seen, points at it and tells poor Moe ‘Barkeep. Suck. On. It. Fast.’ The old timer complies without a word.  Third day, yet again the same story. Wonderful time at Moe’s Saloon when a tiny little scamp enters and yells ‘Good folks, run for your lives! Terrible Jack’s on his way here!’. In a jiffy the place is emptied, old Moe rushes for the exit when he bumps into the dark stern cowboy entering. He points to the counter. Old Moe obeys the order. The cowboy advances, unzips his pants and slams his horrible shlong on the counter: ‘Barkeep. Suck. On. It. Fast’. Moe considers for a moment, and, mustering all his might, whispers: ‘Alright now, feller. Alright. I done sucked that thing two days ago. Didn’t even wince. I done sucked that thing yesterday, not a word said. Hell, I’ll suck on it today, I give you my word. But - for the love of God - would you kindly tell me why you want it fast? I’m an old man and can barely pee fast’  ‘Heaven’t. You. Heard? Terrible Jack’s on his way here!’

5	The year is 1939, and the USSR is invading Finland. The Soviet army is marching through the Finnish swamps when they hear shouting from the other side of a nearby hill:  "I bet one Finn can beat ten Soviets!"  The Soviet officer laughs at this and sends ten of his best soldiers to deal with this guy. After a couple of minutes of shooting they hear the voice again:  "I bet one Finn can beat a hundred Soviets!"  The officer, now enraged, sends a hundred soldiers to silence this cocky Finn. A few minutes of shooting and screaming later, the voice shouts again:  "I bet one Finn can beat a thousand Soviets!"  The officer is now absolutely furious with this enemy, but knows that nobody could possibly beat 1000 soldiers alone, so he accepts the challenge once more and sends 1000 of his men. Nearly 15 minutes of shooting, screaming, and bright flashes later, a lone Soviet soldier comes crawling back over the hill with severe burns, covered in blood and half of his leg mangled. Panicked, he yells to his comrades:  "Don't go up there! It's a trap! There are actually two of them!"

2	How Egyptians solve problems. In Cairo there is a large hole in the ground left over from a construction project that was never finished. Everyday several people unexpectedly walk right into the hole and are badly injured.   By the time the ambulance arrives and brings the victims to the hospital it is often too late to save them. To solve this dangerous predicament those with the highest positions in the Egyptian government hold a meeting.   "What shall we do about this hole plaguing our people?" Asks the first speaker. Everyone is hesitant to answer, but then a man raises his hand. "It is quite an easy solution" he exclaims.  "We keep an ambulance right next to the hole, so if people fall in they can be pulled out and brought to the hospital right away."  The council agrees and decides to implement this new solution the following day, however, with traffic there is still not enough time to get the victims to the hospital. So they hold another meeting.   "Having an ambulance ready is still not enough to save our people, we must do more."  A different man raises his hand and speaks,  "If getting to the hospital in time is the problem then we must build a hospital next to the hole" everyone claps seeing that they've found the solution. But then the urban development chair speaks in response to this proposal.  "The land next to the hole is simply not big enough" he says and the crowd stops clapping. "It seems we are back at step 1".  In the back of the room a man stands and says with much confidence, "I have got it! We shall bring a truck full of dirt to the site of the hole, and we will fill it up" the council is ecstatic clapping for the man.  "then we dig another hole next to the hospital".

1	A king was growing jealous of his new born Ever since his son was born, the king felt like everyone was paying more attention to his son than him. As days passed he was starting to get more and more jealous of his son for getting all the love and was starting to feel a pain growing in him knowing that he wasn't the center of the attention anymore. He even felt like the queen was starting to ignore him and was spending more time with their son.  Unable to bear the pain, the king decided that he didn't need a son like that. He asked the handmaid to discretely apply poison to the queen's nipples before she nurses the child that day. Then he left for hunting not wanting to be present at the palace when it happens. After an hour he returned back to the palace to find everyone with a sad face. Not wanting to look suspicious, the king put up a concerned face and asks a teared up chamberlain what was going on:  "Why does everyone have a sad face? What happened while I was gone that has this place mourning?"  "I am afraid I have a very terrible news your majesty... we found the...c..co..."  Unable to convey the news fully, the chamberlain takes a moment to compose himself before continuing "we heard the queen scream a few minutes ago so all of us rushed to see what happened, and that's where we found him dead"  The king puts on a very anxious face accordingly and asks in a shaky voice: "What? What happened? How did this happen?"  "We are not sure yet your majesty, we found him dead in your bedroom with a lot of foam from his mouth around a few minutes ago . We have asked the physician to come and take a look at what happened to determine the cause. This is very unexpected as he seemed very healthy and was meant to live much longer. I am very sorry for your loss, your majesty. He was definitely one of a kind courtier."  Edit: grammar

2	A rich man buys a new Lamborghini. It's the most expensive car in the world, and he wants to show it off, so he takes it out for a spin.  At the first stoplight, an ancient Moped pulls up next to him. The elderly cyclist stares at the sleek, shiny surface of the automobile and asks, "What kinda wheels ya got there, sonny?"  The man replies, "It's a Lamborghini. They go for about a million and a half."  The old guy is shocked: "That's a lot of moolah. Why do they cost so much?"  The cool man says proudly, "Because these babies can do 320 miles an hour!"  The gent on the Moped asks, "Can I take a look inside?"  "Sure," responds the owner. So the old man pokes his head in the window, and peers around.  Leaning back on his Moped, the old guy says, "That's a pretty nice car!"  Just then, the red light turns green, so the man decides to floor it. In no time, the speedometer reads 320. Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear-view mirror, which seems to be getting closer. He slows down to see what it might be, and whoooooosh! Something whips by him, at an incredible velocity.  The guy is astonished "What on earth could be faster than my car?!" Then, ahead of him, he sees the same dot, coming back. Whoooooosh! It goes by again, heading in the opposite direction. It almost looks like the old man on the Moped.  "Couldn't be," he mumbles to himself. "How could a Moped outrun my Lamborghini?!" Again, the blasted dot appears in his mirror. Whoooooosh! Ka-boooom! It plows into the back of his car, demolishing the rear end. The guy jumps out, and it IS the old fellow!  Of course, the Moped and its driver are hurtin' bad, so he kneels down by him and says, "You're seriously injured - is there anything I can do for you?"  The old guy moans, "Yes... unhook my suspenders from your side mirror."

2	A man walks into a bar he's never visited before, and settles down to order a drink.  Before long, he notices someone sitting in the corner - a man who appears normal in every regard except that his head is a gigantic orange. Curious, the newcomer asks the bartender "What's up with the guy in the corner? The one with the-" but the bartender interrupts and says "Honestly, your best bet is just to buy him a drink and ask him yourself."  So the newcomer buys two drinks and wanders over to the table in the corner. The man with a gigantic orange for a head looks up, sighs, and says "Let me guess. You're here to ask about my head being a gigantic orange, aren't you?" The newcomer replies "I'm sorry but I was just so curious", and he hands over the drink.  The man with a gigantic orange for a head shrugs and begins his story: "When I was a younger man, desperate for money, I would spend my days wandering the beach with a metal detector trying to find coins or scrap to sell. One day I found a strange object - an old oil lamp. I scooped the sand away and dusted the lamp off as best I could, and the lamp started to glow with an unearthly light. Before I could blink, a genie stood before me, majestic and bold!"  The newcomer looks skeptical. "A genie?" he says, "Yeah right!"  The man with a gigantic head for an orange just holds a hand up and continues with the story: "The genie promised me three wishes - anything I could desire! I thought long and hard, because I had read the tales of tricksy genies who would twist your words to change your wish into a dreadful curse. After pondering for an hour, I made my first wish - I wished to be so wealthy that I could live lavishly for my entire life without working another day, and the wealth must be my own wealth, obtained through both legal and ethical means. The genie simply nodded and when I checked my bank balance on my phone, it showed a balance of billions of dollars! I was instantly one of the wealthiest people in the world, and as far as I know the genie hadn't twisted my wish."  "Very clever," says the newcomer, "but that doesn't explain why your head is a gigantic orange! That's the part that I'm really interested in!"  "I'm getting to it," replies the man with a gigantic orange for a head. He orders another drink, and once the next round arrives he continues his story: "For my second wish, I still needed to make sure the genie couldn't twist my words against me. I worked for *two* hours to get the phrasing just right! Having found the right words, so careful that the genie couldn't find a loophole, I made my second wish - I wished to be loved by, and to love in return, the most perfect woman I could ever meet - suited to me physically, mentally, and emotionally. The genie simply nodded, and suddenly a beautiful woman came running down the beach toward me. She instantly declared her love for me, and we started dating - in fact, we're still happily married today, and she's just as beautiful and kind and passionate as the day I met her. As far as I know, the genie hadn't twisted my wish."  "Wow, that's a lovely part of the story," says the newcomer. "I'm glad it worked out well for you, but again I really must insist - please can you get to the part that explains why your head is a gigantic orange?!"  "Don't rush me," says the man with a gigantic orange for a head. Starting to slur a little, he calls for another drink. Once the bartender drops the drink at the table, the man with a gigantic orange for a head continues: "You've been asking about why my head is a gigantic orange, and here's where you get your answer. As you've heard, for my other wishes I was so careful, I spent *hours* thinking of the right thing to say, and those wishes brought me more happiness than you could ever know, but for my third wish... well, the third wish is where I made a foolish mistake. I'll regret it until the day I die, I can't *believe* I did something so stupid! You see, for the third wish, I wished my head was a gigantic orange."

1	A Few Very Important Lessons You Will Learn Only After You Have Kids A "King Style" water bed contains enough water to turn a 200 Sq m apartment into a 12 cm deep lake.  The voice of a 4 year old can deafen 200 normally talking adults in a crowded restaurant.   If you tie a dog leash to a room fan, the motor of the latter is not powerful enough to lift 23 kg youngster in a Superman costume into the air. However, it is powerful enough to evenly cover the walls of a 7x7m room with paint from the jar in the hands of the "Superman".  When the fan is turned on, baseballs should not be thrown at it.  The window glass, even double-glazed, is not an obstacle for a baseball hit by a fan blade.  If from the bathroom comes the noise of opening the toilet cabinet with your cosmetics, then the sound of glass and then a child's voice "Oooops, but I ....", it's already too late.  Breaks fluid mixed with chlorine-containing detergent, produces smoke. A lot of smoke.  A 4 year old CAN start fire with two stones, no matter how much we claim that this only happens in movies.  Cement paste and microwave are intolerable.   Super Cement is super cement. Even mixed by a 4 year old, it is forever. Even if it is not on a convenient place.  No matter how much fruit jelly you pour into the pool, it does not allow you to walk on water.   Pool filters don't like fruit jelly.  Glass balls in the fuel tank make a very unpleasant noise while driving.   It is better if you don't try where that smell comes from.  You should always look inside the oven before turning it on. Ovens are not particularly well suited to plastic toys.   It takes the fire department 6 minutes to get home.  The spin of the washing machine does not cause dizziness to earthworms.   The spin of the washing machine causes the cat to feel dizzy.   The cat can vomit almost as much as it weighs when dizzy.

1	Yesterday I went in for my yearly dental exam. I had forgotten my dentist had retired last year so I was a little surprised to see a new dentist waiting for me who, come to find out, had just graduated from dental school in russia. After exchanging greetings I sat down and he began his exam. As he was working I casually looked over at his wall decorations which included his certificate, pictures of his family and several wooden awards. One award in particular caught my eye, it was engraved with some russian words, had a golden emblem in the middle and appeared to be dotted with several strange holes. Intrigued, I asked him what it was to which he replied it was his graduation award. That no doubt explained the emblem and russian words but the indents still puzzled me so I asked what they were. He said that on the day of graduation every student was given his award with teeth attached to them which they then ceremonially removed upon receiving their certificate. This seemed like a strange custom to me so I asked if there was a deeper meaning to it that I was possibly missing. "There is," he replied pausing briefly. He cracked a wide, rare smile as he continued "unlike america, in mother russia, dentist remove teeth from plaque."

1	Tennis Elbow  One day Bill complained to his friend, "My elbow really hurts, I guess I should see a doctor." His friend said, "Don't do that. There's a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. Just put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. It only costs ten dollars." Bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. Finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. The computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. After a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: You have tennis elbow. Soak your arm in warm water. Avoid heavy lifting. It will be better in two weeks. Late that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. He decided to give it a try. He mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. To top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. He went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample, and deposited the $10. The computer made the usual noise and printed out the following message: Your tap water is too hard. Get a water softener. Your dog has worms. Get him vitamins. Your daughter is using cocaine. Put her in a rehabilitation clinic. Your wife is pregnant with twin girls. They aren't yours. Get a lawyer. And if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better

Added to it was this cryptic message, Genesis 3:10." Reaching for his Bible to check out the citation, he broke up in gales of laughter. Revelation 3:20 begins "Behold, I stand at the door and knock." Genesis 3:10 reads, "I heard your voice in the garden and I was afraid, for I was naked."

I’m not taking that chance with this woman.”

1	Bear's Religion.   A priest, a minister, and a rabbi want to see who’s best at his job. So they each go into the woods, find a bear, and attempt to convert it. Later they get together. The priest begins: “When I found the bear, I read to him from the Catechism and sprinkled him with holy water. Next week is his First Communion.”  “I found a bear by the stream,” says the minister, “and preached God’s holy word. The bear was so mesmerized that he let me baptize him.”  They both look down at the rabbi, who is lying on a gurney in a body cast. “Looking back,” he says, “maybe I shouldn’t have started with the circumcision.”

Barely believing his eyes, he turns into an old truck stop - and sure enough - there's a big neon sign that says "Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution."  He knocks and a wizened old nun opens the door.  "$50 bucks to get fucked in here," she says.  The man forks over the money and runs inside. He goes down a long hallway and comes to another door. He knocks and a moderately attractive nun answers.  "$100 to get fucked by the Sisters of Mercy, friend."  He hands over the cash, runs through the door, down another hallway, and knocks on the door at the end.  A stunningly beautiful nun opens the door and says, "$500, best fucking of your life, just through here."  The man hands over the money, runs through the door and finds himself outside. The door slams shut behind him, and above the door he sees a sign.  "You have just been fucked by the Sisters of Mercy House of Prostitution."

4	A sweet old lady is making lunch for her husband one day...  She had been making him the same lunch for the past 40 years. His favorite: a sandwich on italian bread, made with turkey, american cheese, pickles, onions, mustard, and mayo. The husband walks into the kitchen, sits down, and takes a bite. His wife asks the same thing she always asks, “Hows the sandwich dear?”     Every time he would give the same response, “It tastes fine”. He would continue eating with a disappointed look on his face.     His wife thinks maybe its time to switch things up a bit. So the next day, she makes him his normal lunch, only this time, she makes it with ham and cheese, and on wheat bread. She thought surely he will enjoy this!     The husband enters the kitchen, sits down, and takes a bite. His wife then asks “Hows the sandwich dear?”     As always, he replies “It tastes fine”. He would continue eating with a disappointed look on his face.     His wife then thinks maybe she needs to offer him more variety. So the next day, she makes him a sandwich, only this time its made with salami, pepperoni, and extra veggies and vinegarette dressing. He walks in the kitchen, takes a bite, and the wife asks “Hows the sandwich dear?”     As always, he replies “It tastes fine” and continued eating with a disappointed look on his face.     The next day, as lunch time is getting ready to roll around, his wife was making him lunch. She was furious at the lack of excitement and enjoyment coming from her husband, so she decides shes going to make him the most unique sandwich hes ever had.     She prepares her italian bread, only this time she toasts it, and almost burns it. She adds random ingredients like peanut butter, peppers and onions, strawberry jam, turkey, ham, corned beef, some olives and some various seasonings. She thought “If this doesnt get a new reaction out of him, nothing will!”     The husband walks into the kitchen, takes a seat, and takes a bite of his sandwich. All of a sudden, his eyes widen, and he takes two more bites.     Suddenly, he looks up at his wife with the biggest grin he’s ever had. He chuckled a bit and says “Finally! Something original in this sub!”
2	A chicken walks into a library... The librarian lifts their gaze with a mixture of curiosity and surprise as the bird hops onto the counter. It tilts its head and, with an air of demand, clucks:  "Book!"  The librarian is taken aback at this odd display. The chicken impatiently taps one foot on the counter.  "Book, book!"  'All right', thinks the librarian, picking up a copy of Shakespeare's Hamlet and waggling it in front of the fowl. The chicken inspects the title, nods its thanks, tucks the book under its wing, hops off the counter and promptly waddles out of the building.  The custodian snorts their incredulity and returns to their work.  Half an hour later, the automatic doors of the library glide open and again in walks the chicken. It tilts its head and, with an air of impertinence, clucks:  "Book! Book book!"  The librarian blinks, shrugs, and pulls out a copy of Miller's All My Sons. They slide it over to the bird, who inspects the title, nods its thanks, tucks the book under its wing, hops off the counter and promptly struts out of the building.  Half an hour later, the automatic doors of the library drift apart and, for a third time, in walks the chicken. It tilts its head and, with an air of thinly veiled frustration, clucks:  "Book! BOOK!"  This had now become less novel to the librarian. They heave Homer's Odyssey onto the desk and meet the eye of the feathery fiend who, like clockwork, inspects the title, nods its thanks, tucks the book under its wing, hops off the counter and promptly stomps - as best a small farm animal can - out of the building.  'Fuck it,' thinks the librarian, 'I'm going to find out what this nonsense is all about.' They lift themselves from their office chair and tiptoe - as best as a librarian can, which is rather well, in fact - after the avian nuisance.  The sneaky chase takes them out of the library; past the butchers; the ironmongers; the fishmongers; the swimming pool and eventually leads to the park.  The librarian creeps up behind a bush to observe as the chicken trots up to the pond and to the very edge of the water. It lifts its wing to drop the literature onto the grass and firmly announces:  "Book! Book, book!"  The water shifts. Out from under a stone a frog hops out, looks at the title of the book, blinks its eyes one at a time, regards the chicken with a weary gaze, and responds:  "Reddit. Reddit."

"Onions?" said the boy. "Yes, see them and they make you cry,” the father replied. This infuriated the wife and daughter so the daughter said, "Mum, how many kinds of willies are there?" The mother, surprised, smiles and looks at her daughter and answers, "Well dear, a man goes through three phases. In a man's twenties, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. In his thirties and forties, it is a birch, flexible but reliable. After his fifties, it is like a Christmas tree." "A Christmas tree?" said the daughter. "Yes, dead from the root up and the balls are merely ornamental."

1	A boy is five years old His father, wanting to part some wisdom on his son, whose name is Johnny, decides to take him out to the wilderness, and man to man, tell him the way to life.  One morning, he wakes Johnny up. "Agh, dad, it's 5 in the morning," Johnny says groggily, "can't I sleep in?" His father smiles. "Come on, son. We have a full day ahead of us."  The two set out on a far, far journey, walking through the woods, then the creek, then the hill. Finally, they reach the top of the hill, around eleven o'clock, with the sun blaring down on them, the whole town able to view. They finally sit down after all that walking.  "Now son," the father says, "I'm going to tell you some things I want you to remember. I know you're five, and you have some growing up to do, but I want you to remember these things." Johnny, not really understanding, agrees to listen. "Son," the father starts, "I want you to promise me you'll always eat healthy. Not eating healthy leads to obesity. Promise me you'll always stay in shape. Treat your body like a temple, like a palace. Always put others before yourself. Always be honest, with yourself, and with others. Don't be afraid to tell the truth, as long as it's respectful of the other person."  He clears his throat. "And finally," he says, "never take something that doesn't belong to you. You have to work for it." Johnny, not really understanding, begins to think about it. The two walk all the way back, drenched in sweat, before finally coming back home in the evening. Johnny sits up all night and thinks about what his father told him.  The next day, Johnny, who has always eaten bacon and eggs for breakfast, asks his mom for some fruit instead. While all his friends love candy and pop, Johnny never has any, only drinking water and small portions of milk and organic juice.   Johnny also starts to get into shape, signing up for all the teams. He starts a workout regimen that makes him the most buff kid in all of kindergarten. By second grade, he is a natural athlete, to the point where's he's playing against sixth graders.  Teachers begin to compliment Johnny on the way he talks to people, noting that he shows humility and thinks about others. He becomes the most popular kid in school, since he shows interest in every kid, and does his best to make everyone feel wanted.  All the things his father told him had stuck. The last one the most. Johnny found himself tempted to grift. At a friend's house, he noticed a signed David Ortiz card, and instantly decided he was going to take it. As he was about to put it under his shirt, he stopped himself. He remembered the advice, and left the card alone.  Elementary school became high school. Johnny continued to show athletic prowess, and now was captain of most of the sports teams,  put up great grades, and had a lot of friends. He was voted valedictorian by a landslide, and was offered scholarships to numerous colleges. Because he treated his body like a temple, he was in great shape, and was generally happy.  He went off to college, playing football for four years, putting up great grades, while also moving in with his high school sweetheart. He graduated summa cum laude, and eventually got married and had kids.  Years passed, and he never forgot the words his father told him. He always stayed in great shape, always put himself before others, always ate healthy, and was always honest with people. But most of all, he was never a thief. By now, Johnny was a man in his 80s. He had lived a successful life, but unfortunately his wife had passed years before, and now he as well was sick.   A few weeks later, Johnny wasn't in any better shape. Finally, he lay in his bed, unable to get up. With family and friends by his side, Johnny lay, dying. His children told him, "dad, you've lived such a great life."  Johnny was about to agree with them. But he stopped. Something felt unfulfilled.  All of the sudden, Johnny, with all the energy he had left, got up. "I want you to take me to the convenience store," he said. Everyone was surprised, and persuaded him to stay in bed. "I'll go there dad, you stay in bed," a son said. "No," Johnny said, "I'm going there myself."  "I've lived a great life. I've stayed healthy for most of my years, I've stayed in great shape, I've been honest with people, I've put others before me." Johnny gasped. "And I've never stole. And I feel like I haven't taken any risks."  Johnny began to walk to the convenience store himself. Suddenly, he collapsed with all his upper body strength he dragged himself down the sidewalk, until he got outside the convenience store. He was going to steal a candy bar, just to feel that rush that he never had. He was going to give in to that temptation, the one his father warned him about. His family found him outside, not moving, and they picked him up and brought him back home. Gasping, Johnny, unable to move, was back in bed.   He was going to die living a perfect live, but was it perfect? Was it the life he could've lived? He had already done everything, but now he was on his deathbed, unable to finally do any of the things his father told him not to. Too weak to speak to lie to anyone, too sick to eat a piece of fruit or go for a run, he thought of something to do. He thought harder, and harder. He thought with all his strength. So he stole the punchline.

3	A pro wrestler is down to fight The Mad Monk, and his manager says to him: "Whatever you do, don't let him put you in the Mad Monk Hold. That's his signature move and no-one's ever gotten out of it."  But about five minutes into the fight, sure enough, our boy's all wrapped up like a human pretzel, with one arm going one way, one leg going another way, his spine all twisted and wound up like a spring and he can't even tell which way his head's on, and he realizes he's in the Mad Monk Hold.  Then he sees a familiar bulge hanging down just in front of his face, and he's pretty desperate, so he takes a deep breath and bites down as hard as he can.  Moments later there is a wild scream and the Mad Monk is flying out of the ring, and he lands in the fourth row of seats with a godawful crash, and before he manages to pick himself up and scramble back into the ring, he's been counted out.  And our boy staggers back to his corner after the referee has held his arm up, and the manager says "What happened? How did you manage it? No-one's ever gotten out of the Mad Monk Hold!"  And the wrestler says, "well, it's amazing the strength you find when you bite your own ballsack."

She instructs him to remove his cloths and put on the hospital gown, then leaves the room.  After a few minutes of waiting, there’s a knock on the door, and the doctor walks in. They greet, then begin discussing the patients health concerns.   The doctor then says, “Before we conduct any tests, I need you to lie down on the examining table so I can check for any abnormalities.”   The patient then lies down.  After only seconds of looking over the patients body, the Doctor says, “Well, the biggest problem you face is having to stop masterbating”.  Extremely concerned, the patient asks why.   The doctor responds, “Because I’m trying to examine you”.

1	Hope it ain't a repost. Murphy showed up at Mass one Sunday and the priest almost fell down when he saw him. Murphy had never been seen in church in his life. After Mass, the priest caught up with Murphy and said, "Murphy, I am so glad ya decided to come to Mass, what made ya come?" Murphy said, "I got to be honest with you Father, a while back, I misplaced me hat and I really, really love that hat. I know that McGlynn had a hat just like me hat, and I knew that McGlynn came to church every Sunday. I also knew that McGlynn had to take off his hat during Mass and figured he would leave it in the back of church. So, I was going to leave after Communion and steal McGlynn's hat." The priest said, "Well, Murphy, I notice that ya didn't steal McGlynn's hat. What changed your mind?" Murphy said, "Well, after I heard your sermon on the 10 Commandments, I decided that I didn't need to steal McGlynn's hat after all." The priest g ave Murphy a big smile and said; "After I talked about 'Thou Shalt Not Steal' ya decided you would rather do without your hat than burn in Hell, right ?" Murphy slowly shook his head and said, "No, Father, after ya talked about 'Thou Shalt Not Commit Adultery' I remembered where I left me hat."

1	A time traveler comes back from the year 2045 I encountered a time traveler today.  During my self isolation he came to the door dressed in a hazmat suit.  I was of course alarmed when I opened the door to such a site.  He quickly explained who he was and asked if he could have just a few minutes of my time.  I didn't believe anything he was saying but I figured the risk of transmission was low due to his protective gear and frankly, I was ready for some human interaction, even from a potential crazy person, so I let him in.  He sat down and said he wanted to tell me some things about the future because if this knowledge was entrusted to me, I could be trusted to use it for good.  Over the next few minutes he told me about many things but I was left with many questions.  He said I could ask a few, so I did.  I asked about climate change.  He assured me that after 2035, nations got serious and the problem has been all but solved.  I asked about Covid-19.  He assured me it would be a blip on the radar of human history and nobody worries about pandemics anymore.  I asked about massive economic turmoil we are in.  He said despite the borrowing and deficits of earlier times, those debts are now repaid. The United States has never been a better more united society.  Everyone has free healthcare.  I was so happy to hear all this.  I asked about inflation and how much it costs for a gallon of water, or a loaf of bread or a cup of coffee.  He chuckled and said I didn't need to worry about such trivial things.  In the year 2045, it was possible to still get coffee at Starbucks in America for under 150 Yuan.

She went to the front door of the first house, and asked the owner if he had any odd jobs for her to do.  "Well, I guess I could use somebody to paint my porch," he said, "How much will you charge me?"  Delighted, the girl quickly responded, "How about $50?"  The man agreed and told her that the paint brushes and everything she would need was in the garage.  The man's wife, hearing the conversation said to her husband, "Does she realize that our porch goes ALL the way around the house?"  He responded, "That's a bit cynical, isn't it?"  The wife replied, "You're right. I guess I'm starting to believe all those dumb blonde jokes we've been getting by email lately."  Later that day, the blonde teenager came to the door to collect her money. "You're finished already?" the startled husband asked.  "Yes, she replied, and I even had paint left over, so I gave it two coats."   Impressed, the man reached into his pocket for the $50.00 and handed it to her along with a $10.00 tip.  “And, by the way," the teenager added, "it's not a Porch, it's a Lexus."

5	A guy is constantly suffering from terrible headaches... A guy is constantly suffering from terrible headaches. He goes to a bunch of doctors, runs any test imaginable, and no one can figure out why. One day a doctor tells him- “I think we figured out a solution, but you’re not going to like it. If we cut off your balls, the constant headache will stop”. The guy was shocked, but he didn’t want to continue the torture, so he agreed.  After the procedure, the pain suddenly went away. He was relieved that the headache was finally gone, but still felt terrible, because he didn’t feel like a man anymore.  In order to cheer himself up, he went to an expensive store to get himself a tailored suit. The tailor, who spent 50 years working there was a real pro and said that he doesn’t need to take measurements, he can just correctly guess every size.  At first the guy didn’t believe but the tailor gave him a pair of pants that fit just perfectly. Then the tailor gave him a dress shirt, that fit exactly right, without any measurements. Then the tailor gave him a jacket, that also fit perfectly, the guy was amazed.  The tailor said : “Let’s also get you some silk underwear, it is very nice. From looking at you , I can tell you wear large. ” The guy suddenly says: “Nope! You’re finally wrong. I wear small, looks like even you aren’t perfect” The tailor: “Sir, I’ve been a tailor for 50 years, your underwear size is definitely large. If you were wearing small, it would squeeze your balls so tight that you would suffer from constant headaches”   Edit: spelling

Eager to strike up a conversation, he blurted out, "Business trip or pleasure?"  She turned, smiled and said, "Business. I'm going to the Annual Nymphomaniacs of America Convention in Boston."   He swallowed hard.   Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen sitting next to him, and she was going to a meeting of nymphomaniacs.   Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, "What's your business role at this convention?"   "Lecturer," she responded. "I use information that I have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about it."   "Really?"  he said.   "And what kind of myths are there?"   "Well, she explained, "One popular myth is that African-American men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the Native American Indian who is most likely to possess that trait."   "Another popular myth is that Frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of Jewish descent who are the best."   She went on, "I have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the Southern Redneck."   Suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed.  "I'm sorry," she said, "I shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. I don't even know your name..."   "Tonto," the man said,   "Tonto Goldstein, but my friends call me Bubba."

One day, he fell in love with a beautiful lady.  He refrained from speaking for two whole years so he could call her “my darling.” But then he wanted to tell her he loved her, so he waited three more years.  At the end of these five years, he wanted to ask her to marry him, so he waited another four years.   Finally, as the ninth year of silence ended, he led the lady to the most romantic place in the kingdom and said, “My darling, I love you! Will you marry me?”   And the lady said, “Pardon?”

1	An old preacher was dying. He sent a message for his banker and his lawyer, both church members, to come to his home.   When  they arrived, they were ushered up to his bedroom. As they entered the room, the preacher held out his hands and motioned for them to sit on each side of the bed. The preacher grasped their hands, sighed contentedly, smiled, and stared at the ceiling. For a time, no one said anything.   Both the banker and lawyer were honored that the preacher would ask them to be with him during his final moments. They were also puzzled; the preacher had never given them any indication that he particularly liked either of them. They both remembered his many long, uncomfortable sermons about greed, covetousness, and avaricious behavior that made them squirm in their seats.   Finally, the banker said, "Preacher, why did you ask us to come?"   The old preacher mustered up his strength and then said weakly, "Jesus died between two thieves, and that's how I want to go."

1	The Atheist and the bear.  One beautiful morning, an atheist was walking through the forest, admiring nature's surroundings...   He looked up and saw the trees swaying in the wind high above him and smiled...   He saw the river glisten and the sun twinkle like a new born star and it made him warm inside...   He thought to himself that mother nature had made a true and wonderful world...     The atheist had walked a little further down the track he had taken when suddenly a bear jumped out of the bushes only a few yards ahead of him and started growling, looking hungry and ran quickly towards him...     Seeing the big bear bounding towards him he screamed in horror and started running as fast as he could away from the bear...     Knowing that the bear would catch up to him and he had no chance, the atheist soon ran out of breath and in a few paces fell to the ground...     As the bears shadow fell upon his face and his paws come down upon his chest, the atheist screamed, "Oh help me God!"     Suddenly the trees that he so much admired stopped swaying...     The river he loved suddenly stopped flowing...     And the sky opened up and a voice begun to speak...     "I am God, and even though you don’t believe in me, I am here for every being on this earth."     The atheist felt relieved a little bit and asked God, "I’m sort of in this situation, I’m only asking if you can help me get out of it."     God thought for a moment and said...     "I will give you one wish to help you and that is all, you may proceed with this wish."     The atheist thought about this wish for a moment and then spoke to God...     "Well I don’t really want to become a religious person, so I wish the bear to become religious himself."     God spoke...     "So be it done."     Suddenly the sky closed up...     The river turned back into its flowing glory...     The trees began to sway again...     And the bear clapped his paws together and said...     "Thank you God for this meal I’m about to receive!"

Next week is his First Communion.”  “I found a bear by the stream,” says the minister, “and preached God’s holy word. The bear was so mesmerized that he let me baptize him.”  They both look down at the rabbi, who is lying on a gurney in a body cast. “Looking back,” he says, “maybe I shouldn’t have started with the circumcision.

The old man then says, “Tell you what, I’ll give you a chance to win your money back and more! I bet you $7,500 that I can’t bite my other eye.” The man thought, I haven’t seen him with a dog or a blind stick. “Ok, you’re on!” The old man takes out his false teeth and bites his other eye.

2	An American soldier, serving in World War II, had just returned from several weeks of intense action on the German front lines. He had finally been granted R&R and was on a train bound for London. The train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. The only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.  The war weary soldier asked, "Please, ma'am, may I sit in that seat?" The English woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, "You Americans. You are such a rude class of people. Can't you see my Little Fifi is using that seat?" The soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.  Again he asked, "Please, lady. May I sit there? I'm very tired." The English woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, "You Americans! Not only are you rude, you are also arrogant."  The soldier didn"t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.  The woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.  An English gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, "You know, sir, you Americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. You eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. You drive your automobiles on the wrong side of the road. And now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window."

"Why, pray tell," the man asked the drunk, "are you looking for your watch here if you lost it a half a block up the street?" The drunk replied, "The light is a lot better here."

1	Avian Flu scare in Massachusetts Breaking news... Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Bird Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts. However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car. MTA then hired an Ornithological Behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger. They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout "Cah!!", not a single one could shout "Truck"!

2	Marine returns from duty in Iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in Afghanistan. That evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.  As he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.  The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.  As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.  Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...  "These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan." He says, "Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home."  The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.  After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.  "Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here?" Asks the replacement. "And what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?"  "Well, I'll be honest with you", replies the marine, "this a shit post, and what you're looking at here is a criminal punch line."

However, the casket crashes through his door, with the lid of the casket clapping.   clappity-BUMP...clappity-BUMP... clappity-BUMP...  on his heels, as the terrified man runs.   Rushing upstairs to the bathroom, he locks himself in. His heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.   With a loud CRASH the casket breaks down the door.

"No." "Can you at least add or subtract?" "Well no I can't do that either," the man says. "But I'm desperate for a job! I haven't a penny to my name and I'm starving!" "Well, alright here's a quarter to buy yourself something to eat," the manager gives him.

Since he was an Indian Chief in a modern society, he had never been taught the old secrets.  When he looked at the sky, he couldn't tell what the weather was going to be. Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect firewood to be prepared.  Also, being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea. He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked, "Is the coming winter going to be cold?"  "It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed," the meteorologist at the weather service responded. So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more wood in order to be prepared.  A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. "Is it going to be a very cold winter?"  "Yes," the man at National Weather Service again replied, "it's definitely going to be a very cold winter." The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of wood they could find.  Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. "Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?"  "Absolutely," the man replied. "It's going to be one of the coldest winters ever."  "How can you be so sure?" the Chief asked.  The weatherman replied, "The Indians are collecting wood like crazy."

"Patrick Henry, 1775."  "Very good!" apprised the teacher. "Now, who said, "Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth?"  Again, no response except from Jose :"Abraham Lincoln, 1863."  The teacher snapped at the class, "Class, you should be ashamed! Jose, who is new to our country, knows more about its history than you do!"  She heard a loud whisper: "Screw the Mexicans!"  "Who said that? " she demanded.  Jose put his hand up. "Jim Bowie, 1836.  At that point, a student in the back said, "I'm gonna puke."  The teacher glared and asked, "All right! Now, who said that?"  Again, Jose answered, "George Bush to the Japanese Prime Minister, 1991."  Now furious, another student yelled, "Oh yeah? Suck this!"  Jose jumped out of his chair waving his hand and shouting to the teacher, "Bill Clinton to Monica Lewinsky, 1997!"  The teacher fainted, and as the class gathered around her on the floor, someone said, "Oh shit, we're in BIG trouble now!"  Jose whispered, "Saddam Hussein, 2003."  Finally someone throws an eraser at Jose, someone shouted "Duck"!  Teacher, just waking, asked "Who said that?  Jose: "Dick Cheney, 2006 "

Later that night, unbeknownst to them, the father walks into the woods to commit suicide but he meets an Angel instead.  The Angel asks, "why are you crying, old man?". The man responds, **"I'm a very poor farmer with 3 sons and my only cow just died and I have no money to take care of them, that's why I'm here to commit suicide."**   The Angel goes, **"Ok. I'll bring your cow back to life but only if one of you fucks me till I'm satisfied."** The man can't believe what's happening but accepts the Angel's offer anyway and goes back to get his sons.   After returning with his sons, he goes first but just 5 minutes in, he ends up cumming. No reaction from the Angel. Now, A takes his place and goes to work. He too does not get that far and cums within 20 minutes. The Angel is not impressed.   B is very nervous but surprisingly ends up lasting almost 45 minutes but that's still not enough to satisfy the Angel.   It's all up to C now. He starts hard. The others are cheering him up. Half and hour as passed and he's still going hard with no signs of stopping. The Angel is loving it. This keeps on for several hours until the Angel finally tells him to stop. The Angel is satisfied and brings the cow back to life and then disappears.   C doesn't look tired at all. His Dad, A, and B are very much surprised by C's performance.   The Dad goes, **"Wow, C. The 3 of us couldn't even last an hour and you went that hard for so long. That's crazy."**   C then replies, **"Yeah I'm surprised, too. She took it way better than the cow."**

2	Two prawns named Christian and Jason are swimming together on a reef Being near the bottom of the food chain, both are in danger of being eaten and are constantly scared of any larger fish. Christian loves his life despite the odds, but Jason is unhappy. He wishes to no longer be scared. "Wouldn't it be great if we were the top of the food chain?" Jason says, "imagine, no more swimming for your life, no more hiding ever minute, just freedom!" Christian agrees, but he's a little more hesitant of the idea. Unlike Jason, Christian's heart is not set on freedom, but on building a family and relationships, like the one he has with Jason.   One day, both prawns encounter a magical cod! The cod declares "I can grant you whatever wish you want!" Christian, despite the circumstances, is quite happy with his life and wouldn't change anything for the world. Jason, on the other hand, quickly asks "please magical cod, turn me into a great white shark!" The cod grants his wish and Jason suddenly grows into an enormous apex predator. He's elated, shouting "I am free, I can do whatever I want, I am no longer scared! How good is this Christian!" Christian is happy for Jason but a bit hesitant too. "Jason, I'm happy for you but honestly I don't think this works for our friendship. You're a predator, I'm prey. You're big, I'm small. I'm glad you got what you want but I'm still a prawn and you are quite intimidating." Despite Jason's best efforts, he can't convince Christian that he won't eat him, and they go on their separate ways with the mutual understanding they've found their true calling.   Years go by and Jason is having the time of his life. He eats whatever he wants. He goes wherever he wants. The only thing he doesn't have is his friendship with Christian. Slowly, this starts to impact Jason more and more. He is free but he is lonely. He misses his old life. After a long and arduous search, Jason finds the magical cod again once more white close to where their first encounter was. Jason pleads with the cod to change him back into a prawn. He's realised now that his friendship with Christian outweighs his love as an apex predator. The cod indulges Jason and turns him back into a prawn.  Jason swims hurriedly to find his old friend Christian. Eventually he finds him, living grin the same latch of reef they used to peruse together. "Christian!" Jason shouts, "I'm back!" Christian is obviously a bit suspicious and yells back "Jason is that you? I thought you were a great white shark?" Jason replies "It's ok, I've found cod, I'm a prawn again Christian!"

1	Dark joke A guy sits at a bar in a skyscraper restaurant high above the city. He slams a shot of tequila, goes over to the window and jumps out.  The guy sitting next to him can’t believe what he just saw. He’s more surprised when, 10 minutes later, the same guy walks back into the bar and sits down next to him.  The astonished onlooker asks, “How did you do that? I just saw you jump out the window, and we’re hundreds of feet above the ground!”  The jumper responds by slurring, “Well, I don’t get it either. I slam a shot of tequila, and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.” He takes a shot, goes to the window and jumps out.  The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls to just above the sidewalk, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.  The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window. As he reaches the bottom, he doesn’t slow down at all. SPLAT!  The first guy orders another shot of tequila. The bartender shakes his head. “You’re really an a**hole when you’re drunk, Superman.”

The next morning, the boys get up and arrive at the breakfast table. She asks the first boy what he wants for breakfast.  "Give me some goddamn cornflakes," he answers.  She takes him over her knee and spanks him vigorously. Then she turns to the second son and asks what he'd like.  "I want some cocksucking cornflakes."  The mom, angrier still, grabs the boy, puts him over her knee, and tans his hide.  "Now," she says, turning to the third boy, "what do you want for breakfast?"  He looks at his two brothers, sitting on the floor crying, then says, "Well I sure as shit don't want no fucking cornflakes."

3	One day a man and woman were in their bedroom making love All of a sudden a bumble bee entered the bedroom window. As the lady parted her legs, the bee entered her vagina. The woman started screaming, "Oh my god, help me, there's a bee in my vagina!"   The husband immediately took her to the local doctor and explained the situation. The doctor thought for a moment and said "Hmm, tricky situation. But I have a solution to the problem if young sir would permit." The husband being very concerned agreed that the doctor could use whatever method to get the bee out of his wife's vagina.   The doctor said "Okay, what I'm going to do is rub some honey over the tip of my penis and insert it into your wife's vagina. When I feel the bee getting closer to the tip of my penis, I shall withdraw it and the bee should hopefully follow my penis out of your wife's vagina. The husband nodded and gave his approval. The lady said, "Yes, whatever, just get on with it."   So the doctor, after covering the tip of his penis with honey, entered the woman. After a few gentle strokes, the doctor said, "I don't think the bee has noticed the honey yet. Perhaps I should try further." The lady began to quiver with excitement, moaning aloud. The doctor, concentrating very hard, looked like he was enjoying himself. The husband became very annoyed and shouted, "Now wait a minute! What the hell do you think you're doing?" The doctor, still concentrating, replied, "Change of plan. I'm gonna drown the bastard!"

The next day as Owl is taking a stroll, he notices that one of the windows is smashed.  He calls an urgent meeting where all the animals gather together.  \\- I am sorry for this bothersome affair - the Owl says - but I'm afraid the public restroom's window has been smashed by an unknown individual! Anyone, who's responsible for or witnessed this act, please step forward.  Amid silence the Rabbit stands up, and apologises.  \\- Well, it just happened to be, that Bear was in the stall next to me, and he ran out of toilet paper. So instead he grabbed me, wiped his ass with my fur and threw me out the window.  Because Bear wasn't in the meeting, and he was the biggest baddest animal around, no one bothered to scold him, and the mayor just asked Rabbit to be more careful next time. Immadiately some volunteers stepped forward to fix the window, and by afternoon it was good as new.  On the second day, the mayor goes for his daily stroll, and sees the window smashed again. He calls another meeting and asks the cuprit to step forward.

The window was fixed again, and that was the end of it.  On the third day, the mayor sees that the window is not smashed this time, instead a whole section of the wall fell down. He calls the meeting, asks if anyone knows about anything. The Hedgehog stood up.  \\- Well it just happened to be, that Bear was in the stall next to me...

1	[Nsfw] [long] An aging father has decided to go into assisted living Because he didn't want to burden his son. He had been having trouble around the house and had a few scary falls. His son begged him to stay at his family's house, because he felt that this was the best plan. "Dad, please! Stay with us! I've heard those places are horrible!" His father says "No way, son. You have your family to care for and I won't be a bother. I would rather find a nice place and have a new adventure!"  After a bit of back and forth, his son acquiesced and offered to take him around to make sure that his old man found a nice place to live out his days. They went to 7 different facilities over the next few weeks before settling on the perfect place. The orderlies were kind and caring, the staff seemed content, the residents seemed happy.  "This is the one, son. I can feel it!" the father said. "Are you sure, pop? The wife and I are happy to have you! Don't you want to sleep on it?" His father's mind was made up, and despite his age, his resolve was rather strong. He decided to sign paperwork and move in that very day. That night, his son was anxious and worried and barely slept a wink. The following morning, he got a call from his father.  "SON! YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BELIEVE THIS!!!"  His son is perplexed... "The dinner was the best I've had since your mother passed 12 years ago! Everyone here is so friendly and kind! The bed was so comfortable that I slept the whole night and that hasn't happened in years!" His son was overjoyed! "This is great, pop! I'm so glad you're happy! I guess I can stop worrying about you now!" His father was so happy, he hadn't heard him with such vim and vigor in years. "Son, I haven't told you the best part yet! I slept so well and was so content that I woke up with an erection so firm that I thought I was in my twenties!" "TMI, pop..." "Seriously son!" he continued, "the most amazingly beautiful orderly with the most fantastic rack I think I've ever seen woke me up for a sponge bath, saw my erection and gave me the best blowjob I think I've ever had!!!!" "Holy shit, pop! This place sounds amazing!" his son retorted. "I told you this place was for me," he said.  He rushed his son off the phone after sharing his wonderful news because he couldn't wait to see how the first full day would go. His son was finally able to relax, knowing his dad was in a good place. His phone rang a few hours later and he saw it was his dad, and couldn't wait to hear the next happy update. "SON, YOU HAVE TO GET ME THE FUCK OUT OF HERE!!!!!" The son was perplexed! "What happened? You had such a beautiful night and morning! You even got a hummer from that orderly!?!?!" His dad said "well I was walking down the hallway, thinking about my wonderful morning. I tripped over my own feet and fell! I saw this big, strong orderly coming to help and I tried to wave him off. You know how I hate to be a bother, but he came over anyway. When I tried to get up, he ripped my pants down and fucked me up the ass!" His son thought for a minute, and finally responded. "Pop, if you taught me anything, you taught me that you have to take the good with the bad. You got a blowjob this morning!" His dad was incredulous. "You don't understand son, I wake up with an erection once every 3 or 4 months, but I fall down 5 or 6 times a day!"

1	At the beginning of COVID 19, there was a man. He was told to wash his hands for 20 seconds at a time. He chose not to and said God would protect him and the believers.  He was told he should be wearing a mask to protect others. He chose not to and said God would protect him and the believers.  He was told he should socially distance. He went to church anyway and said God would protect him and the believers.  The grocery store gave him guidelines as to which direction he should be walking down aisles. He didn’t follow them and said God would protect him and the believers. His mom died two weeks later from complications due to COVID 19.  As he started to have a sore throat and a fever, he mourned.  He died a week later.  As he arrived at the Pearly Gates, he was met by God. He asked, “God, why did you take my Mom away and end my life so early? I was a believer and so was she.” God said, “I sent Angels to you that told you to wash your fucking hands, wear a fucking mask, don’t gather in large fucking groups and follow the fucking directions of those who were trying to keep you safe. You chose not to fucking listen!”
2	Nuns at the pearly gates (not my joke, but it still makes me chuckle) A bus full of Nuns falls of a cliff and they all die. They arrive at the gates of heaven and meet St. Peter. St. Peter says to them “Sisters, welcome to Heaven. In a moment I will let you all though the pearly gates, but before I may do that, I must ask each of you a single question. ”  St. Peter turns to the first Nun in the line and asks her “Sister, have you ever touched a penis?” The Sister Responds “Well… there was this one time… that I kinda sorta… touched one with the tip of my pinky finger…” St. Peter says “Alright Sister, now dip the tip of your pinky finger in the Holy Water, and you may be admitted.” and she did so. St. Peter now turns to the second nun and says “Sister, have you ever touched a penis?” “Well…. There was this one time… that I held one for a moment…” “Alright Sister, now just wash your hands in the Holy Water, and you may be admitted” and she does so. Now at this, there is a noise, a jostling in the line. It seems that one nun is trying to cut in front of another! St. Peter sees this and asks the Nun “Sister Susan, what is this? There is no rush!” Sister Susan responds “Well if I’m going to have to gargle this stuff, I’d rather do it before Sister Mary sticks her ass in it!”

Feeling the heat from the police force, they decide to use a deaf and dumb person for this job. If he were to get caught, he wouldn't be able to communicate to the police what he was doing.  In his first week, the collector picks up over $40,000. He gets greedy, decides to keep the money, and stashes it in a safe place. The Mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods after the deaf and dumb collector.  The hoods find the collector and ask him where the money is. The deaf and dumb collector can't communicate with them, so the Mafia drags the guy to an interpreter.  The Mafia hood says to the interpreter, "Ask him where da money is."  The interpreter signs, "Where's the money?"  The dumb man signs back, "I don't know what you're talking about."  The interpreter tells the hood, "He says he doesn't know what you're talking about."  The hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the dumb collector. "Now ask him where the money is!"  The interpreter signs, "Where is the money?  The deaf man signs back, "The $40,000 is in a tree stump in Central Park."  The interpreter says to the hood, "He says he still doesn't know what you're talking about and doesn't think you have the balls to pull the trigger."

3	There was a businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. He knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone... because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else.  So he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. He thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. He was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. He explained his situation, the old man.  "Well, I don't really know of anything that will do the trick. We have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but I don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except ?" said the old man, and then he stopped.  "Except what?" asked the businessman.  "Nothing, nothing," said the old man.  "C'mon, tell me! I need something!" protested the businessman.  "Well, sir, I don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick,'" the old man said.  "So what's up with this voodoo dick?" the businessman asked.  The old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. He opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. The businessman laughed, and said, "Big fucking deal. It looks like every other dildo in this shop!"  The old man said, "But you haven't seen what it'll do yet."  He pointed to a door and said "Voodoo dick, the door."  The voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. The whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. Before the door could split, the old man said, "Voodoo dick, get back in your box!"  The voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, quiescent once more.  The businessman said, "I'll take it!"  The old man resisted and said it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash. The guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, "Voodoo dick, my pussy."  He left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.  After he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. She thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick. She got it out, and said "Voodoo dick, my pussy!" The voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. It was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before.  After three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. She tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. Her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off. So she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. She put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. On the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. He asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. Gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.  The officer looked at her for a second, and then said, "Yea, right. Voodoo dick, my ass!"

Is that true, Mom?" The Mom replies: "No, Honey, it's because you're twenty-three"

1	Headaches and testicles Joe had suffered from really bad headaches for the last 20 years.  He eventually decides to go and see a Doctor.   The Doctor says, 'Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches.  The bad news is that it will require removing your testicles.  You have a very rare condition, which causes your testicles to press on your spine and the pressure creates one hell of a headache.      The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.'   Joe is shocked and depressed. He wondered if he had anything to live for.   He had no choice but to go under the knife. The surgery cost him US$ 75,000.  When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, but he felt like he was missing an important part of himself.     As he walked down the street, he realized that he felt like a different person. He could make a new beginning and live a new life.   He saw a Men's clothing store and thought, 'That's what I need... A new Suit.'   He entered the shop and told the salesman, 'I'd like a new Suit.'   The elderly Tailor eyed him briefly and said, 'Let's see... size 44 would fit fine.  Joe laughed, 'That's right, how did you know?'   'Been in the business 60 years sir!' the tailor said.   Joe tried on the suit it fitted perfectly.   As Joe admired himself in the mirror, the salesman asked, 'How about a new shirt?'   Joe thought for a moment and then said, 'Sure.'   The salesman eyed Joe and said, 'Let's see, 34 sleeves and 16-1/2 neck.'   Joe was surprised, 'That's right, how did you know?'   'Been in the business 60 years sir.'   Joe tried  the shirt and it fitted perfectly.   Joe walked comfortably around the shop and the salesman asked, 'How about some new Underwear?'   Joe thought for a moment and said, 'Sure..'   The salesman said, 'Let's see..... size 36.   Joe laughed, 'Ah ha! You got it wrong this time! I've worn size 34 since I was 18 years old..'   The salesman shook his head, 'You can't wear a size 34 sir. A size 34 would press your Testicles up against the base of your spine and give you hell of a Headache.'

1	Fancy Chicago lawyer goes duck hunting in LA (Lower Alabama) (very long) This lawyer had  heard about the exceptional duck hunting in lower Alabama so he made plans to go one year. He left his hotel early and found a good spot by sun-up. He had the most expensive equipment money could buy.  He missed a few ducks, but then shot one. It flapped a couple times and landed across a fence in a field. He started to cross the fence to get it when a farmer pulled up on his tractor.  "Whoa there, buddy. You can't come onto my land."  The lawyer said, "Of course I can. That duck belongs to me and I have every right to retrieve it."  Farmer Brown said, "Nope, it's on my property, that makes it *mine*."  The lawyer immediately got pissed and told him, "I'll have you know that I'm one of the best lawyers, not only in Chicago, but in the entire state of Illinois. If you do not allow me to get my property I'll sue you and end up owning everything you have to your name!"  The farmer said, "Slow down, buddy, it's just a duck. We usually settle petty arguments like this around here with the 'three kick rule,' if you wanna try that."  Lawyer said, "What's the three kick rule?"  Farmer said, "That's where we take turns kicking each other three times, then the other person gets three kicks. The one who gives up first loses."  The lawyer looked at farmer Brown. He thought to himself, "I go to the gym three times a week, I jog nearly every day, I keep in shape. There's no way this fat old Alabama bastard can beat me at anything physical."  The lawyer said, "That sounds fine to me, I'll do it."  Farmer said, "Ok. Since it's on my property, I get to kick first."  The lawyer braced himself.  That farmer reared back his size 12 steel-toed work boot and planted it directly in that lawyer's nuts, giving his family jewels a shock he'd never thought possible. The lawyer dropped to his knees in immediate agony.  The farmer's second kick went right to the lawyer's stomach, and everything inside him came up in a surging stream of regurgitation.  Then the farmer strolled around behind him and kicked him in his ass so hard the lawyer fell face-first into the puddle of his own vomitus, spittle and tears.  That lawyer lay, gasping for breath, for several minutes before he could move. He shakily managed to get to his feet. He wiped the slobber off his face with his sleeve and glared at that farmer until he finally struggled to speak, almost in a whisper:  "Now it's *my* turn."  The farmer looked him in the eye and smiled as he got on his tractor. "Nah, I give up. You can have the duck."

1	There's this bartender . . . It's the wild west and a bartender is behind the bar, polishing glasses and going about his normal day's work. Suddenly,  a man bust through the saloon doors and yells, "y'all gotta get out of here! Big Bad Barts comin!"  Half of the patrons rush out the front, while the other half runs to the back room and hides. The bartender eases out of the saloon doors and looks off into the distance. Through the heat rays, he sees a big dust cloud. In the middle of the cloud, he can just make out a figure. The figure looks to be riding an animal, but the bartender can't determine what it is. As the figure draws near, the bartender sees that it is the biggest, meanest, most grizzled looking man he has ever seen. And the man is riding a lion.  This spooks the bartender and he runs behind the bar to hide. Moments later, the man boldly rides the lion through the swinging doors and into the bar. He dismounts and kicks the lion into the corner. "Lay down," he commands in a gravely voice. He walks over, glares over the bar and spies the bartender. "Give me a drink," he demands. The bartender shakily gets to his feet and pours the man a shot. The man throws the shot into his mouth, glass and all. Chewing on the glass, the man leans on the bar to rest.  The bartender nervously asks, "you want another?"  To which the man replies, "hell no. ain't you heard? Big Bad Barts comin."

2	Kenny the rooster. A couple saw an Ad for a rooster named Kenny in the paper for 100.00 and got curious.  They called the seller and asked why he was so expensive.  He said the rooster will fertilize everything he can get ahold of, and was a sure thing.  He even talks occasionally.  They went to see him.  When they arrived the farmer let the rooster out of the cage and he made a beadline to the hen house.  After he was done with all of the hens he ran straight for the pig pen, then the horses.  He sexed everything on the farm before the farmer put him back up.   The couple figured he would be a good buy not only for the hens but as a conversation piece.  They hadn't heard him talk but thought nothing of it.  After they brought him home they let him out of his cage and he done the same thing as before.  The couple didn't stay around to watch and just went in the house for dinner and bed.  The next day they woke up and went to check on Kenny to find him laying stone cold dead in the middle of the yard with buzzards circling above.  The guy was distraught but grabbed a bag and walked over to Kenny. The man mumbled to himself "Such a shame, he must have humped himself to death".  Kenny looked up with one eye open and said "Shh, they're getting closer"
2	From a 30 year old memory of a joke someone's grandfather told. Brad's first year away at university was a lot of partying and paying for his friend's. He quickly runs out of money. His father would not be pleased with his wastefulness, so Brad sends him a message stating he has a professor that can teach his father's dog how to read and write for a bargain price. The father can't believe the advances the school has made, but also can't pass up the opportunity. Brad soon receives his dog and the money, but promptly burns through it again. This time his father is sent another message that another professor of Brad's can teach the dog to talk to people for more money. Brad again receives the money. Soon the father is bragging to everyone in town about how when Brad comes home with the dog, the dog can not only read and write, but can also converse with everyone. Word spreads and at the end of the school year a huge throng of people are waiting to see the dog arrive at the train station. However, neither Brad nor the dog are to be seen. The father looks off at the caboose and sees a slumped shouldered Brad slowly get off the train. The father runs to greet his son and asks where the dog is. Between whimpers Brad tells him that, while they were riding the train back home, the dog put down the newspaper he was reading and said, "Brad, I'm so glad I can speak. Because now I want to tell your mother what I saw your father and the housekeeper doing when she wasn't around." Brad told his father, "I got so angry...I grabbed that dog by the neck and threw it off the train. We must have been going 100. There's no way it could have survived." Brad's father grasped him by the shoulders and looked directly into his eyes before saying, "Son, are you sure that lying dog is dead?"

1	A coach for the Detroit Lions was looking for the perfect quarterback ...he had scouted all the colleges and even the Canadian and European Leagues, but he couldn’t find a quarterback who could ensure a Super Bowl win.  Then one night while watching CNN he saw a war-zone scene in Syria. In one corner of the background, he spotted a young Syrian Muslim soldier with a truly incredible arm. He threw a hand-grenade straight into a 15th story window 100 yards away. KABOOM! He threw another hand-grenade 75 yards away, right into a chimney. KA-BLOOEY! Then he threw another at a passing car going 90 mph. BULLS-EYE!  “I’ve got to get this guy!” The coach said to himself. “He has the perfect arm!”  So, he brings him to the States and teaches him the great game of football. And the Lions go on to win the Super Bowl. The young Syrian is hailed as the great hero of football, and when the coach asks him what he wants, all the young man wants is to call his mother.  “Mom,” he says into the phone, “I just won the Super Bowl!”  “I don’t want to talk to you,” the old Muslim woman says. “You deserted us. You are not my son!”  “I don’t think you understand, Mother,” the young man pleads. “I’ve won the greatest sporting event in the world. I’m here among thousands of my adoring fans.”  “No! Let me tell you!” his mother retorts. “At this very moment, there are gunshots all around us. The neighborhood is a pile of rubble. Your two brothers were beaten within an inch of their lives last week, and I have to keep your sister in the house so she doesn’t get raped!”  The old lady pauses, and then tearfully says, “I will never forgive you for making us move to Detroit!

1	Seven dwarfs and the midget nun The seven dwarfs were in a Catholic church. They were sitting near the rear and as the priest was speaking, they whispered and giggled amongst themselves, causing quite a disturbance. All of a sudden, Dopey stands up and says, "Father, are there any midget nuns in the church ?" "No," said the priest, "There are no midget nuns in the church." A little time passed and the dwarfs were again whispering and giggling amongst themselves causing quite a disturbance and noticeably angering the priest. Soon, Dopey stands up again and asks, "Father, are there any midget nuns in the city?" "No, my son, there are no midget nuns in the city or in the church." says the priest. Again the dwarfs resume their annoying giggling to the dismay of the priest. Once again, Dopey stands up and asks "Father, are there any midget nuns in the state?" "No, my son, there are no midget nuns in the state, in the city, and no midget nuns in the church." exclaimed the priest, obviously upset. The dwarfs continue their interference. Dopey stands up and asks, "Father, are there any midget nuns in the country?" The priest, totally angered, exclaims "No, my son, there are no midget nuns in the church, in the city, in the state, no midget nuns in the country, there are no midget nuns in the whole world!!! Now sit down!!!!!" Soon afterwards, a chant can be heard from the rear of the church, "Dopey fucked a penguin. Dopey fucked a penguin. Dopey fucked a penguin."

2	Sometimes you just have to accept the facts of a situation..... Back in the 20s when most kitchens didn't have refrigerators but ice boxes instead, a man is driving a horse drawn wagon selling blocks of ice around town.  Rolling thru the streets he'd call out  "Ice! Ice for sale! Ice!"  A lady on the 5th floor of one building he's passing yells down, "I'll take some ice. Bring me a  $.10 block of ice."  So the iceman cuts off a $.12 block. It's a hot day, no elevator in the building by the time he makes it to her apartment, it'll be $.10.  While he's gone he leaves his cart & horse parked up along side the street curb and just as a stranger comes walking down the sidewalk & is beside the horse, the horse turns his head and says, "What a life!".  The man looks around and sees not another soul anywhere close to him except the horse. So the man looks at the horse and says, "Did you just say something to me?"  The horse turns his head and replies, "Oh yes I did & I'll tell you why. Every day Monday thru Fri my owner has me pull this ice wagon all over town 6am till dark. Then on Saturday's he sells rides to the kids. And on Sundays he hitches me up to a carriage and it's sun up to sun down carrying people all around the park. So I've got a dang good reason to complain about my life."  Flabbergasted the man askes the horse, "But, but, but does he realize you can TALK????"  "No, and don't you tell him either! He'll make me yell, 'Ice'! "

But in order to be able to enter heaven, you have to be cleansed of your sins first."  Then the angel summoned a huge bowl with some kind of holy, luminous water in it and called the first nun.  "Have you got any sins to be cleansed, sister?"  "Yes. I once touched a man's genital with this finger."  "Then put that finger inside the water, and you are cleansed."  She dipped her finger inside the bowl and then gates of heaven opened. She proceeded inside. The second nun was called,  "Have you got any sins to be cleansed, sister?"  "Yes, I once grabbed a man's genital with this hand."  "Then put your hand inside the water, and you are cleansed."  As she was doing what she was told to do, two remaining nuns whispered among each other and switched places. The angel noticed this and responded furiously:  "Hey! What is going on there?".  The fourth nun answered:  "Sir, we decided it would be better for me to wash my mouth inside the water before that lady dips her asshole in it."

1	Young boy goes up to his Dad and asks "Where did I come from?" His father sighs and says "I was hoping your mother would get this question but OK I will explain".  "So when a man and woman are in love and want to have a baby they get naked and get into bed and then they touch each other and kiss and the man touches the woman's breasts and vagina and the woman touches the man's penis and they kiss and the man's penis gets erect, which means it gets hard and the woman's vagina gets all wet and slippery which means its ready for the man to put his penis in there. So the man puts his penis into the woman's vagina and thrusts it in and out until he gets really excited and then he squirts his sperm which is his seed into the the woman's vagina. The sperm then swim up the vagina and through the cervix and into the uterus where the woman has an ova which is like an egg and then one sperm usually enters the ova and fertilizes it which starts the beginning of a baby. The this little thing grows and grows inside the woman's womb and then after nine months it is ready to come out. So the woman goes to the hospital and they take care of her while she goes into labour and the baby moves down her birth canal which is her womb and vagina and after a long time the baby finally comes out of the woman's vagina and that is where you came from". The father feeling quite proud of his explanation looks down at his son and sees the horrified expression on his face and confused he asks him "Why do you ask son?"  His terrified son replies "Because the new kid that moved in next door said he came from Baltimore"

She consented and he fondled them for several minutes.   “Father, could I ask something of you?"   “Yes sister?"   “I have never seen a man's penis. Could I see yours?"   “I supposed that would be OK," the priest replied lifting his robe.   “Oh father, may I touch it?"   This time the priest consented and after a few minutes of fondling he was sporting a huge erection.   “Sister, you know that if I insert my penis in the right place, it can give life."   “Is that true father?"   “Yes it is, sister."   “Then why don't you stick it up that camel's ass and lets get the hell out of here."

1	A ship is ambushed in the open ocean. After a couple hours of combat, the crew is overwhelmed and pirates come aboard. They proceed to line up the captured men and one by one ask who they think the best sailor is on their vessel. The majority of men say that the lookout Seamus has the most experience under his belt. Hearing this the pirates take Seamus, hoist him over their shoulders cheering, and march him to the helm. When the pirates get to the back of the boat they lift him high in the air, count to three, and hurl him overboard, still tied up, into the deep blue. The whole pirate crew shouts and applauds and then casually gets back to the daily routines of the ship. They even start a shanty while swabbing the deck, hoisting the sails and such. The captured sailors don’t believe what they are seeing.  The captain, noticing their expressions, grunts a laugh and says,  “M’boys, tis not an easy life as a pirate! We must do everything we can to get an edge on the competition. We be hated wherever we go! So your friend, tis’ nothing personal. We just wish to be the best there ever been.”  Bewildered, one of the sailors speaks up, “Then why on earth did you ask for our strongest sailor only to throw him to certain death?!” “Ahh...”, said the captain. “Little secret to life we found out there. We always take to throwing the best sailors as far as we can when we capture’m. You see gents... y’argh what yeet.”
2	A policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. &#x200B;  To test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"  The first guy answers, "That's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!" The policeman says, "Well...uh...that's because the picture I showed is his side profile."  Slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"  The second guy smiles, flips his hair, and says, "Ha! He'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"  The policeman angrily responds, "What's the matter with you two?? Of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! Is that the best answer you can come up with?"  Extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, "This is your suspect, how would you recognize him? He quickly adds, "Think hard before giving me a stupid answer."  The third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, "the suspect wears contact lenses."  The policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.  "Well, that's an interesting answer. Wait here for a few minutes while I check his file and I'll get back to you on that." He leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer, and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.  "Wow! I can't believe it. It's TRUE! The suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. Good work! How were you able to make such an astute observation?"  "That's easy," the third guy replied." He can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear."

Approaching the car, he notices there are 5 old ladies, two at the front and 3 at the back, wide eyed and looking like ghosts.  The driver obviously confused said,"Officer, I don't understand, I wasn't doing over the speed limit!, What seems to be the problem?" "Ma'am," the officer said, "you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be dangerous". "Slower than the speed limit? NO SIR! I was doing exactly 22 miles an hour", the old woman said proudly.  The officer containing a chuckle explains that 22 was the route number, not the speed limit. A bit embarrassed, the woman grinned, thanking the officer for pointing out her error. "Before I go Ma'am, I have to ask, is everyone OK?  These women seem badly shaken and haven't uttered a word all this time" "Oh! they will be alright in a minute, Officer, we just got off Route 142."

Hoping to try another career where skillful hands would be beneficial, he decided to become a mechanic. He went to the local technical college, signed up for evening classes, attended diligently, and learned all he could.  When the time of the practical exam approached, the gynecologist prepared carefully for weeks, and completed the exam with tremendous skill.  When the results came back, he was surprised to find that he had obtained a score of 150%. Fearing an error, he called the Instructor, saying, “I don’t want to appear ungrateful for such an outstanding result, but I wonder if there is an error in the grade?”  “The instructor said, “During the exam, you took the engine apart perfectly, which was worth 50% of the total mark. You put the engine back together again perfectly, which is also worth 50% of the mark.” After a pause, the instructor added, “I gave you an extra 50% because you did it all through the muffler, which I’ve never seen done in my entire career”.

1	World War I In World War I there was trench warfare, and neither the Americans nor the Germans could get the upper hand. They were reaching a stalemate. One day, an American came up with a plan that would win them the war. This private explained his plan to his trench mates, and they figured, "Why not? It's not like we have any better ideas." The next day, an American soldier called out, "Hans!?" A German popped up and shouted back, "Ja?!" Boom, the German was shot dead. The next day the Americans shouted again, "Hans?!" "Ja?!" Shot dead. This process continued over the next couple of days. The Germans were losing large numbers, and were now finally catching on. The Germans had an emergency meeting. They thought they could come back from the heavy losses using the same tactics as the Americans. Thus, a German asked, "What is a popular American name?" "John!" replied another. The next day, the Germans decided to execute their plan. A German shouted, "John!?" An American called back, "Is that you Hans?!" "Ja!" And that is how the Americans won WWI.
2	Didn't like shopping there anyway Yesterday I was at my local TESCO’ store buying a large bag of Winalot dog food for my loyal pet and was in the checkout queue when a woman behind me asked if I had a dog.  What did she think I had, an elephant? On impulse I told her that no, I didn't have a dog, I was starting the Winalot Diet again.   I added that I probably shouldn'’t, because I ended up in hospital last time, but I'd lost 2 stone before I woke up in intensive care with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and IVs in both arms.  I told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with Winalot nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. The food is nutritionally complete so it works well and I was going to try it again. (I have to mention here that practically everyone in queue was now enthralled with my story.)  Horrified, she asked me if I ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. I told her no, I stepped off the kerb to sniff an Irish Setter's arse and a car hit me.  I thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard.   I'm now banned from TESCO.

Yes, I've been unfaithful to you three times during these 50 years, but always for a good reason.  Henry was obviously hurt by his wife's confession, but said, "I never suspected. Can you tell me what you mean by 'good reasons?'"  Martha said, "The first time was shortly after we were married, and we were about to lose our little house because we couldn't pay the mortgage.Do you remember that one evening I went to see the banker and the next day he notified you that the loan would be extended?"  Henry recalled the visit to the banker and said, "I can forgive you for that. You saved our home, but what about the second time?"  Martha asked, "And do you remember when you were so sick, but we didn't have the money to pay for the heart surgery you needed? Well, I went to see your doctor one night and, if you recall, he did the surgery at no charge."  "I recall that," said Henry. "And you did it to save my life, so of course I can forgive you for that. Now tell me about the third time."  "Alright," Martha said. "So do you remember when you ran for president of your golf club, and you needed 73 more votes?"

"No no no, it's not what it looks like. Somebody was sick on me and he put a £20 note in my jacket pocket for the dry-cleaning bill".   His wife digs into his jacket pocket and pulls out some money.

2	The Highways Agency found over 200 dead crows on the A90 near Boston recently Initially there was concern that they may have died from Avian Flu. A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts.   However, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paints appeared on the ...bird's beaks and claws. By analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.  The Agency then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist from Harvard to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills.   The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger.   They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout "Cah", not a single one could shout "bike"

1	A man was recruited for a space colony He had been posted to a planet 14 lightyears from Sol. As his ship landed on the planet's glowing surface, he saw a car waiting for him.  "Welcome to Anti-Earth," The driver said, "don't worry we are going to change the name soon. I am here to take you to your quarters and show you the colony on the way."  They had been driving for a couple of minutes when the recruit saw glowing buildings far away.   "Why are the buildings shining like that?", he asked.  "Didn't they brief you about the colony?", the driver asked "We don't call it Anti-Earth for no reason, it's literally the opposite of Earth. Any element rare on Earth is as common as carbon (C) here, and interestingly carbon (C) doesn't occur naturally here. So we had to make good of what we had, the buildings are made of rare metals like radium (Ra) which glow in the dark."  After half an hour they arrived at what seemed the main highway, the road had a faint bluish glow and the sides were lined with metallic posts shining faintly in the double moonlight. They stopped near a small dilapidated shack with the words "COMMUNICATION OFFICE" crudely etched on the walls.   "This is your office. You are supposed to handle communications for the colony," the driver said. "We can't use any wireless communication as the high amount of radioactive gases in the atmosphere interferes with the signal, so we have to use a type of telegraph instead. Come on, I'll show you our most important resource."  They walked a bit till they reached a plantation full of bizarre trees. Some were made of precious metals, some of common earth metals and some of them were glowing radioactively.  "This is the plantation for building the posts. We brought these seeds from Earth and planted them, apparently as they couldn't get the conventional elements they just used what the soil contained. We just sell the gold (Au), silver (Ag) and platinum (Pt) trees to Earth, the iron (Fe) and aluminium (Al) are used for constructing equipment and there are some pretty rare elements like uranium (U) and astatine (At) (which is the rarest element on Earth) which are used for scientific research. However, these aren't what we are here for."   The driver motioned him to follow him towards a small area of trees with a silvery sheen to them.  "These are made of rhenium (Re) one of the densest elements with one of the highest melting and boiling points. It is strong enough to withstand the toxic atmosphere and radioactivity of this planet. So we use it to make the telegraph posts. As you may have noticed we have lined almost the whole road with telegraph lines."  "You don't mean...", the recruit began.  "Yes," the driver cut him off, "this place is full of (Re)posts."
1	Garden Snakes can be dangerous A couple in Sweetwater, Texas, had a lot of potted plants. During a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze.  It turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants. When it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa.  She let out a very loud scream.  The husband (who was taking a shower) ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was. She told him there was a snake under the sofa.  He got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it. About that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him on the behind. He thought the snake had bitten him, so he screamed and fell over on the floor.  His wife thought he had had a heart attack, so she covered him up, told him to lie still, and called an ambulance.  The attendants rushed in, would not listen to his protests, loaded him on the stretcher, and started carrying him out.  About that time, the snake came out from under the sofa and the Emergency Medical Technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher. That's when the man broke his leg and why he is still in the hospital.  The wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor who volunteered to capture the snake. He armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch.. Soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief.  But while relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt the snake wriggling around. She screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa.  The neighbor man, seeing her lying there passed out, tried to use CPR to revive her.  The neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.  The noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed that the snake had bitten him. She went to the kitchen and got a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.  By now, the police had arrived.  Breathe here...  They saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred. They were about to arrest them all, when the women tried to explain how it all happened over a little garden snake!  The police called an ambulance, which took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife.  Now, the little snake again crawled out from under the sofa and one of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it. He missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table. The table fell over, the lamp on it shattered, and, as the bulb broke, it started a fire in the drapes.  The other policeman tried to beat out the flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog who, startled, jumped out and raced into the street, where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car.  Meanwhile, neighbors saw the burning drapes and called in the fire department. The firemen had started raising the fire ladder when they were halfway down the street. The rising ladder tore out the overhead wires, put out the power, and disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area (but they did get the house fire out).  Time passed! Both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was repaired, the dog came home, the police acquired a new car and all was right with their world.  A while later they were watching TV and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night. The wife asked her husband if he thought they should bring in their plants for the night.  And that's when he shot her.

Where is your Ferrari ?"* asks the wife *"- Forget about the Ferrari, I have something even greater"*  He pulls out the lamp, scrubs it, the genie appears. The man then asks the genie to give his wife flowers, and the same Ferrari, but in a different color.  To what the genie answers *"Sorry sir, I can only grant you cold beers"*

Then one was on my tail and I couldn't shake the Fokker, but my pal took care of him. Then I took out two more of the Fokkers..."  The teacher interrupts "Children I should explain, the Fokker was a type of fighter airplane used by the German Air Force to stop the RAF bombers and their escorts."  "Yes, but these Fokkers were Messerschmitts!"  &#x200B;  Seriously, Remembrance Day is next week, please support your veterans. 145 polish pilots participated in the Battle of Britain and without them, the outcome could have been vastly different. " Never was so much owed by so many to so few"

"Nope" she said laughing. He then said, "Alright, you seem to be okay with it. I am coming up the stairs now!"

Everyday I come down to the water and whistle and these lobster jump out and I take them for a walk only to return them at the end of the day."

1	The Four Balconies- NSFW There was an apt building with 4 balconies. On the bottom one there was a guy that loved to eat pickles every day out there. On the balcony above him was an eccentric painter that was obsessed with the color green and if anything, even a leaf flew by, he'd grab it and paint it green. On the 3rd balcony was a guy who got his jollies taking his daily piss off the balcony. On the forth and top balcony was a guy that liked so do his daily shave off the balcony with a straight razor. One day all four guys were on their respective balconies. The guy shaving slipped and dropped his razor over the edge, they guy below him was sadly having his morning piss and the razor falling sliced his cock right off. The cock caught they eye of the eccentric painter that hurriedly painted it green before dropping it off his balcony into the hands of the final guy who excitedly grabbed it and yelled "Yay! pickles from heaven" *chomp*  Yea, it's lame, I know. Heard it in school circa 1990 and just remembered it randomly today.

2	A Chemist, an Engineer, an Electrician and an IT guy get stranded on the side of the road after their car break down... It’s the dead of winter and the wind chill is below freezing. One of them gets off the phone with the towing company, “they said it’s going to be at least two hours.” They all stay in the car.    After a few minutes the Chemist tells the other three, “I’m pretty sure I know what happened... the engine oil probably hadn’t been changed in a long time, became oxidized and contaminated, lost its ability to lubricate therefore completely seizing the pistons to the cylinder walls of the engine. It’ll have to be replaced.”   The Engineer tells the others “I’m fairly certain the planetary gear set or valve body inside the transmission failed, likely due to a poor design. These cars aren’t exactly the greatest and it’s a known issue, that’s why it broke down. The transmission will have to be replaced.”   The Electrician says “you guys are overreacting, it’s probably just a blown fuse or relay that burned out causing the car to shut off. We can check the integrity of the fuse box, make sure there’s no excessive resistance or a short to ground that caused it to blow in the first place. I have my multimeter in the trunk. We can just swap it out and we’ll be on our way.”   The IT guy looks around and says “What if, uh... what if we just get out of the car and then get back in again?”

2	A boy sees a beautiful girl across the street. After they hit it off, he goes home and excitedly tells his dad the news.  “Dad, I just got to know this amazing girl across the street! She lives really close by and her name is Jenna. I really like her!”  The father winces and looks at him. “Son, I’m sorry to tell you this, but Jenna is actually your sister. I had a fling with the neighbor before I began to date your mother.”  Dejected, the son leaves the room and cuts off all communication with her.  A month goes by and the son meets another girl,  named Valerie. They flirt with each other, find out she lives down the street, and the son goes back home and tells his father.  The father winces again. “Sorry son, but Valerie is actually your sister as well.”  In the middle of his explanation, the son storms out of the room and leaves the house to take a breather, while cutting off all communication with Valerie.  Three months later, the son meets the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen, prettier than the last two girls combined. He finds out her name is Brooke, and rushes home after exchanging numbers, leaving little time to actually talk to her.  The son busts into his father’s room.   “Dad, I met this girl named Brooke, and she lives a few streets away. Before I tell you about her, is she your daughter too?”  A moment goes by and the son begins to hope that this girl is finally the one.  And then the father winces.  The son leaves the room and goes to sit in the living room to cool his head after finding out three girls he’s had feelings for are actually his sisters.  After a few hours, his mother sits down next to him.  “Honey, what’s wrong? You’ve been very sad as of late.”  In tears, the son turns to his mother. “I’m upset because I met three amazing girls who all seemed interested in me these past few months, and every single time, dad’s told me that they’re actually my sisters!”  The mother looks bewildered and begins to laugh.  “Mom, why are you laughing?”  “Oh honey, don’t worry about a thing. Date any of those girls!”  The son makes a face of disgust and disbelief. “Why would I date any of my father’s daughters?”  The mother smiles.  “Because he isn’t actually your father.”

Upon hearing this the diplomats and bodyguards quickly go around the corner to discuss what to do.  A few moments later they return: "We would like to take the president's remains home please". The undertaker is confused and asks: "Why would you want to spend $50000 to get him home when you could have everything done here, in the holy land of all places, for just $100?"  One of the diplomats replies: "A long time ago, a man died here and he resurrected after just 3 days, we don't want to take any risks."

2	There was an old man who lived by a forest. As he grew older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald. That day, he called his children to a meeting... He said, "Look at my hair. It used to be so magnificent, but it's completely gone now. My hair can't be saved. But look outside at the forest. It's such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they'll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair."  "What I want you to do..." the man continued. "Is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong."  So they did.  Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.  And for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.

At that statement, the jeweler went to his special stock and brought another ring over. "Here's a stunning ring at only $40,000," the jeweler said.  The lady's eyes sparkled and her whole body trembled with excitement. The old man seeing this said, "We'll take it."  The jeweler asked how payment would be made and the man stated, "By check. I know you need to make sure my check is good, so I'll write it now and you can call the bank Monday to verify the funds. I'll pick the ring up Monday afternoon."  On Monday morning, the jeweler angrily phoned the old man and said "Sir... There's no money in that account."  "I know," said the old man. "But let me tell you about my weekend."

2	The madam of a whore house answered the ring of the bell and, on opening the door, she found standing there on the threshold, an ancient, bearded gentleman in Rabbi's garb.  "May I come in?" asked the Rabbi gently in an aged, quavering voice. Feeling a little confused, the madam said, "But Rabbi, surely you must be in the wrong place. Here is where we..."  "I know what you do here," interrupted the Rabbi. "You don't think I came here for chopped liver, do you? Bring on the girls."  Still confused, but understanding her professional duties, the madam had several girls line up. The Rabbi tottered from one to another until he reached Rose, a large redhead with enormous breasts. He looked at her with appreciation and pointed, "Good! I'll take those."  The Rabbi paid out the necessary sum and Rosie led him upstairs. She helped him off with his coat and hung it up carefully on the nail on the door. Then she helped him off with the rest of his clothes and got into bed. There, to Rosie's astonishment, the Rabbi performed with an address and a skill that was unbelievable. In fact, Rosie, a hardened professional, found herself surprised into orgasm.  As they lay in bed a few minutes afterwards, relaxing, Rosie said, "How old are you, Rabbi?" The Rabbi said, "God has been good to me. I am eighty-eight years old." "That is certainly amazing. Listen, Rabbi, if you're ever in the neighborhood again and if you should feel in the mood, please ask for me - Rosie. I would be delighted to oblige you."  The Rabbi said, with a certain hauteur, "What do you mean, if I should be in the mood again? Let me sleep for five minutes right now and, believe me, I will be in the mood again." "Really, Rabbi? Then please take a nap."  "Okay." The Rabbi adjusted himself into a relaxed position, face up, placed his arms across his chest and then said, "Wait one minute. This is important. While I'm asleep, scoop up my testicles with your right hand and hold them an inch above the sheet, without moving them. Keep them absolutely motionless." "Of course, Rabbi," said Rosie, and did as she was told, holding the Rabbi's testicles free of the sheet. For five minutes the Rabbi slept, then woke with a start and said, "I'm ready." And so he was, for, to Rosie's delight, he was even better the second time than the first. As she lay panting, Rosie said, "It was wonderful, Rabbi, but one thing I don't understand. Why was it necessary to hold your testicles motionless above the sheet while you were sleeping?"  "Oh that," said the Rabbi. "Well, you are a nice girl and I like you very much. Still, the truth is I don't know you very well, and over there, in my coat, hanging on the hook on the door, is fifteen hundred dollars.”

1	A wealthy urbanite decides that he wants to start a farm... ... so he heads out into the countryside to ask for his cousin's help.  "The way I see it," the man says, "I should probably start small. I'll need a chicken and a rooster, and I'll also need a donkey to haul my cultivator."  The cousin scratches his chin as he listens to this. "Well, even before that," he replies, "you'll need to learn the right terminology. Around these parts, you'd say 'I need a pullet and a cock, plus an ass to haul my plow.'"  The man thanks his cousin for the lesson, then leaves to examine nearby farms. He comes limping back less than an hour later, looking like he has been beaten to within an inch of his life.  "What happened?!" the cousin exclaims. "Did you get thrown off a horse?!"  The man shakes his head. "I met a farmer with a broken cultivator attached to his donkey, and I wanted to make a neighborly first impression... but I tried to do some more research at the same time."  "'Research?'" the cousin repeats.  "Yeah," the man replies. "So I walked over to the farmhouse and found his wife. I asked her, 'Hey, can I look at your husband's cock and pullet?' When she said no, I said, 'Well, at least let me give his ass a good plow!'"

The man's eyes light up, he thinks again, and says, "I'd also like to be attractive to women. Beautiful women." The little guy smiles again and replies, "Done!  When you step out of here, gorgeous women will find your irresistible! Now, what'll it be for your final wish?"  The man thinks for a while. Finally, he says, "Uhhh... I'd like a really big dick... one like yours." The little guy thinks, frowns, holds his chin, and says "Hmmm. This will not be so easy. Wait... I have an idea... let's step over to this stall over there. You get on your hands and knees, and I'll push yours out from the backside. Yes, this will definitely work."  The man is shocked but thinks what the hell, it'll be worth it. So they go to the stall, he gets down, and the little guy starts buggering him.

Next time they stop at a light, he places his hand a little higher up on her thigh, again the nun says, “Remember Luke 14:10, Father.”  The priest apologizes, “The flesh is weak.”  So he drops her off, and when he gets home, he reaches for his bible and flips to Luke 14:10.   “Friend, come up higher, then shalt thou have glory!”

"Tell me! Did you find her?" Michael Patrick O'Flynn asked. The constable said, "I have some bad news, some good news, and some really great news. Which would you like to hear first?"   Fearing the worst, Mr. O' Flynn said, "Give me the bad news first." The constable said, "I'm sorry to tell you, sir, but early this morning we found your poor wife's body in the bay." "Lord sufferin' Jesus and Holy Mother of God!" exclaimed O' Flynn. Swallowing hard, he asked,"What could possibly be the good news?"  The constable continued, "When we pulled the late, departed poor Maureen up, she had 12 of the best-looking Atlantic lobsters that you have ever seen clinging to her. Haven't seen lobsters like that since the 1960's, and we feel you are entitled to a share in the catch."  Stunned, Mr. O' Flynn demanded, "Glory be to God, if that's the good news, then what's the really great news?"  The constable replied, "We're gonna pull her up again tomorrow."

I need you to give him a message,” she continues, slyly popping a couple of her fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently. “What should I tell him?” the bartender manages to say.  “Tell him,” she whispers, “there is no toilet paper or hand soap in the ladies room.”

1	Two old women are sitting on a porch smoking cigarettes. Ask they are smoking, it begins to rain. The first woman's cigarette gets wet, and goes out. As she looks to her friend, she sees something fascinating unfold.  Her friend has brought out a condom and a pair of small sewing scissors. She unrolls the condom, cuts off the end of it, and slips it over her cigarette like a tiny raincoat and continues smoking.   "Why, Ethyl!" the fist lady exclaims, "where on earth did you get that?"     "Oh just at the pharmacy down the road, Doris, I pick a few up every time the forecast says it might rain. I do hate to waste a perfectly good Marlboro."  The next day, Doris checks the forecast and thinks it might be a good idea to get herself a few condoms for her cigarettes as well. When she arrives at the pharmacy, and is standing in front of the shelf of condoms, she realizes she doesn't know what size she needs as she smokes a different brand of cigarette than Ethyl's Marlboros.  A staff member sees the old woman staring thoughtfully at the shelf and goes to ask her if she needs any assistance. "Is there a particular brand you're looking to buy?" he says.  "Oh, I don't mind which brand," says Doris, "Just as long as it fits a Camel."

He gives each friend an envelope with $1,000,000 in cash, and makes them all swear to bury the money with him when he dies. They all shake hands and solemnly agree.   A few months later the man dies, and the three friends place their envelopes in the casket.  Later, privately, the doctor tells the others: "Gentlemen, I confess that my envelope did not have the full million dollars in it. Last winter the hospital badly needed a new dialysis machine. It cost $50,000. I feel that Bob would have approved, as it will save countless lives."  Then the priest says: "I too have a confession. My envelope also did not have the full million dollars in it. The church orphanage badly needed repairs, which cost $60,000. We are naming a new wing in Bob's honor, and I am sure he would have approved."  Then the lawyer speaks up: "Gentlemen! I am ashamed of you. This was Bob's dying wish! And you could not obey it? I assure you that MY envelope contained a CHECK for the FULL million dollars!"

Then he saw an Envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow that was addressed to 'Dad.'   With the worst premonition he opened the envelope with trembling hands and read the letter.   Dear  Dad: It is with great regret and sorrow that I'm writing you.  I had to elope with my new girlfriend because I wanted to avoid a scene with Mom and you.   I have been finding real passion with Stacy and she is so nice.   But I knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing, tattoos,  tight motorcycle clothes and the fact that she is much older than I am.  But it is not only the passion…Dad she is pregnant.  Stacy said that we will be very happy.   She owns a trailer in the woods and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. We share a dream of having many more children.   Stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone.   We'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people that live nearby for cocaine and ecstasy.   In the meantime we will pray that science will find a cure  for AIDS so Stacy can get better. She deserves it.   Don't worry Dad. I'm 15 and I know how to take care of myself.   Someday I'm sure that we will be back to visit so that  you can get to know your grandchildren.  Love, Your Son John   PS. Dad, none of the above is true.  I'm over at Tommy's house.   I Just wanted to remind you that there are worse things  in life than a Report card That's in my center desk drawer.   I love you. Call me when it is safe to come home

Finally, he asked her if they could start a physical relationship, so as to attend to each other's needs.  Heidi was game and a very nice sexual relationship began.   After several months, the guy approached Heidi and said, "I have a problem. It's kind of a guy thing, but I need to ask you a favour."  Heidi replied, "Okay," to which he asked, "Can I borrow your eyebrow pencil?" Heidi looked at him in confusion, but obliged.   The guy then asked, "Do you mind if I use the eyebrow pencil to draw a mustache on you?" Heidi was growing worried, but again obliged, so the guy drew a mustache on her.   Then the guy said, "Can you wear some of my clothes? I need for you to look more like a man." Heidi was becoming disappointed at this point, but hesitantly put on his clothes.   Finally, the guy said to Heidi, "Do you mind if I call you Phil?" Heidi had now become very dejected, and said "No, I guess not, you can call me Phil."  So, the guy reached out and grabbed Heidi by the arms and shouted "Phil, you'll never believe who I'm fucking!"

1	An old lady is sitting with her doctor “I’ve been having the most terrible flatulence, doctor. I just can’t stop passing gas. Luckily, they’re silent and they don’t smell at all. Why, you couldn’t tell but I’ve farted at least five or six times in the few minutes I’ve been here with you.”  The doctor pulled out his prescription pad and began writing.  “Are these pills to help with my stomach?”  The doctor replied, “no – your sense of smell.”

Your wife has Gonorrhea.   Your car is about to throw a rod.   And if you don’t stop beating off, your tennis elbow is never gonna heal.
2	[Dark Humor] [Long] [NSFW] A joke, from Russia with love ;) Sry if anyone is offended. Not my intention. Long, Russian joke I know which I translated to the best I could. Not really pc. Sry D:  A Russian, a German and a Jew stand on the roof of a burning skyscraper. The floors beneath them are engulfed in flames. No where to run. The 3 man, in sheer panic, have nowhere to escape to.  So the Russian goes to ledge and thinks for himself: "I don't want to die. Not in such a gruesome way like burning alive. I rather jump from the building an take my chances." But he still fears death so he stops at the ledge and doesn't know which to pick. Suddenly an angel appears before him and says: "Russian, listen to me: Believe in the lord, send him your prayers and he will safe you. The lord is your Shepard. Just believe in him and jump!"  The Russian, full of doubt but with no other way out, decides to believe in this strange occurrence, goes for the ledge and with a last prayer on his lips, jumps off the building. He falls to the ground with a gut wrenching sound BUT survives without a scratch or even a bit of dust on him and walks away euphorically.  On the roof, both of the remaining men, after witnessing this wonder, starts praying to the lord furiously.  The German decides to try his luck and goes to the ledge. And to his surprise, the same angel appears before him and says :  "German, don't doubt the lord. If you pray to him and believe in his might, he will safe you from this deathtrap. Just believe and let go of all your doubts."  So the German stands there, scared to die, scared to jump. But after a few seconds he goes: "Ach, scheiß drauf (ah fuck it)!” Prays for the last time and goes over the ledge. And with an unholy sound, he slaps onto the ground, but, o praise the lord, with not a single scratch to his body. Frolicking to be alive, he wanders off.  The last guy, Jewish as he is, never doubted the power of the lord, always lived by the Bible and never stopped to believe in the lord. He witnesses those miracles and is happy because he knows that the lord is with them and that he, also will survive. So he goes to the ledge and waits for the angel to appear. And as expected, the same angel appears and says to the Jew:  "Ah I see you are a man of God. I don't need to tell you what to do, as I see, you are prepared and full of faith. So go on, child of the lord, believe and be saved"  Without missing a beat, the Jew closes his eyes, with a smile on his face, jumps of the roof, hits the ground and....dies.  At the same time he dies, his soul goes to heaven and he opens his eyes before the gates of heaven. Seriously confused about his whereabouts, it dawn's on him that he died and is even more confused. Suddenly, the gates opens and God himself appears before the Jew, but although he may be the almighty one, he still seems surprised to see the Jew infront of heavens gate. Therefore he asks him, how he ended up here because he should have lived another 70 years. The man explains God the whole situation and God listens carefully and after a brief moment speaks:  "Well, that didn't go well for you, I am sorry for that. Say, if I get you the angel, would you recognise him again?”  "Of course I would" says the Jew.  So be it. The lord summons all his angels, line's them up and says to the Jew: " Alright, now show me the angel who brought you in this situation."  The Jew slowly goes around, checks the angels and with a grasp suddenly points towards one angel.  J: "That's him, this is the angel who lied to me!" G: "This one, on the far right? Are you absolutely sure??” J: "I am 100% sure that's him. I'd never dare to lie infront of the lord himself!"  God (with sheer frustration in his voice): "Oh for fucks sake! How many time do I need to tell you! Just stop it with them Jews, Adolf!!!"

Anticipating an even bigger mansion, the priest was dismayed when they arrived at a small 1-bedroom apartment.  "St. Peter, I'm a little puzzled," the priest began. "As a clergyman, I devoted decades of my life solely to serving the Lord. How come the taxi driver got a villa, and for me, only a small apartment?"  St. Peter smiled. "Up here, we go by results. While you preached, people slept; while he drove, people prayed."

1	A man wakes up A man wakes up in a dimly lit room with three doors. On each door, there is a picture of a different type of food. The first door has a picture of eggs, second has a picture of cereal and the third has a picture of beans.   The man decides to try the first door, so he opens it. Behind it is a beautiful woman with three eggs for breasts. She says, “Egg tits? You can have as much as you like!” Of course, the man accepts. The woman could make her chest transform into any kind of dish as long as it was only eggs. Omelets, deviled, poached, scrambled, of the man could name it, it would be there. However, the food was never seasoned, so it always tasted a bit dull.   He eats nothing but eggs for a solid month and has great sex with the triple breasted woman almost every six hours, but soon, he gets bored of the same meal and same woman. So, he decides to open the second door.   Behind the second door, there lies an even more beautiful woman, but this time she has two literal jugs on her chest filled with cereal. “Jug tits?” The new woman asked. She had hardly finished her sentence before the man was on top of her, eating. The man has never been happier in his life, not that he could remember anything before he got to the mysterious room. The woman, like the last one, could create any type of cereal he wanted. Lucky Charms, Trix, Honey Bunches of Oats, even certain types of granola were manageable.   The next two and a half months, the man eats eggs and cereal while he searches for a way out, never deciding to open the third door as to not add a new food to his palate so he doesn’t get bored. However, the room seems impenetrable.   The morning of the fourth week, the man wakes up and the eggs and cereal are tasteless. The man wished that there could be some milk to go with the cereal or some bacon for the eggs, but alas the women could only conjure up their specific item. After a while, the women grew unhappy with him and begged him to open the third door. They said that maybe there would be a way out.   The man sighed, despaired, and knew he had waited long enough, so finally, he threw open the third and final door, labeled beans. The woman inside had one can of beans for a breast and she smiled at the man. The man screamed, “Oh my god! Not another one of you! I can’t handle any more of this! Can this get any worse?”  The woman replied, grinning, “Can tit?”

"Adam, what you have done is a sin! You and Eve must both be punished." He looks around. "Where is Eve anyway?"  Adam replies "well, she enjoyed it so much she wants to do it again. She's down by the river washing her vagina."  "Oh, great" God replies. "Now, on top of everything else, all the fish will smell funny too!"
1	Oh flower of scotland when will we see, yer lights again! +Title unrelated+  An American photographer on vacation was inside Westminster Abbey taking photographs when he noticed a golden telephone mounted on the wall with a sign that read '£10,000 per call'.  The American, being intrigued, asked a priest who was strolling by what the telephone was used for.  The priest replied that it was a direct line to heaven and that for £10,000 you could talk to God.  The American thanked the priest and went along his way.  Next stop was in Lincoln There, at the cathedral, he saw the same golden telephone with the same sign under it.  He wondered if this was the same kind of telephone he saw in London and he asked a nearby nun what its purpose was.  She told him that it was a direct line to heaven and that for £10,000 he could talk to God.  'O.K., thank you,' said the American.  He then travelled to York , Durham and Liverpool  In every Cathedral he saw the same golden telephone with the same '£10,000 per call' sign under it.  The American, upon leaving the N of England decided to travel to Scotland to see if the Scots had the same phone.  He arrived in Glasgow, and again, as he entered the cathedral , there was the same golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read '50 pence per call.'  The American was surprised so he asked the priest about the sign. 'Reverend, I've travelled all over England and I've seen this same golden telephone in many churches. I'm told that it is a direct line to heaven, but in England the price was £10,000 per call. Why is it only 50pence here?'  The priest smiled and answered, 'You're in Scotland now, son .... it's a local call.'

The mortician asks the deceased's wife how she would like the body dressed, pointing out that the man does look good in the black suit he is already wearing.  The widow, however, says that she always thought her husband looked his best in blue, and that she wants him in a blue suit. She gives the mortician a blank check and says, 'I don't care what it costs, but please have my husband in a blue suit for the viewing.'  The woman returns the next day and to her delight, she finds her husband dressed in a gorgeous blue suit with a subtle chalk stripe; the suit fits him perfectly.  She says to the mortician, 'Whatever this cost, I'm very satisfied.. You did an excellent job and I'm very grateful. How much did you spend?'  To her astonishment, the mortician presents her with the blank check, 'There's no charge.'  'No, really, I must compensate you for the cost of that exquisite blue suit,' she says.  'Honestly, ma'am,' the mortician says, 'it cost nothing. You see, a deceased gentleman of about your husband's size was brought in shortly after you left yesterday, and he was wearing an attractive blue suit. I asked his wife if she minded him going to his grave wearing a black suit instead, and she said it made no difference as long as he looked nice.'  'So I just switched the heads.'

So, eventually he tells his clientele, “Every day when I sweep outside there’s this dumb boy that comes by and I offer him a dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other, and he always chooses the quarter. What a sucker!” His customers don’t believe this, and they wait to watch it in person.  Sure enough after work when the man is sweeping outside the boy comes walking up again. The man shows him one dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other, and the boy chooses the quarter and walks off. The customers are left dumbfounded. “See, that dumb kid always chooses the quarter! What a sucker!”  The next day, the same thing happens again. The man shows a dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other hand, and again the boy takes the quarter. Dumbfounded for the last time, the man can’t take it any longer and asks the boy, “Boy, why is it, when I offer you a dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other, you always take the quarter?”  The boy replies, “Because if I took the dollar the game would be over.”

Lime points it out and says, "ten dollars if you climb to the top first". Lemon and pea, being good sports, agree and each put 10 dollars in. They race up the hill as fast as they can and Lime wins. Lemon and pea are mad, but don't care enough and pay up. They look down and Pea, being the youngest, says, "yknow, as a kid I'd roll down these types of hills", and being the drunk two friends Lemon and Lime were, they immediately went down. First Lemon, then Lime, then Pea. Finally, as Pea rolled down, Lemon vomited in a nearby trash bin. Pea was jumping up and down and yelling "another! Another!", but Lime grabbed his shoulder and said:     "Easy peasy, Lemon's queasy"

4	So, This is a very famous joke from my country ,I hope to see the response A conference for who the best actor in the world was held, Actors from all around the world came to take part in the competition.There were many qualifier rounds but then only 5 actors remained in the finals.  The final contest was decided to be a manual cow milking competition. The rules were simple, The one to milk the most milk from their respective cows won the competition.  The actors were from Nepal (the place where the joke is from), India (A neighbouring country so it is used), USA (Land of Chuck Norris), UK  and China.  They were each given a cow and 1 hour of alloted time to milk the cow.  The competition started and then ended soon.  Then the judges went on and checked how much they each milked.  They went and checked UK's representative (Michael Caine). He only milked 10 ltrs. of milk.  Then they moved onto China's Jet Li. Using his martial arts technique, he milked an astonishing 20 ltr. of milk from the cow.  Then Rajnikant (Indian counterpart of Chuck Norris,ask indians they'll tell) patted Li on the back and showed them he had milked 25 ltrs.   Chuck Norris was already laughing at them. For he had milked 30 ltrs. of milk  Now, The judges moved onto Rajesh Hamal (He's the Nepalese counterpart to Chuck Norris). When they looked into his bucket, They were astounded. He had only milked 1 ltr. of milk     They declared Chuck to be the winner and later interviewed everyone.    When it was Rajesh's turn, they asked " Why only 1 ltr?"   To which he replied "Those mfers gave me a bull"

1	So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.    ## So there was this man in Bulgaria who drove trains for a living.  He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, b**ut a sing**le person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.      Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back by driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.      Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.      "You know what? No," said the executioner. "I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now." Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped into the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.  The man looked at the executioner and said, "Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."

He asks one of the employees if they have a cheaper parrot.   “Actually, we have one parrot that nobody has wanted to buy. His name is Chet and he very lovable, but he’s only got one leg.”  The man asks to see this parrot. The employee goes to the back and brings out a very old, one-legged parrot.   The man asks if the parrot can do any tricks.   “Well, if you hold a match right under the stump of his leg, he will sing a Christmas song for you.”  The man is intrigued and holds a match under the parrots leg. The bird begins to sing.   “Jingle bells, Jingle bells, jingle all the way”  The man laughs and asks if he can do anything else.   The employee says,   “Well, you could try to put the match under the other leg and see what happens.”  So the man puts the match under the parrot’s leg. To their astonishment, the bird begins to sing again.   “Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus right down Santa Claus lane!”  The man is mystified by the parrot and how good it sounds. But he decides to try one more thing. So he asks,  “What would happen if you put the match between the parrot’s leg?”  The employee laughs.   “I don’t know what would happen,” he says. “You could try it.”  So the man puts the match between the parrot’s leg. Again, the bird begins to sing.   “Chet’s Nuts roasting on an open fire...”

1	A little old lady walked into the Bank of Canada A little old lady went into the Bank of Canada one day carrying a bag of money. She insisted that she must speak with the president of the bank to open a savings account because "it’s a lot of money." After much hemming and hawing, the bank staff finally ushered her into the president’s office. The bank president then asked how much she would like to deposit. She replied, "$165,000.00." and dumped the cash out of her bag on to his desk. The president was of course curious as to how she had come by all this cash, so he asked her, " Ma’am, I’m surprised you’re carrying so much cash around, Where did you get this money?" The old lady replied, " I make bets." He then asked, " Bets? What kind of bets?" The old woman said, " well for example, I’ll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square." "Ha", laughed the president, " that’s a stupid bet. You could never win that kind of bet." The old lady challenged, "So, would you like to take my bet?" "Sure," said the president, "I’ll bet $25,000 that my balls are not square."The little old lady then said, "Okay, but since there is so much money involved, may I bring my lawyer with me tomorrow at 10:00 am as a witness?" "Sure" replied the president. That night, he became very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of the mirror checking his balls, turning form side to side, again and again. He thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet. The next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president’s office. She introduced the lawyer and repeated the bet. "$25,000 says the president’s balls are square." The president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. The president complied. The little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them. "Well, Okay," said the president, "$25,000 is a lot of money, so I guess you should be absolutely sure." Just then he noticed the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. The president asked the old lady, "What the hell’s the matter with your lawyer?" She replied, "Nothing, except I bet him $100,000 that at 10:00 am today, I’d have the bank of Canada’s president’s balls in my hand.

1	A plane crashes on a deserted tropical island in the carribean. Three men survive. But to their surprise, the island wasn't deserted, and they found a cannibalistic society on the island. The cannibals trapped and wounded the three men, and told them that they would let them live, if they followed their instructions. The three men agreed, and the first instruction was this; all three of them had to look all over the island, and pick a fruit each, once they got a fruit, they where to come back to them. So all three men went out looking for fruits. The first guy comes running back with an apple, and the cannibal told him to put the whole thing up his ass without making a noise, a scream, a whimper, anything or he'd die. So he slowly started putting the apple up his ass. It slipped in there and he screamed in pain, and then got stabbed. The second man came walking back with 3 grapes, and the cannibal told him the same thing, put all 3 grapes up there without making a noise, or he will die. So he put the first grape up, no problem, the second grape, and on the third grape he was on the floor laughing his ass off, he was stabbed. Now, in the after world, the first man was curious to why the second man laughed. "You where so close, why did you laugh so hard" And he gave a chuckle and said "I saw the John coming back with a pineapple"
1	The Paperboy A paperboy is doing his monthly round of collecting money from customers.  One door is opened by a fairly sexy buxom woman who is wearing a transparent lace negligee.  “Hi, Missus, I’ve come for the paper money. It’s $5 please,” says our boy, with his hand held out.  “I’m afraid I’ve no money in the house,” the woman replies in a breathy voice, “but if you come in I’m sure I can think of something...”  So our lad goes in and the woman throws herself back on the fireside rug, pulling off the negligee, moaning, “You can have ME instead...”  The kid sighs, takes off his bag, and then produces a dick that wouldn’t look out of place on a stud bull. The woman is agog. Our lad then produces a load of big rubber rings from his bag, which he proceeds to stack around his giant knob.  “What are they for?” asks the woman.  “Oh, they’re just to make sure I don’t go all the way in when I fuck you,” replies the boy.  “To hell with them!” implores the woman. “I’ll take all of you!”  Our lad replies... “Not for five fucking dollars you won’t!”

5	A Marine returns from duty in Iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in Afghanistan. That evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.  As he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.  The next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. At the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.  As the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! The naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.  Confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...  "These men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over Afghanistan." He says, "Instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive Allah's justice, then return home."  The marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.  After 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.  "Hey, my last post was in Korea, how is it here?" Asks the replacement. "And what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?"  "Well, I'll be honest with you", replies the marine, "this a shit post, and what you're looking at here is a criminal punch line."

I don't know how, but it's kept me fit and healthy all my life."  The boy takes his great grandfather's advice, and indeed it works remarkably. The boy grew up and left behind 4 children, 9 grandchildren, 22 great-grandchildren, and a 16 foot hole in the crematorium wall.

2	A man on vacation is having horrible stomach pains, and realizes he has a tapeworm... The resort doctor taps on his stomach a few times, listening with a stethoscope. Then he tells the man, "Come back tomorrow with a banana and a cookie."  "Ummm... okay..." the guy says, skeptical. "What for?"  "Do you want my help, or don't you!?" the doctor says. "Just do what I tell you!"  So the guy leaves and comes back the next day with a banana and a cookie. He tells the doctor his stomach pain is even worse. The doctor tells him to drop his pants and bend over. The guy does. Next thing you know, the doctor is shoving the banana up his ass.   "The hell do you think you're doing!?" the man screams.  "You want my help, or don't you?"  His stomach is aching, so he clenches his fists and lets the doc proceed. The doctor shoves the banana all the way up his ass. And then looks at his watch for ten minutes. Then she shoves the cookie up his the man's ass too.   The man is shaking badly from pain. The doctor tells him to come back tomorrow and bring a banana and a cookie.   "Again!?"  "You want my help, or don't you?"  So the guy goes away and comes back the next day with a banana and a cookie. The exact same thing happens. This time the man is shaking and crying by the end of it. The doctor tells him to come back the next day with a banana and a cookie.   "You want my help or don't you?" the doctor says, cutting off the man's protests.   So once again, the guy returns, and gets a banana, and ten minutes later, a cookie shoved up his ass. He's sobbing by the end of it. But this time the doctor tells him, "Tomorrow, bring a banana and a hammer."  "Oh God! What the hell are you going to do to me now!?" the man says, and he leaves sobbing.   But the next day, he returns with a banana and a hammer. The doctor tells him to drop his pants, and once again he shoves the banana up the man's ass. Then he waits.   Ten minutes later, the tapeworm pops his head out of the man's butthole. "Hey! Where the fuck's my cookie!?"  BAM!

Cabbie: "He always knew the quickest way to go in traffic and avoid traffic jams. Not like me, I always seem to get stuck in them. But Frank, he never made a mistake, and he really knew how to treat a woman and make her feel good. He would never answer her back even if she was in the wrong; and his clothing was always immaculate, shoes highly polished too. He was the perfect man! He never made a mistake. No one could ever measure up to Frank Feldman."   Passenger: "How did you meet him?"   Cabbie: "I never actually met Frank. He died and I married his wife."
2	A couple fingers, Vaseline, and the grace of God Not an original joke but hilarious nonetheless. Presented for your enjoyment.   This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years. The only friction in their marriage was the husband's habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke.  The noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air.  Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor. She was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out.  The years went by and he continued to rip them out! Then one Thanksgiving morning as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the bowl where she had put the turkey innards and neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts and a malicious thought came to her.  She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling back the bed covers, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts.  Some time later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bathroom.  The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good.  About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his bloodstained underpants with a look of horror on his face.  She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, "Honey, you were right. All these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you."  "What do you mean?" asked his wife.  "Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened. But by the grace of God, some Vaseline, and these two fingers, I think I got most of them back in."

Can I get a Martini? House vodka, please." Bewildered and in awe at a talking bear in his bar, the bartender finally spits out, "Uh, yeah. Yes, of course," and starts making it. He brings the martini to him and sets it on the bar. The bear takes a sip of his drink and nods his head sideways expressing a small distaste for it. He puts a 20 down, "It'll just be the one for me today." The bartender takes the money, goes to the register and thinks to himself: This is a bear. There's no way he's been to other bars, I mean, he's not a part of society! How could he know what a martini costs? I'll bet he wouldn't know the difference if I charge him extra. He hands the bear 2 dollars for change. The bear pockets it. "You know, we don't get a lot of...bears...in here." the bartender says, still staring. The bear finishes his drink and says, "Well, 18 dollars for a house martini, I would think not."

1	Gruesome deaths Three men go to heaven. At the gates, St. Peter tells them that heaven is currently overloading, and only people who have had particularly gruesome or sad deaths may enter. He then proceeds to ask the first man how he died.  "Well, it's a really weird story. I came home from work early because I suspected that my wife was cheating on me," started the first man. "I barged onto the house and found her naked in the bedroom. Furious, I started looking for the asshole.  "I looked everywhere and couldn't find him, until I went into the balcony and saw a man hanging off the guardrails. I started punching his fingers, but he managed to hold on. Enraged, I went inside, brought out a hammer and smashed his fingers flat. He had to let go, but the lucky bastard fell in some bushes and was very much alive. At that point, I lost my mind, picked up the refrigerator and hurled it onto him. I assume he died, but the experience was so traumatizing that I had a heart attack myself and died."  St. Peter feels sorry for the man and lets him inside. He then asks the second man about his death.  "Well it's a rather odd story," he says. "I was peacefully doing yoga in the balcony of my house. By a combination of some spilt water and me losing my balance, I tumbled over the edge. Luckily, I managed to grab onto the guardrails of the balcony of the apartment below mine.  "I was trying to pull myself up with limited success, when a man appeared in the balcony. I thought that my life was saved, but the freak started ramming on my fingers. I cried at him to stop, which he did, but only to return with a freaking hammer and flatten my poor fingers. I had to let go, but by some miracle I managed to land in some bushes, crippled but alive. Before I even had time to think how lucky I was, I saw a mighty refrigerator coming straight at me and that was the end of it."  St. Peter feels even more sorry for the man and opens the gates to let him in. He then approaches the third man.  "It's a rather funny story," said the man. "So I was sitting naked inside a refrigerator..."

1	So there was this guy from Bulgaria who drove trains for a living  He loved his job. Driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. He loved to make the train go as fast as possible. Unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. He made it out, but a single person died. Well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. He was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. When the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. After eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. The man was perfectly fine.     Well, at the time, there was an old Bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. Somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. Having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. Once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. The trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. For his final meal, the man requested two bananas. After eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. The switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.    Well, this of course meant that he was free to go. And once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. To what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. And so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. On the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.   "You know what? No," said the executioner.    "I've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. I'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."      Well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. The switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. The executioner was speechless.      The man looked at the executioner and said, "Oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. I'm just a bad conductor."
2	A priest, doctor, and engineer are golfing They are stuck behind a really slow group of golfers. The engineer fumes, “What’s with those guys? We must have been waiting for fifteen minutes!”  The doctor chimes in, “I don’t know, but I’ve never seen such inept golf!”  The  priest says, “Here comes the greenkeeper. Let’s have a word with him.” He says, “Hey Bob, what’s wrong with that group ahead of us? They’re rather slow, aren’t they?”  The  greenkeeper replies, “Oh, yes. That’s a group of blind firemen. They  lost their sight saving our clubhouse from a fire last year, so we  always let them play for free anytime!.”  The group falls silent for a moment. The priest says, “That’s so sad. I think I will say a special prayer for them tonight.”  The doctor says, “I’m going to contact the ophthalmologist community and see if there’s anything there can be done for them.”  The engineer says, “Why can’t they play at night?”

"Well, take his penis away for a month!", she goes. God tells her that that won't be fair to the monkey alone. "So take the dicks of all the animals for a month", she tells God. God agrees and an announcement is made that all wild animals in the forest need to deposit their dicks with God for a month. So, the males line up to the God and submit their dicks and the God gives them a receipt in return so that they can claim their instruments back when the moratorium is over.  The monkey wife is very pleased with herself over all this business, but is puzzled to see the monkey returning very happily from the deposit line.  "Well, you won't be poking me for a month now, so what are you grinning about?", she asks.  "Count those days away, bitch! I got the receipt for the elephant's dick."

St. Peter comes along and handcuffs him to the ugliest woman in all the world and says, "Now you must stay handcuffed for all eternity." The other two see this and do their best to avoid the ducks. The second guy goes months and months without stepping on any duck. Then one morning he wakes up and as he is getting out of bed he steps on two ducks. St. Peter comes over and handcuffs him to the most atrocious looking and smelling woman and says, "Now you must stay handcuffed to each other for all eternity." Now the third guy goes years and years and doesn't step on any ducks in all that time. Then one day St. Peter comes along and handcuffs him to the most beautiful woman he as ever seen. St. Peter says, "Now you must stay handcuffed to each other for all eternity." The guy happily says, "Oh my God, what have I done to deserve this?!" And the woman says, "I don't know what you did, but I stepped on a duck."

1	The great detective Herlock Sholmes was hired to investigate the disappearance of one of the most important political figures in the nation. He was quickly briefed on the current situation: at two in the morning, a young woman named Andrea had been captured by an unknown party. Now normally, a kidnapping wouldn’t be something to call in the great Herlock Sholmes for, but Andrea was a special case.  In the nation of Modgasia, the government consisted of four ruling councilmembers, called Houses: the House of Wisdom, the House of Courage, the House of Justice, and the House of Power. Together, these Houses formed the Cell, the central ruling government of the nation. Andrea was the daughter of Lady Lillian Isda, the current House of Power, considered to be the House with the greatest authority – and Lady Isda had recently fallen ill.  There were several suspects presented to Herlock Sholmes as he listened to the case. First, but least likely, was Lady Isda, who some said feared the loss of power – but she loved her daughter too much to have done something like that. Second was the Wisdom House, Connor Fucius, who disliked the Isda family, but lacked the resources to pull off a kidnapping like this one.  Finally, and most likely, was the Justice House, Justin Iceberg, who was in charge of the secret police force the Modgasia Advanced Intelligence, or Mai for short. The Mai operated independently under Justin’s supervision and did whatever he told them to, no questions asked. On top of that, the young Justice House was Andrea’s ex-boyfriend, rumored to have broken up on bad terms, and strongly opposed all of her political stances.  Detective Sholmes sat in his armchair, his ever-present tabby cat Watson curled on his lap as he listened to the investigative report. Lady Isda sat bawling across from him, a mountain of tissues already heaped besides her.  “Hmmm…” was all the detective said, after a few minutes of contemplation.  “Well? Have you figured out anything?” The Lady cried out as she grabbed more tissues.  Herlock Sholmes stroked his pussy. “Yes. You see, it’s Biology, my dear Watson.”  “Biology?!” Lillian Isda cried out.  Herlock Sholmes nodded and looked up.  “The Mai took Andrea Isda, Power House of the Cell.”

2	A woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, "I played on my college's golf team. I was pretty good. Mind if I join you next week?" No one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot… Finally, one man says, "Okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m."  He figures the early tee-time will discourage her.  The woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.  They roll their eyes, but say, "Okay."  She's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.  She's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.  They congratulate her and invite her back the next week.  She smiles, and says, "I'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45."  The next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.  Only this time, she plays left-handed.  The three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.  They're totally amazed.  They can't figure her out.  She's very pleasant and a gracious winner.  They invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.  The third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.  This week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.  The men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.  However, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.  This woman is a riddle no one can figure out.  They have a couple of beers in the Clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, "How do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?"  The lady blushes, and grins. "When my dad taught me to play golf, I learned that I was ambidextrous." she replies. "I like to switch back and forth."  "When I got married after college, I discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. From then on, I developed a silly habit. Right before I leave in the morning for golf practice, I pull the covers off him. If his willie points to the right, I golf right-handed; if it points to the left, I golf left-handed."  The guys think this is hysterical.  Astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, "What if it's pointing straight up?"  She says, "Then, I'm fifteen minutes late."

"We're not fucking down here!“, the husband yells back. After some more time passes, the tour guide once again looks down and yells" Stop fucking down there!"  Once again, the husband denies any fucking. This continues for a while until it is night and the husband climbs up the tree.  The tour guide seduces the wife and begins to have sex with her once they are alone.  Meanwhile, the husband stretched out on the tree and narrows his eyes at them. "Hey!" he thinks, "that son of a bitch was right! It really does look like they're fucking down there!"

I’ve never had to evict a dog in the middle of the night for being drunk and disorderly. And I’ve never had a dog run out on a hotel bill. Yes, indeed, your dog is welcome at my hotel. And, if your dog will vouch for you, you re welcome to stay here, too.”

If he gets angry, he'll kill us both. Be strong, honey. I love you!"  His wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear.

2	Two Priests and Two Nuns have dinner with His Holiness, the Pope.     Two priests are fishing on lake outside of Rome. It's a beautiful day, the sun is light, and the water is smooth. Suddenly the first priests fishing rod bends alarmingly; he has hooked a huge fish! It's a struggle but he managed to reel it in. It's a beautiful rainbow coloured fish and big enough to feed a family.  "Would you look at the size of that *Fucker*!" he exclaims, startling the second priest.  "Hey, you can't talk like that; you're a man of the cloth. I'm a man of the cloth!" Says the second priest, scandalised.  The first priest raises his hands in a calming gesture "It's ok my good fellow, that's the fish's name. It's an *Italian Fucker Fish*."  After breathing a sigh of relief, the second priest is able to appreciate the fish a bit more. "Why don't we cook it for our dinner with the His Holiness the Pope tonight" he says. The first priest agrees, and they go their separate ways, the first priest to return their boat and the second to deliver the fish into the Vatican.  Priest number two lobs up at the convent and knocks at the door, a sister answers and he proudly shows her the fish. "Could the mother superior cook this *Fucker* for our dinner with His Holiness the Pope?" He asks. Scandalising the poor sister.  "You can't talk like that!" she says "You're a man of the cloth. I'm a woman of the cloth".  "Fret not, dear sister" the priest says "that is the fish's name. It's an *Italian Fucker Fish*."  Mollified the nun agrees to prepare the fish for the mother superior to cook. She scales and guts the fish and then calls on the mother superior. "Mother, I have prepared this *Fucker* so that you may cook it for our dinner tonight with His Holiness the Pope".  Mum superior nearly has a heart attack. "My child" she shrieks "We are women of the cloth. You cannot use such language!"  The nun placates the mother by explaining that the fish is an *Italian Fucker Fish*. And, so assured, she agrees to cook the fish for their dinner with His Holiness.  Later that night both Priests, the Nun and the Mother Superior are at dinner with His Holiness the Pope. They remove the silver cover from their meal and serve the fish. The Pope takes a few bites and a sip of wine and states "This fish is fantastic, practically divine"  "I caught the *Fucker*." Says the first priest.  "Well I brought the *Fucker* into the city." Says the second.  "I scaled and gutted the *Fucker*." Says the nun.  "And I cooked the *Fucker*." Says the mother superior.  His Holiness takes a look around the table, takes another sip of his wine and says "You know what? ***You cunts are alright!"***

He put up a sign that said “Dr. Geezer’s clinic: Get your treatment for $500, if not cured, get back $1000.”  Dr. Young, who was positive that this old geezer didn’t know beans about medicine, thought this would be a great opportunity to win $1000.  He went to Dr. Geezer’s clinic and says, “Dr. Geezer, I have lost all taste in my mouth.  Can you please help me?”  Dr. Geezer calls out, “Nurse, please bring medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in Dr. Young’s mouth.”  Dr. Young yells, “Aaagh!  This is gasoline!”  Dr. Geezer replies, “Congratulations!  You’ve got your taste back, that will be $500.”  Dr. Young gets annoyed and returns a couple days later with another plan to recover his money.  He enters the clinic and says, “I have lost my memory, I cannot remember anything.”  Dr. Geezer calls out, “Nurse, please bring medicine from box 22 and put 3 drops in Dr. Young’s mouth.”  Dr. Young yells, “Oh no you don’t, that’s gasoline!”  Dr. Geezer replies, “Congratulations, you’ve got your memory back, that will be $500.”  Dr. Young, angry after losing $1000, comes back after several more days.  He enters the clinic and says, “My eyesight has become weak, I cannot see anything!”  Dr. Geezer replies, “Well, I don’t have any medicine for that, so here’s your $1000 back,” and hands Dr. Young a $10 bill.  Dr. Young quickly yells, “Hey, this is only $10!”  Dr. Geezer replies, “Congratulations, you’ve got your vision back, that will be $500.”

1	It took 5 years to "get" this joke. It's 1983 in the Midwest. It's 6th grade and I hear the following joke.  A man takes his seat on a TWA flight when he sees the hottest, sexiest stewardess approach him with a wink and a smile.   She says "Sir, would you like some of our famous TWA coffee this morning?"  He said "No, but I sure would like some of your TWA tea!"  Everyone busts out laughing and I'm wondering why hot breakfast beverages are funny. But I laugh anyway.  Five years later. I'm talking with this girl across the street from me that I had a multi-year crush on. In the course of conversation I mention this joke I had heard and never understood. I'm in 11th grade by now. You'd think I would have known the word "twat".   I didn't have to explain it to her. In retrospect, that was a pretty good joke for 6th grade.  True story. All of it.

1	I used to work as a carpenter's apprentice Before I opened my own business I was an apprentice for one Walter Harrington, a carpenter of some renown. The old man was a master at his craft, and we routinely had orders from ultra-rich clients looking to have extra-fancy furniture custom made to their specifications.  One day Walt decides that I'm ready to do a complete project on my own, all the way from planning to finished product. So he sends me to the front desk with instructions to take the order from the next client to come in, and that he won't intervene unless I find that I'm in over my head and explicitly ask for help.  So eventually this lady walks through the door, and she has this very distinctive appearance, long curly hair dyed in all the colors of the rainbow under a brown cowboy's hat, leather boots over skin-tight jeans, and a flannel shirt. Absolutely stunning. And she turns to me and says:  "I'm opening an exclusive pub that will cater to a very specific clientele: only pairs, triplets, and so on of identical twin sisters, and only if they're all lesbians. I have almost everything I need, save for the countertop itself. I need it to be this long and this wide (it's been a few years, I have forgotten the exact measurements - OP), at least 1.5 inch thick, with the edges carved Ogee over Half Bullnose, and I want it made out of..." She took a moment to consider, looking at our selection of sample boards, "This gorgeous red wood. Can you make that for me?"  "Just a moment ma'am, I need to check." Of course I wanted to say yes, but I wasn't sure that the type of wood she'd chosen would be safe to use in an establishment that serves food and drink. So I turned around and asked my boss:  "Walt, would yew do for a cloned dyke bar?"

Naturally, they're both shocked.  "If that isn't weird enough..." says the woman. "I noticed you're reading Mark Twain. I was a communications major in university and I actually wrote my thesis on Mark Twain and how he used satire as a lens to comment on current events of the time, comparing him to satirical news sources of today. He's my favorite author."  Now the man is really taken aback, "Get out of here! I was an English major in university! I specialized in 19th century American literature and this is like my fourth or fifth time reading Tom Sawyer, I absolutely love Mark Twain."  They both can't believe it...this has got to be a match made in heaven.  "Ok..." the woman says. "Well, buckle up because here's the icing on the cake. I noticed you're eating a prune. Prunes are my absolute favorite fruit. When I was a kid, my grandfather lived on a farm. He had an orchard that mainly grew apples and some lemons, but he knew how much my sister and I loved prunes so he kept a couple of plum trees. Every year at the end of the summer, we'd go up and harvest the plums with him. He'd dry them and by the time we'd go back to his place for Thanksgiving he'd always have those prunes saved just for us. They're my favorite fruit!

"Actually," said the 80-year-old, “Eighty is the worst age of all." "Do you have trouble peeing, too?" asked the 60-year-old. "No, I pee every morning at 6:00. I pee like a racehorse on a flat rock; no problem at all." "So, do you have a problem with your bowel movement?" asked the 70-year-old man. "No, I have one every morning at 6:30." Exasperated, they both ask: "You pee every morning at 6:00 and crap every morning at 6:30. So what's so bad about being 80?"  "I don’t wake up until 7:00."

1	A man suffered from a chronic hellish headache He went to see a doctor who, after the usual exams, said:  - My friend, I have good and bad news. The good thing is that I can cure you of this headache forever.  The bad news is that to do that I'll have to castrate you! Your testicles are pressing on your spine, and that pressure causes a hellish headache. To alleviate suffering I need to remove them.  The man was in shock and fell into a depression. He spent days meditating about the surgery. He had no choice but to submit to the scalpel's will. When he left the hospital, for the first time after 20 years he no longer had a headache. However, he realized that an important part of himself was gone. As he walked the streets he noticed that he was a different man, but that he could have a new beginning. He spotted a designer men's clothing store.  - "This is what I need," he said to himself.  - I want a new suit, he asked the salesman.  The tailor, of advanced age, took a look, and said:  - Let's see ... it's a long 44.  The man laughed:  - That's right, how did you know ???  - I have been in the business for over 60 years, replied the tailor.  He tried on the suit, which suited him very well. While admiring himself in the mirror, the tailor asked:  - How about a new shirt ???  He thought for a few moments:  - Sure !!!  The tailor looked and said:  - Sleeve size 34, and neck size16.  And he was amazed:  - Exactly, that's right, how could you guess ???  - "I have been in the business for over sixty years," he said.  He tried on the shirt and it was perfect. As he walked through the store, the tailor suggested to him:  - How about a new underwear ???  - Of course!!!  The tailor looked at his hips, and said:  - Let's see ... I think it's 36.  The man laughed:   - This time, I got you!  I have been wearing size 34 since I was 18 years old.  The tailor shook his head in disapproval:  - You can't wear 34. If you do, I'll press your testicles against your spine, and that pressure will definitely give you a hell of a headache.

1	Billy's birthday gift Little Billy just turned 8. His parents went all out for the party. They rented a bounce house. The cake was three layers. They even hired the best clown in the state. All of Billy's friends from school were there, even some of the older cool kids made it. At the end of the party, when everyone left, Billy's father gave him one last gift It was wrapped up in a large box. Billy opened the box up and inside was a slightly smaller box. Written on the box was "Open me on your 80th birthday." Billy's dad, who has a big grin on his face, said "I guess you'll just have to wait." Later that night, Billy barely got any sleep as he pondered whether or not to open the box anyway. It took a great amount of restraint, but he decided not to open the box.  Five years later, Billy was celebrating his 13th birthday. He'd reached a milestone and that year had been quite eventful. He was growing up, noticing girls. His parents got divorced. It was a mutual decision, and they both told him that it wasn't his fault. His mother, however, still felt the need to over-compensate on his birthday. She managed to reserve Billy's favorite arcade for him and his friends. Overall, he had a great day, but later that night, he remembered his dad's gift. He had it stashed away in the closet. He pulled the box out to open it up, but looked at those words on the box that said "Open me on your 80th birthday". Billy contemplated opening the box up anyway. He figured he waited long enough, but ultimately, he chose not to open the box, and put it back in the closet.  Another five years passed, and Billy was turning 18. This year we also eventful. His parents reconciled. He had a girlfriend. He was starting college after the summer. He didn't need anything this year, and yet his parents surprised him with a brand new car. He was as happy as can be. Still in the corner of his mind, however, was the gift he received from his father ten years ago. Later that year, when he was packing things up for college, he came across the box that read "Open me on your 80th birthday." Surely it would be okay enough to open now, wouldn't it?" Billy held the box in his hands for a good five minutes before deciding to pack it away without opening it.  Many years passed, and Billy, who was now going by Will, was turning 36. He got married, started a family and finally finished school, earning his PhD. Alas, his father passed away that same year. So it wasn't all good news. Will couldn't help but think about that box. He held onto it all these years. Still written on the box was "Open me on your 80th birthday." His father passed. He could open the box now, right?" In the end, he couldn't bring himself to do it. He wanted to respect his father's wishes.  Nearly 50 years passed, and Will had lived quite a life. After earning his doctorate, he began teaching at the same ivy league school here graduated from. His children grew up, followed in his footsteps and had kids of their own. He'd lived a long life. His wife, however, passed the previous year. And Will knew he wouldn't last much longer. His 80th birthday arrived. And even in his advanced age, he never forgot spot the box his father gave him decades ago. He kept it so long. Every birthday was a constant reminder. He wanted to know what was inside. But the very movement he grabbed the box, he became overwhelmed with excitement and suffered a heart attack before he could even open the box.  I bet you're thinking that's where the story ends, right? Well it isn't. Minutes later, the housekeeper found Will on the ground with the box in his hands. She was going to immediately call an ambulance, but here curiosity got the best of her. Written on the box was "Open me on your 80th birthday." She removed the lid from the box. Inside, bound but a paper clip, was eight $1 bills and a small note, which the housekeeper read aloud to herself.  "I knew you wouldn't be able to wait. Happy 8th birthday, Billy."

1	When curiosity gets the better of you A guy sits at a bar in a skyscraper restaurant high above the city. He slams a shot of tequila, goes over to the window and jumps out.  The guy sitting next to him can’t believe what he just saw. He’s more surprised when, 10 minutes later, the same guy walks back into the bar and sits down next to him.  The astonished onlooker asks, “How did you do that? I just saw you jump out the window, and we’re hundreds of feet above the ground!”  The jumper responds by slurring, “Well, I don’t get it either. I slam a shot of tequila, and when I jump out the window, the tequila makes me slow down right before I hit the ground. Watch.” He takes a shot, goes to the window and jumps out.  The other guy runs to the window and watches as the guy falls to just above the sidewalk, slows down and lands softly on his feet. A few minutes later, the jumper walks back into the bar.  The other guy has to try it, too, so he orders a shot of tequila. He slams it and jumps out the window. As he reaches the bottom, he doesn’t slow down at all. SPLAT!  The first guy orders another shot of tequila. The bartender shakes his head. “You’re really an a**hole when you’re drunk, Superman.”

The boy went to his room, got a stack of refill and a pen and began writing: 'Dear Baby Jesus, I've been good all year, can you please give me a bike for Christmas.'  Then he looked at it and thought maybe that wasn't entirely true, so he tried again.  'Dear Baby Jesus, I've been good for the past week, can you please give me a bike for Christmas.'  Then he looked at it again and still wasn't sure if that was true, so he tried yet again.  'Dear Baby Jesus, if you give me a bike, I'll be good all year.'  But even then that seemed too hard, so he took a walk outside to think about it.  As he was walking, he saw his neighbour's statue of Mother Mary. The boy hopped over the fence, tucked it under his shoulder and ran home to hide it.  Then wrote his letter again.  'Dear Baby Jesus, if you ever want to see your mother again, give me a bike.'

1	Interview with the Pope and a Rabbi. I am a reporter for a major monthly publication. Generally I write human interest articles. Last year I was given the privilege and granted an interview with the Pope.  Upon entering the Pope's office I was greeted warmly with a handshake and a hug. The pope and I had an amazing conversation that lasted approximately 30 minutes. During the entire time I was interviewing the pope, my eyes kept glancing at a phone set into a nook on the wall. The phone appeared to be made of solid gold. The phone seems so out of place in that office that I continue to stare at it, wondering what that phone was, and where the other end went to.  At the end of the interview I asked the Pope, "Your Holiness, I couldn't help but look at that phone on the wall, and wondering, where does it go?"  In response the pope raised his eyes and pointed skyward. "Excuse me your holiness, are you saying that that phone goes straight up to God?" "Yes my son that's exactly right." The Pope replied.  "Well, your Holiness this may sound rash but do you think there's any possibility that I might speak to him?" "Why yes my son, you may. I will leave you alone for 10 or so minutes so that you may speak with him. "The pope replied.  After leaving the room I picked up the phone, and had the most amazing conversation of my life with you know who. After leaving the office I found the pope was in the outer office waiting for me to finish.  "Your Holiness, that was a most amazing and life-changing event for me. Is there anything I could do to repay this kindness and privilege that you have granted me?"  "Well my son, you could leave a donation, maybe $5,000 would be enough."  The Pope replied. Pulling out my checkbook I eagerly signed the check for a $5,000 donation to the church.   Fast forward to a couple of weeks ago. This time I was sent to Israel to do an interview with the chief Rabbi of Jerusalem.  The interview went very much like the interview with the Pope I had the year earlier. However, once again when I went into his office, I saw an identical phone in a niche on the wall behind the Rabbi.  Once again at the end of the interview I asked the Rabbi, "Rabbi excuse me but I have to ask you this question, last year I was in Rome and had an opportunity to interview the Pope. He had a similar phone on the wall and granted me the incredible privilege to speak to God on his phone. Do you think it might be possible that I may use your phone to once again speak to him.?"  "Yes my son, you may use my phone and speak to him if you wish." The Rabbi responded. Once again I was left alone for approximately 20 minutes to speak with God.  At the end of the conversation I left the Rabbi's office and entered his secretary's office, where the Rabbi was waiting for me to finish.  Speaking to the Rabbi before I left I said to him, "Rabbi, last year when I was with the Pope he requested that I make a donation to the church for the privilege of using his phone. I would be more than willing to make a donation to you for the same privilege. How much should I write the check for?" I asked.  "Well my son, $5 would be enough to cover the cost." The Rabbi responded. "$5 ?, Last year when I interviewed the Pope, he asked for a donation of $5,000. Why are you only asking for $5 ?" I inquired.  "Well you see my son, from here it's a local call."

Very diligently, Kathleen did as she was asked. Heidi pushed and pushed, and after a little while Connor was born. The paramedic lifted him by his little feet and spanked him on his bottom. Connor began to cry.  The paramedic then thanked Kathleen for her help and asked the wide-eyed 3-year old what she thought about what she had just witnessed. Kathleen quickly responded, "He shouldn't have crawled in there in the first place, smack his ass again."

You see, when Dad doesn't make any bread, John makes it for him." The little one stares at him wide eyed and asks "is it as good as yours?" With a small grin he replies "No, mine is better!" And off he went to get the bread.   Arriving at their next stop, the little one again queries where they are. "Why this is Ted's Liquor store, youngest. You see, when Dad doesn't make any beer, Ted makes it for him."   The little one stares at him, thinking hard, and asks "is it as good as yours?"  With a bigger grin he replies "no, mine is better!" and off he went to get some beer.  At their final stop, the butcher's shop, the little one thinks the world makes a lot more sense now. "So then Dad..." his smallest child begins, and looks at him expectantly.   "Yes that's right little one. This is Tom the Butcher. And when Dad hasn't made any sausages...." he trails off.  "... Tom makes them for you?" She asks hesitantly.  "Yes that's right! You are a smart one!" He exclaimed. "And yours are better!!" She shouts. Beaming with pride he says "Exactly!" And away he goes to collect some sausages from Tom.   On the road home they pass the postal truck coming the other way. "Hey Dad!" Exclaimed the little one. "It's Pete the Postman!"   "Yes that's right" said the farmer, but  sensing what comes next he quickly continued "but we need Pete, your Dad is a farmer and can do a lot of things but I can't  do what Pete does."   "Oh yes!" she replied, "Mum says so too!"

Just one thing - get them all in one place and make sure he can't escape - or look out! He'll fuck anything he can! I'll bring him by tomorrow morning."

"I suppose. Got no choice. Alright. Let's do it."  Bill swings the barn door open and the rooster starts going crazy in his cage. Joe opens the cage and screams: "Shut the door now!"  They slam the barn shut and you could hear the rooster fucking every hen repeatedly. But after a while, they heard a crash and then .. deafening silence.

They run behind the barn and see Bill's flock of sheep passed out from being fucked by Joe's roster. Then, over the hills - his cows were also molested. Further down - his goats too! That rooster was insatiable!  Finally, they see the rooster passed out in the middle of the field - looking like he's dying. There are even vultures circling above him. His eyes are rolled back, tongue sticking out, talons up.   Joe: "Petey! Oh Petey! I just knew it! I knew you'd fuck yourself to death!"  Petey: winks and brings his wing to his beak. "Shhhhhhhh!" his eyes darting towards the circling vultures, he whispers: "Go away. They're about to land"

So the man asks the bartender, “What’s the deal with that jar?”  The bartender replies, “That’s our challenge jar. You put $100 in and if you can complete the challenges you get all the money in the jar.”  Intrigued, the man asks what the challenges are.   The bartender says, “Well, first you have to eat a plate of 5 rotten eggs. Second, there is a bear in the basement that has an abscess tooth. You’ll have to pull it. And finally, there’s a 90 year old lady upstairs who has never had an orgasm. You have to give her one.”  The man replies, “Honestly, I was out at the rotten eggs. Thanks though.”  So the man sits down and has a drink. Then another. Then another. And before long, he’s had enough liquid courage to tell the bartender, “You know what? Screw it, I’ll go for it.”  So he places his $100 in the jar and the bartender brings out the eggs. They smell awful and taste even worse, but the man is drunk and there’s gotta be thousands in that jar, so he chokes them down.   “Great,” says the bartender. “The bear is downstairs. Good luck.”   So the man goes to the basement. Everyone in the bar gathers at the door to hear what’s happening. It’s quiet at first, and the suddenly there’s a huge commotion. The bear is roaring, the man is screaming, glass is smashing, walls are breaking. It’s pandemonium down there.   After 10 minutes, the man opens the basement door. He’s covered in blood and his clothes are torn to shreds, but he’s still standing.   The bartender asks him, “Are you okay?”  “Yeah,” the man replies. “Now where’s that old lady with the bad tooth?”

1	I was wakened at 3am by a crashing noise... I went down the stairs, cricket bat in hand, only to come face to face with an intruder stepping through my front door. He was armed with a crowbar but a swift crack of the willow round his head dropped him and he was spark out for enough time for me to grab a short length of rope. After hog-tying him in the hallway I went in the kitchen and made myself a cup of Horlicks. The bloke was conscious again when I returned. I stepped over him and began climbing the stairs. He said “Wait, aren’t you gonna call the cops?”  I turned and replied “Why would I do that? Nobody knows you’re here” and continued back up to bed.   Anyway enough of that nonsense, I’m having a big barbecue tomorrow afternoon, all are welcome.
1	A teenage boy had just passed his driving test ... and asked his father as to when they could discuss his use of the car.  His father said he'd make a deal with his son, "You bring your grades up from a C to a B average, study your Bible a little and get your hair cut. Then we'll talk about the car" The boy thought about that for a moment, decided he'd settle for the offer and they agreed on it.  After about six weeks his father said, "Son, you've brought your grades up and I've observed that you have been studying your Bible, but I'm disappointed you haven't had your hair cut."  The boy said, "You know, Dad, I've been thinking about that, and I've noticed in my studies of the Bible that Samson had long hair, John the Baptist had long hair, Moses had long hair, and there's even strong evidence that Jesus had long hair.”  The father responded, "Did you also notice that they all walked everywhere they went?"

1	A cop pulls over a car going 45 mph down the highway. As he walks up to the drivers side window he notices that it is a little old lady driving the vehicle with her friend in the passenger seat. When the old lady rolls down her window, the cop asks why she was driving so slow. The old lady simple replied that she was going the speed limit and gestured to the sign on the side wall of the highway. The cop informs the driver that the sign is merely the number of the highway. It is about this time that he noticed that the passenger seemed distressed. When he asked the driver she told him that her friend will be fine. She then informed the officer that they had just gotten off Highway 180 so she was probably a bit shakey.

Curious, he walks up to group and asks someone what's happening.   "Every Friday we get together and tell jokes. We've got some good ones. Check it out."  An inmate steps into the circle and says, "17."  The group erupts in laughter.   Gary doesn't get it. He asks what's so funny about 17.   "Well we've been telling the same jokes for so long, we've just started numbering them to save time."  Another inmate steps in and can barely hold his laughter. "290."  A couple of the guys in the group are rolling around with tears in their eyes. Another is vomitting from laughing so hard. One of them points to Gary. "Hey new guy, come tell us a joke."  Gary nervously steps into the circle and says "61". Nobody laughs.   "Try again new guy! You can do it!" He hears from somewhere in the crowd.  With a bit more confidence, Gary yells out "277!!"  Silence. He doesn't understand. He goes to the guy who invited him in. "Why didn't anybody laugh?"  He puts his hand on Gary's shoulder. "Sorry, man. Some people just can't tell jokes."

1	A man was driving around back roads and gets lost  The man stopped at a farm to get directions. As he was talking to the farmer he noticed a pig with a wooden leg. “How did that pig lose his leg?” he asked the farmer. “Well”, said the farmer, “that’s a very special pig. One night not too long ago we had a fire start in the barn, and that pig squealed so loud and long that he woke everyone, and by the time we got there he had herded all the other animals out of the barn. Saved them all.” “And that was when he hurt his leg?” The man asked.  “Nope, he pulled through that just fine.” said the farmer. “Though a while later, I was back in the woods when a bear attacked me. Well, sir, that pig was nearby and he came running and rammed that bear from behind and then chased him off. He saved me for sure.” “Wow! So the bear injured his leg then?” Said the man.  “No. He came away without a scratch. Though a few days later, my tractor turned over in a ditch and I was knocked unconscious. Well, that pig dove into the ditch and pulled me out before I got cut up in the machinery.”  “Ahh! So his leg got caught under the tractor?” asked the man.  “Noooo. We both walked away from that one.” says the farmer. “So how did he get the wooden leg?” asked the man.  “Well”, the farmer replied, “A pig like that is special, you wouldn’t want to eat him, not all at once.”

After taking some time to size Jim up and decide that he can trust him, Carl tells Jim about his plan to escape. “You see," Carl says "for the first 5 years I was inside, I trained my digestive system to follow my command. Now I can eat something and it comes out broken down into it's components.”  Jim is skeptical, but intrigued.  Carl continues, "For the last five years, I've been swallowing pieces off my uniform. It's perfect, because the guards just think it's rats chewing on it.”  So Jim asks "Well, what does that have to do with me? How can I help?"  Carl says, "Well, the pieces of fabric come out as individual strands. I figure by this time next year, we'll have enough to fashion enough rope to get over the wall. I just need you to tie the strands into rope".  Jim, disgusted, says "You have got to be kidding me!"  Carl says "No. I shit. You knot.”

1	With age, you gain wisdom. A young man shopping in a supermarket noticed a little old lady following him around.  If he stopped, she stopped. She even kept staring at him.  She finally overtook him at the check out and she turned to him and said, "I hope I haven't made you feel ill at ease. It's just that you look so much like my late son."  The man answered, "It's okay ma'am."  She said, "I know it sounds silly, but if you would just say 'Goodbye Mom' as I leave the store, it would make me feel quite happy."  The man complied, and as the little old lady was leaving the store, he called out, "GOOD BYE MOM!"  The lady waved and smiled back at him.  Pleased that he had brought a little sunshine in someone's life, he proceeded to pay for his groceries at the check out.  "That comes to 1211.85$, sir.", said the clerk.  The man was perplexed. He said, "How is that possible, I only bought five items, and the tally was less than 200$!"  The clerk replied, "Yeah, but your mother said, that you would be paying for her things too."  And I bet you thought this would turn out to be a tearjerker!

1	Two priests decided to go to Hawaii on vacation. They were determined to make this a real vacation by not wearing anything that would identify them as clergy.   As soon as the plane landed they headed for a store and bought some really outrageous shorts, shirts, sandals, sunglasses, etc.   The next morning they went to the beach dressed in their 'tourist' garb. They were sitting on beach chairs, enjoying a drink, the sunshine and the scenery when a 'drop dead gorgeous' blonde in a topless bikini came walking straight towards them.   They couldn't help but stare.   As the blonde passed them she smiled and said 'Good Morning Father, Good Morning Father,' nodding and addressing each of them individually, then she passed on by.   They were both stunned.   How in the world did she know they were priests?   So the next day, they went back to the store and bought even more outrageous outfits. These were so loud you could hear them before you even saw them! Once again, in their new attire, they settled down in their chairs to enjoy the sunshine, after a little while, the same gorgeous blonde, wearing a different coloured topless bikini, taking her sweet time, came walking toward them.   Again she nodded at each of them, said 'Good morning Father, Good morning Father,' and started to walk away.   One of the priests couldn't stand it any longer and said, 'Just a minute, young lady.' 'Yes, Father?'   'We are priests and proud of it, but I have to know, how in the world do you know we are priests, dressed as we are?' She replied, 'Father, it's me, Sister Kathleen.'

2	A brilliant scientist successfully creates a lifelike deer cyborg. Dr. Holmes, after many years of biotechnological research, finally succeeded in his secret project, using funds diverted from his research grant. Because the project needed to be kept off the records, Dr. Holmes kept the deer at home.  The cyborg would grow and develop just as a normal fawn would, but it would have the mental capacity of a human being. Dr. Holmes instantly took a liking to the young deer, who he considered to be the son he had never had. He nurtured it tenderly and provided the fawn with all he desired.   Once the deer had begun to mature, Dr. Holmes decided it was time to begin homeschooling the young buck. He taught him to read, write, and speak. Next, he taught him basic arithmetic. Of course, Dr. Holmes decided to teach him science as well.   They started with geology. Unlike the other subjects, the deer struggled from the get-go, failing to grasp any of the basic concepts. One day, the doctor announced a pop quiz. He would hold up a picture of a rock, and the deer would have to identify it. The first rock was a light tan rock.   “Is it an igneous rock?” asked the young buck.  The doctor shook his head.   “Hmm, metamorphic?” the deer tried again.  The doctor shook his head once more. Dr. Holmes then looked at his creation, sighed, and said disappointingly, “It’s sedimentary, my deer bot son.”

1	Three guys Three guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp. One of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a Genie. It booms "You have finally freed me after all these years, so I'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."  The first guy immediately blurts out "I want a billion dollars." POOF, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 The second man thinks for a bit, then says "I want to be the richest man alive." POOF, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. The third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says "I want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life." POOF, his arm starts rotating.  The Genie tells them it's time for their second wish. First guy says: "I want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth." POOF, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. Second guy says "I want to be good-looking and charismatic, so I can have every girl I want." POOF, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. Third guy says "I want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until I die." POOF, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.  The genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. First guy does, and after a while says "I never want to become sick or injured, I want to stay healthy until I die." POOF, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. Second guy says "I never want to grow old. I want to stay 29 forever." POOF, he looks younger already. Third guy smiles triumphantly and says "My last wish is for my head to nod back and forth." POOF, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. The genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.  Many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. First guy is ecstatic: "I've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. My wife is a freak in the sheets, and I've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years." Second guy smiles and says "Well, I built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, I'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. I haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed." Third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:  "Guys, I think I fucked up."

'  The mother (who couldn't think of an answer) told her son to ask the pretty flight attendant.   So the boy dutifully asked the flight attendant, 'If dogs have baby dogs and cats have baby cats, why don't planes have baby planes?'   The flight attendant responded, 'Did your mother tell you to ask me that?'

2	A man escapes from prison where he has been for 15 years.  He breaks into a house to look for money and guns, and finds a young couple in bed. He orders the guy out of bed and ties him to a chair. He ties the girl to the bed and he gets on top of her, kisses her neck, and then gets up and goes into the bathroom. While he's in there, the husband tells his wife, "Listen, this guy is an escaped convict, look at his clothes! He probably spent lots of time in jail and hasn't seen a woman in years. I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain, do whatever he tells you. Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is probably very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us. Be strong, honey. I love you." His wife responds, "He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me he was gay, thought you were cute, and asked me if we had any Vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you, too!" -

1	A struggling rock band... A struggling indies band from Brooklyn, The Spoonerists, was in the process of recording their debut album. The artistic sentiment of the group led them to use ambient sounds from nature in their arrangements. One of the members of the band took it upon himself to go out in to the field and make recordings, including one recording of a herd of cattle at a farm in upstate New York, with permission from the farmer, Lance R. Boo.  The resulting album was a huge success, and the critics were especially enamored of the sound that the cattle provided, saying that the sound was groundbreaking, and some calling it the best collaboration of the century. In the wake of this success, the band began to book their first national tour.  The success of the album drew throngs of fans to their concerts, but after the first few shows, fans and critics were uniformly expressing deep disappointment that the sounds of the herd of cattle was notably absent. The band's manager suggested that the play a recording of the herd as a backing track. This seemed to work at first, but after a few more shows, the fans and critics still complained that they had come to see the band with the groundbreaking sound, and were again disappointed with the rote, prerecorded sound of cattle, and ticket sales dropped significantly.  The band's manager then had another idea. He went back to upstate New York and asked farmer Boo if they could rent his cows to use on stage for the rest of the tour. Farmer Boo said no. After several more critically panned concerts, the manager went back to Boo, and pleaded with him to let them use the cattle, even offering twice the money he had initially offered.  Farmer Boo thought for a minute, then said, "You know, it's been a lonely life here since my wife died, and she was never much company to me anyway. I think I'd be inclined to let you use my cows in exchange for something other than money."  The manager looked at him nervously, and reluctantly asked, "What else can I offer you, Farmer Boo?"  Boo replied, "I like the look of you, son. I think If you'd spend a night of passion with me, I suppose Id be obligated to give you the cattle in return."  The manager was shocked, said "no" immediately, and left the farmhouse as quickly as he could.  When the manager told the band the terms of Boo's deal, they became incensed, and told him he wasn't being a team player. The band was hemorrhaging money, their ticket sales were dismal, and the critics continued to revile their live sound. They pleaded with the manager to go back to Farmer Boo, and give him whatever he wanted in exchange for the herd of cattle.  So, the manager went back to Farmer Boo, and reticently agreed to spend one night of passion with him in exchange for use of the cattle for the rest of the tour.  The next morning, the manager, a bit sore and ashamed, loaded the cows into trucks, and delivered them to the venue of that night's show. They herded the cattle through the back doors of the theater, and onto the stage. The band played the best show that they had ever played. The cows mooed and brayed and stomped and shook their cowbells in a manner that complimented the band's performance perfectly. One prominent critic wrote that it was the best concert he'd seen in his 35 years as a music critic.  From that point on, the Spoonerists' ticket sales were though the roof, playing to sold-out crowds nearly every night, with performances on all of the late night shows, and ended up with 4 Grammy nominations, all thanks to the cows.  At the Grammy's after party, the manager stood in the shadows, enjoying his success, but not wanting to co-opt the band's big night. A music industry reporter approached him and said, "You're the manager of the biggest band in the world right now, in spite of going through some extreme ups and downs. Tell me, what's the secret to your success?"  The manager thought for a moment, and replied, "A herd in the band is worth Boo in the tush."

He goes out with his mates to the pub with a promise to his wife he shall be home by midnight and will not get drunk. He gets to the bar, several hours and many drinks later, the man is in a terrible state.  He has thrown up over himself, fallen over and generally ended up blind drunk. His mates decide to take him home but he protests "I cant go home like this, my wife said she will kick me out!".   A friend of his comes up the idea of putting £20 in his jacket pocket and telling his wife another man threw up over him and gave him the £20 to pay the cleaning bill. Thinking this is a great idea the man heads home, arriving around 2am to find his wife standing in the hallway.  Before she can say anything he explains how a man at the bar vomited on him and gave him the money to pay to have his clothes cleaned. She then asked "well why have you got £40 in your pocket?"  The man replies "Ah well the other 20 is from the man who shat in my pants."

3	My dad told me this joke in Serbian years ago. Hope it translates well. A man is terminally ill and has 3 months left to live. Seeing as he was a holy man for all his life, God gave him a visit and granted him 3 wishes. The man ponders for a few minutes then asks for his first wish.  “God, I’d love to have a nice steak dinner and some brandy to wash it down with.”  So, God waves his hand and a juicy steak and plum brandy appear in front of the man. He devours it. Whilst eating the steak the man thought of his second wish.   He asked, “God, can you make sure my children and grandchildren stay safe and healthy until it’s their time to go? I want them to live long lives.”  God thought over the idea of protecting the mans family and eventually agreed, “Sure, you’ve been a holy man all your life, it’s the least I could do.”  The man thought long and hard of what he wanted for his final wish. After a few minutes he inquired,   “God, I’ve always wanted to visit America but I was too scared to fly or go by boat, is it possible to build a road spanning the ocean so that I can drive to America in my car?”  God thought about it for a few minutes and responded, “I’m sorry but I’m afraid a project like that is going to take forever. Do you wish of anything else?”  The man thought, “God, I would consider myself a good man, a holy man. But, I’ve been married and divorced 4 times. I just don’t understand it. Can you grant me the power to understand women’s logic and reasoning?”  God, surprised by the question, took a few minutes to think and eventually responded,  “Sir, about that road, would you like 1 or 2 lanes?”

The next day he returns to the hardware store to complain. I only got 50 trees today!! You lied to me!  No no, I didn't lie, says the employee. You should start earlier, like at 8 o'clock AM and work to 6 PM!   The guy goes back and the next day he starts at 8 and works with no breaks till 6. He returns to the store and shouts, this is impossible! I worked from 8 to 6. You lied to me, I only got 75.  I did not lie, says the store employee. You know what? Tomorrow I will come and help you, to show you it is definitely possible to get 100.  So the next day they go to the woods. The employee says, let me try. He starts the chainsaw.   The man steps back and says, what is that weird sound coming from the saw!!!

3	A small church had a very attractive big-busted organist, and her breasts were so large that they bounced and jiggled while she played the organ. Unfortunately, she distracted the male part of the congregation considerably. The very proper church ladies were appalled. They said something had to be done about this or they would have to get another organist.   So one of the ladies approached Susan very discreetly about the problem, & told her to mash up some green persimmons & rub them on her nipples and all over her breasts, which should cause them to shrink in size, but warned her not to taste any of the green persimmons, because they are so sour they will make your mouth pucker up & you won't be able to talk properly for a while. The voluptuous organist reluctantly agreed to try it.   The following Sunday morning the minister walked up to the pulpit and said, “Dew to thircumsthanthis bewond my contwol, we will not hab a thermon tewday.
1	A young man wanted to learn an instrument, so he bought himself a bass guitar. Not knowing where to begin, he decides to take music lessons. After some searching he finds an old bassist who is offering beginner classes at a reasonable rate. He calls the man and they schedule a meeting for the next evening.  The young man leaves work the next day and heads to the lesson. The teacher asks him: "Do you have any prior experience in playing an instrument?" "No", the man replies. "Very well then, we'll start with the basics. See the biggest string on your bass? That's called the E-string. Try plucking it with your fingers". The man does as instructed, and the hour-long lesson goes by quickly. The young man goes home satisfied.  A week later the young man comes back for another lesson. "All right", the teacher says, "you seem to be plucking that open E-string quite well. Let's try A, the second largest string now." Again the lesson goes by quickly, and the young man happily drives home.  Another week goes by and the teacher is preparing the room for another lesson. The young man, however, is nowhere to be seen. The teacher tries to call him but he doesn't pick up. "Must be busy with something" he thinks, and goes about his business.  But the same thing happens for the next two weeks as well, with the young man nowhere to be seen. Concerned, the teacher calls his student and finally gets a hold of him. "What's the matter? We've barely even started and you're skipping lessons. Don't you want to learn more?"  "Oh sorry" the man replies. "I would love to attend the lessons, but I'm getting so many job offers from bands that I just don't have the time anymore!"

The very next day someone comes in looking for a vacuum cleaner, but as luck would have it they are out of stock again. The employee, prepared this time, quickly runs to a neighboring store.

2	A farmer named Clyde had a tractor accident... In court, the trucking company's fancy hot shot lawyer, was questioning Clyde. "Didn't you say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine,'?" asked the lawyer.  Clyde responded, "Well, I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite cow, Bessie, into the..."  "I didn't ask for any details", the lawyer interrupted. "Just answer the question, ...please. Did you, or did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine!'?"  Clyde said, "Well, I had just got Bessie into the trailer behind the tractor and I was driving down the road...."  The lawyer interrupted again and said, "Your Honor, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question."  By this time, the Judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer, "I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite cow, Bessie".  Clyde thanked the Judge and proceeded. "Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite cow, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my John Deer Tractor right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting, real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.  Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning, so he went over to her. After he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, "How are you feeling?"  "Now tell me, what the heck would you say?"

One day, a very thick fog rolls in grounding all of the planes.  Jimmy and Jason are bored out of their minds with nothing to do.  "I'm really bored," says Jimmy.  "I wish we could get drunk or something."  "We can," responds Jason.  "Did you know that if you drink jet fuel, it will get you fucked up like regular booze."  "Yeah?" asked Jimmy.  "And the best part," continued Jason, "is that there are no aftereffects.  No hangover or nuthin."  "Well, shit," exclaims Jimmy, pour me a drink.  So our two heroes spend the night getting absolutely hammered on jet fuel to the point of blacking out.  The next morning, Jimmy wakes up.  He raises his head from the pillow expecting the worst.  Surprisingly he feels perfect!  No hangover, nausea, nothing.  He gets up and takes a few steps and doesn't even feel lightheaded.  He is shocked.  Suddenly his cell phone rings and it is Jason.  He picks it up.   "Hey man, this is amazing.  I feel great.  I can't believe how much jet fuel we drank last night, but I feel awesome!  That stuff is amazing!"  "That's great," responds Jason.  "Look, there's something I need to tell you."  "Yeah," responds Jimmy.  "Whatever you do, DON'T FART!  I'm in Cleveland!"

Her husband came home unexpectedly, so she hid her lover in the closet. The boy now has company.

1	Not sure if this belongs here, but please read!!!! Back on January 9th, a group of HELLS ANGELS, South Carolina bikers were riding east on 378 when they saw a girl about to jump off the Pee Dee River Bridge. So they stopped.   George, their leader, a big burly man of 53, gets off his Harley, walks through a group of gawkers, past the State Trooper who was trying to talk her down off the railing, and says, "Hey Baby . . . whatcha doin' up there on that railin'?"   She says tearfully, "I'm going to commit suicide!!"   While he didn't want to appear "sensitive," George also didn't want to miss this "be-a-legend" opportunity either so he asked . . . "Well, before you jump, Honey-Babe . . . why don't you give ol' George here your best last kiss?"   So, with no hesitation at all, she leaned back over the railing and did just that . . . and it was a long, deep, lingering kiss followed immediately by another even better one.   After they breathlessly finished, George gets a big thumbs-up approval from his biker-buddies, the onlookers, and even the State Trooper, and then says, "Wow! That was the best kiss I have ever had! That's a real talent you're wasting there, Sugar Shorts. You could be famous if you rode with me. Why are you committing suicide?"   "My parents don't like me dressing up like a girl."   It's still unclear whether she jumped or was pushed.

The next night, the bartender is again behind his bar when the same well dressed but intoxicated man stumbles in.  "Bartender! A drink for everyone, a drink for me, and a drink for yourself!"

He pours all the drinks, the the whole bar cheers, they all drink. Bartender hands the bill to the man, and he again shrugs and says, "Oh I didn't bring my wallet with me again, sorry." The bartender proceeds to beat the man even harder and kicks him out.  Third night in a row, the bartender just cant believe his eyes when he sees the man return.  "Bartender! A drink for everyone, and a drink for me!" The man calls out as he approaches.  The bartender is fuming and grins sardonically, "What, no drink for ME tonight?"  The drunk looks at him and says, "Nah man, you get way too violent when you drink."

1	A Joke My Grandma Told Me A farmer named Clyde had a tractor accident. In court, the trucking company's fancy hot shot lawyer, was questioning Clyde. "Didn't you say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine,'?" asked the lawyer.  Clyde responded, "Well, I'll tell you what happened. I had just loaded my favorite cow, Bessie, into the..."  "I didn't ask for any details", the lawyer interrupted. "Just answer the question, ...please. Did you, or did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'I'm fine!'?"  Clyde said, "Well, I had just got Bessie into the trailer behind the tractor and I was driving down the road....  The lawyer interrupted again and said, "Your Honor, I am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the Highway Patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. Now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. I believe he is a fraud. Please tell him to simply answer the question."  By this time, the Judge was fairly interested in Clyde's answer and said to the lawyer, "I'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite cow, Bessie".  Clyde thanked the Judge and proceeded. "Well, as I was saying, I had just loaded Bessie, my favorite cow, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my John Deer Tractor right in the side. I was thrown into one ditch and Bessie was thrown into the other. I was hurting, real bad and didn't want to move. However, I could hear old Bessie moaning and groaning. I knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.  Shortly after the accident a Highway Patrolman came on the scene. He could hear Bessie moaning and groaning, so he went over to her. After he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. Then the Patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, "How are you feeling?" "Now tell me, what the heck would you say?"

His friend asks him  "Hey, where did you get such a big lighter?"  He responds "From my magic genie, of course!"   Of course his friend doesn't believe him and says "you don't have a magic genie!"  He responds with  "yes I do! I'll prove it!,"  So he goes over to his golf bag and unzips a compartment and POOF! And suddenly a genie appears!  The genie tells his friend "to prove that I'm real, I'll give you one wish! Choose wisely!"  So his friends thinks about it and says "okay, I wish for a million bucks!"  Before you know it there are suddenly a whole bunch of ducks flying all around the golfers.  The guy then says to his friend "Oh, I forgot to mention that my genie is hard of hearing.

"Hell no, and besides you are drunk" and slams the door shut.  As he gets back into bed, his wife begins to lecture him.  "Don't you remember when we were stranded on the side of the road and people stopped to help us?" "You should go outside and help the poor man."  Realizing this, the husband gets dressed and heads to the door. Opening it, he realizes the man has left and yells out, "Do you still need a push?"  In the distance he hears a reply, "Yes Please."  "Where are you?" to which he hears, "Over here on the swing set."

1	As COVID-19 devastates the economy, people are forced to stand in line for fruits and vegetables. Ahmed's wife asks him to go to the market to get pears, peas, peaches, and grapes... He goes to the market, sees people standing in lines, but can't see the line for the pears. He asks someone "is this the line for the bears?"   "What are you talking about? What bears?" the man replies. Another Arab man, let's call him Abdul, hears this and steps in, "he meant "pears". There is no letter "P" in Arabic."   "Oh, okay," the man replies. "Yes, this is the line for pears."  Ahmed stands in line, gets the pears, and then looks for the line for the peas. He can't find it, and asks another man, "where is the line for the bees?"  "What are you talking about? They're not selling bees here," the man replies. Again, Abdul overhears, and explains, "he meant "peas". There is no letter "P" in Arabic."   "Oh, okay," the man replies. "Over there is the line for peas."  Ahmed stands in line, gets the peas, and then looks for the line for the peaches. He can't find it, and asks another man, "where is the line for the beaches?"  "What did you say? Did you say "beaches" or "bitches?," the man replies. Once again, Abdul overhears, and explains, "he meant "peaches". There is no letter "P" in Arabic."   "Oh, okay," the man replies. "This is the line for peaches."  Ahmed stands in line, gets the peaches, and then looks for the line for the grapes. He can't find it, and asks another man, "where is the line for the grabes?"  "You mean grapes? There are usually two lines for grapes, but unfortunately the only one they have today is the single line - when you get to the front of the line, you only get a single grape. There is no bunch line.

Ya know Sally? with the big ...?"    "Yeah, I know Sally", says barman.    "So I was down there, just having a couple ... Feeling pretty good, and Sally says to me, she says 'Hey, I want to close up early. Why don't ya come back with me back to my place?'"    "Wow, says the barman. That's not a bad night"      "Wait for it, I haven't finished yet. We go back to her place. She's clearly feeling frisky. I try it on a bit, yankow. Ease over on the couch. She jumps at it. Rips my clothes off. Rips her clothes off. We jump on the bed and start going at it. So we're bangin' away, ooohin' and Ahhhin'."    "Hey that's pretty good. Sally is a very nice girl. What a night" says barman.      "Wait, I haven't finished yet. So we're goin' at it, Ooohin' and ahhhin'. You'll never guess what happens."      "What happened?" says barkeep.      "There's a sound of keys in the door. It's her boyfriend. She says 'Oh no, quick, he's crazy. You've got to hide'. So I look for a place, but there's nothing. I end up out on the window ledge, hanging from me fingers. It's pitch black, cold outside, the wind is whipping passed my ass and I'm freezing to death!"      "Oh I see the problem", sasy barman.      "Wait, I haven't finished yet. The guy walks in, sees Sally on the bed naked, jumps in straight away. And they're banging away and ooohin'n'aaaahin'. And I'm stuck outside, pitch black, hanging from me finger tips, freezing cold, wind whipping passed my ass, and i'm freezing to death."      "Oh, that's bad."      "Wait, I haven't finsihed yet. So suddenly, the guy stops. Says 'Sally, sorry but I got take a piss.' Instead of going to the toilet like a normal person, he opens the window, takes a piss out the window. So I'm hanging from me finger tips, it's pitch black, freezing cold, piss dripping passed me ears, wind whipping passed my ass, and i'm freezing to death."  "Oh no ... " says barman.      "Wait, I haven't finished yet. The guy finishes, goes back to the bed, jumps on top of Sally, and they're bangin' away and oohin' and aaahin'. You'll never guess what happens. He stops again, says 'Sally, look, I'm feeling a little woozy. I have to throw up'. Instead of going to the toilet like a normal person, he opens the window, upchucks his guts out. So I'm hanging there, it's pitch black, freezing cold, piss dripping down me neck, vomit plopped on top of my head, wind whipping passed my ass, and i'm freezing to death."      "Oh please no" says the barman, looking a bit uneasy.      "Wait I haven't finished yet. He finishes, goes back all fresh, jumps on top of Sally, and they're bangin' away and oohin' and aaahin'. You'll never guess what happens. He stops again, says 'Sally, look, I'll be done in a second. I need to take a dump'. Instead of going to the toilet like a normal person, he sticks his ass out the window ... anyway, so I'm hanging there, it's pitch black, freezing cold, piss dripping down me chest, vomit gooping round me ears, a shit plopped on top of my head, wind whipping passed my ass, and i'm freezing to death."      "Oh, let it stop" says the barkeep.      "Wait I haven't finished yet. The guy finishes, goes back to Sally, they're bangin' away, oohin'0n0aaaahin'. And finally they're done. they go to sleep. At that point, dawn appears, the sun comes up. It's day time. And I'm hangin' there, freezing cold, piss dripping down me legs, vomit oozing down my back, a shit sliding round me ears, wind whipping passed my ass, I'm freezing to death, and I'm six inches off the ground."

3	Three couples check into a hotel for their honeymoons. The man at the front desk has a game he likes to play. When the first couple checked in,  he asked the bride what her job was. She said she was a maid. The man thought to himself "Maids are hot. This guy's going to have a fun honeymoon."  When the next couple checked in, he asked the bride the same question. She told him she was a nurse. The man at the front desk thought "nurses are even sexier. This guy's going to get laid."  The third couple checked in right after. The same question was asked. The bride said she was a high school teacher. The man behind the desk scoffed. "Teachers are so strict." He thought. "They'll probably go right to bed."  Just an hour later, the first groom came down to eat. "Already? I thought you'd be spending the night with your new wife." Said the man "I tried!" Replied the groom. "But she insisted on tidying up the room."  Another hour passed, and the second groom came down to get some food. The man asked "What are you doing down here so early?" And the groom said "Every time I tried to have sex with her, she just told me I wasn't clean enough."  The man expected the third groom to come down soon, but he never did. He waited for hours and hours. Right near the end of his shift, the man finally saw the third groom come down, looking extremely tired. "There you are!" Said the man. "Did you get enough sleep?"  "I never slept." Replied the groom. "My wife kept saying "We're going to do this again and again until you get it right."  Edit: Fixed a typo

Exasperated, the man goes to his friend for advice, but his friend says, "that's funny, I sent my son to Israel last year and when he came back, he also said he was Christian."  The two men decide to speak to their rabbi about this, but when they explain the situation the rabbi says, "that's funny, two years ago I sent my son to Israel, and he also came back a Christian."  The three men decide only God can have the answer, so they pray. The rabbi says aloud "dear God, all three of us sent our sons to Israel, and all of them came back Christian."  God's voice booms down, "that's funny…"  ****Please excuse this repost but since it's Easter I thought it was timely for those that have not seen it.****

I said, "Look, I woke up this morning with a temperature of 102 (I didn't), plus I work around hundreds of people in close quarters (I don’t),so this mask is for your protection, not mine. How about I take it off and we hug like old friends?" I stepped toward her and acted as if I was taking off my mask. She stepped back away from me and went across to the next row of cars. I followed her, she kept walking away, I chased her, she ran... She fell down. I grabbed her foot. I pulled on her leg, just like I’m pulling yours.

But after 2 months, only 3 Samurai applied for the job: a Japanese, a Chinese, and Moishe. So he interviewed all three. The emperor first asked the Japanese to demonstrate why he should be his chief Samurai. The Japanese opened a little silver box and out flew a little fly. Whoosh went his sword and the fly dropped dead in two pieces. The emperor was impressed.  The emperor then asked the Chinese to demonstrate why he should be his chief Samurai. The Chinese opened a small pearl box and out flew a smaller fly. Whoosh, whoosh went his sword and the fly dropped dead in four pieces. The emperor was very impressed.  Then the emperor asked Moishe to demonstrate why he should be his chief Samurai. Moishe opened a small gold box and out flew a wasp. Whoooooossshhh, whoooooossshhh, whooooooossshhh, whoooooossshhh, whoooooossshhh went Moishe's sword, but the wasp was still alive and buzzing around the emperor.  The emperor was very disappointed and asked Moishe, "After all your sword play, why is the wasp not dead?"  Moishe replied, "A circumcision is not intended to kill."

If you come back to our house drunk like that tonight, we're through."  The man agrees with her, and heads out to meet his friends.  However, during the course of the evening, one thing leads to another, and the man gets drunk to the point where he vomits all over his shoes and shirt. Crying, he sobs to his friend that "this is it for him and his girlfriend."   His friend pauses, and says "Show her some money to her and tell her that another guy got drunk, was sick on you and then handed you money as an apology."  So the man comes back home, sobered up but still smelling of vomit. Just as his girlfriend is about to berate him, he pulls out a £10, telling her that another guy got drunk that night and was sick all over him. She says that she was glad he didn't get stupidly drunk this time.  The man pulls out another £10 note, and says "This one's from a guy who shit in my pants."

He puts on a pair of sunglasses and enters the bar, making sure to stumble a bit so that he looks blind.  "No dogs allowed," the waiter tells him.  "But this is my guide dog," the man replies. "I can't go anywhere without him."  "Nice try," the waiter says. "I let those other two guys in because they both had golden retrievers, but there's no way a chihuahua can be a guide dog."  The third guy tries his best to look confused and angry.  "They gave me a chihuahua?"

He asked the boy how he did it and he replied: “Well this guy was going fishing so I asked if he wanted some fish hooks. He said sure. That’s $1. I asked if he had a nice fishing pole. He said no and got a graphite pole for $44. I asked if he had a nice reel. He said no and I got him a reel for $35. I asked where he will be fishing and he said White Lake.  “I said the best places to fish are near the centre, and when he said he didn’t have a boat, I set him up with a 10 metre cruiser for $28,000. I asked if he had a trailer. He didn’t, so I got him a double axle trailer for $3,000. Then I asked what he had to tow the boat. He only had a station wagon, so I told him that just wouldn’t do, but we could get him a nice fully loaded Dodge Ram for $48,000. He wanted it all”.  The store manager was astounded: “And to think it all began with that man asking for fish hooks.”  The boy said: “Oh no, it all began with him asking for some $3.25 tampons for his girlfriend, and I said: ‘Well you won’t be doing much this weekend so you might as well go fishing!'”

3	The Americans and The Japanese The Americans and the Japanese decided to engage in a competitive boat race. Both teams practiced rowing hard and long to reach their peak performance. On the big day the Japanese won by a mile.  The American team was discouraged by the loss. Morale sagged. Corporate management decided that the reason for the crushing defeat had to be found, so a consulting firm was hired to investigate the problem and recommend corrective action.  The consultant's finding: The Japanese team had eight people rowing and one person steering; the American team had one person rowing and eight people steering.  After a year of study and millions spent analyzing the problem, the American team's management structure was completely reorganized.  The new structure: four steering managers, three area steering managers, and a new performance review system for the person rowing the boat to provide work incentive.  The next year, the Japanese won by two miles!  Humiliated, the American corporation laid off the rower for poor performance and gave the managers a bonus for discovering the problem.

2	What’s the worst place to hide in a hospital? The ICU
1	An engineer, a physicist and a mathematician are staying in a hotel. The engineer wakes up and smells smoke. He goes out into the hallway and sees a fire, so he fills a trashcan from his room with water and douses the fire. He goes back to bed.  Later, the physicist wakes up and smells smoke. He opens his door and sees a fire in the hallway. He walks down the hall to a fire hose and after calculating the flame velocity, distance, water pressure and trajectory, extinguishes the fire with the minimum amount of water and energy needed.   Then, the mathematician wakes up and smells smoke. He goes to the hall, sees the fire and then the fire hose. He thinks for a moment and exclaims, "Ah, a solution exists!" and then goes back to bed.
2	Farting in bed  This is a story about a couple who had been happily married for years, the only friction in their marriage was the husbands habit of farting loudly every morning when he awoke the noise would wake his wife and the smell would make her eyes water and make her gasp for air. Every morning she would plead with him to stop ripping them off because it was making her sick. He told her he couldn't stop it and that it was perfectly natural. She told him to see a doctor, she was concerned that one day he would blow his guts out. The years went by and he continued to rip them out. Then one Christmas day morning, as she was preparing the turkey for dinner and he was upstairs sound asleep, she looked at the innards, neck, gizzard, liver and all the spare parts, and a malicious thought came to her. She took the bowl and went upstairs where her husband was sound asleep and, gently pulling the bed covers back, she pulled back the elastic waistband of his underpants and emptied the bowl of turkey guts into his shorts. Sometime later she heard her husband waken with his usual trumpeting which was followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of frantic footsteps as he ran into the bath room. The wife could hardly control herself as she rolled on the floor laughing, tears in her eyes! After years of torture she reckoned she had got him back pretty good. About twenty minutes later, her husband came downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of horror on his face. She bit her lip as she asked him what was the matter. He said, Honey you were right all these years you have warned me and I didn't listen to you. What do you mean? asked his wife. Well, you always told me that one day I would end up farting my guts out, and today it finally happened, but by the grace of god, some Vaseline and two fingers. I think I got most of them back in.........

Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said: "Watson, look up at the sky, and tell me what you see." Watson replied: "I see millions and millions of stars."

1	The outmaneuvre ! An Airbus 380 is on its way across the Atlantic. It flies consistently at 800 km/h in 30,000 feet, when suddenly a Eurofighter with Tempo Mach 2 appears. The pilot of the fighter jet slows down, flies alongside the Airbus and greets the pilot of the passenger plane by radio: "Airbus flight, boring flight isn’t it? Take care and have a look here!”  He rolls his jet on its back, accelerates, breaks through the sound barrier, rises rapidly to a dizzying height, only to swoop down almost to sea level in a breathtaking dive. He loops back next to the Airbus and asks, "Well, how was that?"  The Airbus pilot answers: "Very impressive, but now have a look here!"  The jet pilot watches the Airbus, but nothing happens. It continues to fly stubbornly straight, with the same speed. After five minutes, the Airbus pilot radioed, "Well, what are you saying now?"  The jet pilot asks confused: "What did you do?"   The other laughs and says, "I got up, stretched my legs, went to the back of the flight to the bathroom, got a cup of coffee and a cinnamon cake and made an appointment with the stewardess for the next three nights - in a 5 Star hotel, which is paid for by my employer !!

2	There is a parrot at the Vatican who speaks dozens of languages. This brilliant parrot had been with the Vatican for years. One day, he discovered an old rotary telephone that was still functioning tucked away in a forgotten room within the facility. Lonely as the parrot was, and able to speak so many languages, he began to place call after call to every corner of the earth, engaging in endless conversations with hundreds of people. This went on for some time, until the monthly phone bill arrived...  The parrot had rang up thousands of dollars worth of international calls, and the bishops we’re furious. To teach the bird a lesson, they bound the gregarious parrot to a crucifix with twine and left him in a dank basement to ruminate upon his actions.   After several hours in quiet misery, a shining ray appeared and cast its light upon an ancient crucifix of Jesus directly across the parrot. Suddenly, Jesus spoke to the Parrot:  “My creature, I have come to ease your woes”  “Who are you?” Spoke the parrot  “I am Jesus Christ, do you know my name?”  “I do not!” Squawked the parrot, “how long have you been hanging there?”  “Two thousand and twenty years my son”  “SQUAK!!! Holy shit- where did you call?!?”

2	Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently... Researchers for the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority found over 200 dead crows near greater Boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from avian flu.  A bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely not avian flu.  The cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.  However, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws.  By analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.   MTA then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.   The ornithological behaviorist very quickly determined the cause:  When crows eat road kill, they always have a lookout crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.  They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout "Cah", not a single one could shout "Truck."

They play a friendly game of croquet and then dine on lobster and caviar.  The Devil himself comes up to Johnson with a frosty drink, "Have a Marguerita and relax, Boris!" "Uh, I can't drink any more, I’m watching my weight," says Johnson, dejectedly. "This is Hell, Boris: you can drink and eat all you want and not worry, and it just gets better from there!" Johnson takes the drink and finds himself liking the Devil, who he thinks is a really very friendly guy who tells funny jokes and pulls hilarious nasty pranks. kind of like an Oxford undergrad. They are having such a great time that, before he realizes it, it's time to go. Everyone gives him a big hug and waves as Johnson steps on the elevator and heads upward.  When the elevator door reopens, he is in Heaven again and St. Peter is waiting for him. "Now it's time to visit Heaven," the old man says, opening the gate.  So for 24 hours, Johnson is made to chill with a bunch of honest, good-natured people who enjoy each other's company, talk about things other than money and treat each other decently. Not a nasty prank or mean joke among them; no fancy country seats and, while the food tastes great, it's not caviar or lobster. And these people are all poor, he doesn't see anybody he knows, and he isn't even treated like someone special! Worst of all, to Johnson, Jesus turns out to be some kind of hippie with his endless 'peace' and 'do unto others' stuff. "Whoa," he says uncomfortably to himself, "Margaret never prepared me for this!" The day is done, St. Peter returns and says, "Well, then, you've spent a day in Hell and a day in Heaven. Now choose where you want to live for eternity."  With the 'Jeopardy' theme playing softly in the background, Johnson reflects for a minute, then answers: "Well, I would never have thought I'd say this - I mean, Heaven has been delightful and all - but I really think I belong in Hell with my friends." So Saint Peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down, all the way to Hell.  The doors of the elevator open and he is in the middle of barren scorched earth called Brexit Britain covered with garbage and toxic industrial waste...  He is horrified to see all of his friends, dressed in rags and chained together, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags. They are groaning and moaning in pain, faces and hands black with grime. The Devil comes over to Johnson and puts an arm around his shoulder.  "I don't understand," stammers a shocked Johnson, "Yesterday I was here and there was a country house and we ate lobster and caviar....drank cocktails. We lounged around and had a great time. Now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and everybody looks miserable!"  The Devil looks at him smiles slyly, and purrs, "Yesterday we were campaigning; today you voted for us"
2	The tale of the bear and the rabbit A bear and a rabbit is sitting next to each other in the woods, taking a shit when the bear asks the rabbit.  “Do you mind when you get shit stuck in your fur? “No.” says the rabbit. The bear then proceeds to wipe his ass with the rabbit.  A few weeks later, as both walk together they stumble upon a lamp, lying under a large birch tree. “Oh look! Maybe it’s a magical lamp” says the bear as he picks the lamp up and rubs it with his large paws. There is a big puff of smoke and suddenly, a genie appears from the smoke, coughing a bit, “Whoaa, you awoke my slumber, and now I have to grant you three wishes each, \\*yaaaawn\\*”. “I should definitely go first, since I found it” the bear proudly states. “Sure, whatever”. “I want all the bears in this forest, except me, to be female. Oooooh looooord I’m gonna get so much pussey”. The genie waves hands and says that his wish has come true. “I would like a motorcycle.” says the rabbit. “Pfft, what a fucking idiot” acclaim the bear. But the genie does the same waving of the hands, and a motorcycle appears with a puff of smoke. Now the bear goes again, “I want all the bears, except me, in this COUNTRY to be female, DAAAAAMN I’m gonna get so much pussey!”. Once again, the genie waves his hands and it’s done. The rabbit this time asks for a motorcycle helmet, as the bear just shakes his head. As well as the previous wish, it is granted and he stands with a helmet in his hands. The bear is bouncing up and down at this point, “I-i-i-i, I want all the bears, except me, in THE WHOLE WORLD to be female, OH MY GOOOOD I’m gonna get so much pusseeeey!!!”. “You know you could’ve asked that the first time?” says the rabbit. “Whatever, at least I didn’t ask for a stupid motorcycle and a weird helmet”. The genie waves his hands and says that all the bears in the world, except him, are now female. The rabbit proceeds to mount his new shining motorcycle, adjusts his helmet, and says, “I wish the fucking bear is gay.”, and accelerates into the distance flipping the bear off.

The announcer says, “Alright, I’m going to ask you one question what is 2+2?”  The crowd was silent. The woman on stage was shaking and thinking. After a few seconds, she puts her head to the microphone and says, “43?”  The crowd sighed and went, “ooh.” Somewhere in the crowd, a chant starts up- “Give her another chance! Give her another chance!”  The announcer says, “Alright, alright, we’ll give her another chance. One more time, what’s 2+2?”   The woman thought for another few seconds. She went up to the microphone and said, “14?”  The crowd did it again. Faster, the chant started up again- “Give her another chance! Give her another chance!”  “Alright, one last time,” the announcer said. “What is 2+2?”  The woman thought for a long while. Finally, she said, “4?”  The crowd immediately started chanting again. “Give her another chance, give her another chance!”

2	The local bar was so sure that The local bar was so sure that its owner was the strongest man around that it offered a standing $1,000 bet that no could beat him. The challenge was that the owner would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran out into a beer glass, then hand the lemon to the customer. Anyone who could squeeze even one more drop out of the lemon would win the money.   Over the years many people had tried this, truck drivers, weightlifters and all had failed. Then one day this frail little fella with heavy rimmed spectacles came into the bar and asked if he could try the challenge. After the laughter had subsided the owner said that it was only fair that the man be given a chance at the bet, so he picked up a lemon and started squeezing. Once he was done he handed the remains to the little man who promptly squeezed out 4 more drops of juice onto the bar. Everyone looked on in amazement as the owner handed over the prize and asked, "What do you do for a living that has given you such strength? Are you a lumberjack, weightlifter, what?" "No" the man replied, "I work for the IRS."

The captain being the observant leader that he was, knew that these poor men weren't getting enough satisfaction.  "Men" the captain started, "I'm aware of your plights. So tell you what, I'm going to do this favor for you"  This caught the attention of the three young privates.  The captain continued, "I have a horse at the back named Shelly, and I use her 5 times a week -- she's the best. And tonight, I'm willing to lend her to you as long you clean my office spotless by the time I get back here tomorrow morning."  The three soldiers were taken aback, nevertheless they made a short discussion before finally answering, "We humbly take your offer, sir!"  The next day, the captain arrived in his office to see it absolutely sparklingly clean. He was delighted! He called for the three young men to commend them on their job, and ask them how their night went.  "Oh captain, we would've licked your boots clean too. Shelly was amazing!" replied one of them  "Best fuck we ever got," replied another  "Say captain, can we do her once a week? We'll keep your office shiny of course," the last one chipped in  The captain jumped from his seat in disgust, "You bastards, what have you done?! Shelly was just supposed to take you to the brothel down town!"

1	The Tale of Kevin Bopper Back in high school there was this kid named Kevin Bopper. He was... strange, to say the least. He was that quiet kid with long, greasy, dandruff-ridden hair, a face full of acne, and wore a leather jacket- you know the type. The thing that made him stand out, however, was his weird fixation on traffic cones. Yeah, traffic cones.  Like, this kid fucking LOVED traffic cones. He had a traffic cone keychain on both his key ring AND backpack. His profile picture on Facebook had him posing with a traffic cone. I once saw him riding his bike with a (probably stolen) traffic cone clenched under his arm, barely keeping balance as he rode along. He dressed up as a construction worker for a Halloween party and brought a traffic cone. He even had a dinky pencil topper that was shaped like a traffic cone. Weird ass shit, right?  Alright. It’s senior year. Kevin and I have English class with Mrs. McCopper (she just went by her first name, Jane). Jane was beloved by the community. She went to all the school events, and would even sit in the press box and commentate the home soccer games. Overall a really chill teacher. She had lost her 10 year old daughter to cancer just a few years before I got into high school. She always wore a necklace her daughter made her. On the necklace was a blue fishing bobber with a cartoon sea otter printed on it. Jane wore it every time I saw her.  Anyways, one Friday during class Kevin would not stop messing with his dinky-ass traffic cone pencil topper. Like he’d beat it against the desk and shake it around like he was a child.   It. was. obnoxious.  Eventually, Jane had enough and she took it from him. She said he could have it back on Monday. Kevin was very upset to say the least.   Cut to the Friday night soccer game. During this specific game a 15-minute “half time” was called to honor a member of the community named James Van-Bonner.   James was an ex-convict turned success story. When he was 18 years old, he picked up a toddler and literally chucked the poor kid into a lake. The kid survived luckily. After 10 long years in jail, along with 5 years of intense therapy, James has since committed his life to fostering children and youth.  During this “halftime” Kevin’s dad started storming his way up the stands toward the press box. He looked PISSED. Now, Kevin’s dad was a huge, burley man. He worked on a farm stocking hay. This was not the type of guy you wanted to mess with.  The man-beast makes his way in and screams at Jane about Kevin’s pencil topper. Jane explains what happened, but Kevin’s dad was having none of it. The hulk of a man punches Jane right in the fucking tits and then rips off Jane’s necklace and stomps on it- shattering it into pieces. Jane falls to the ground sobbing.  Kevin’s dad makes a run for it, but James Van-Bonner steps in his way to block him. Kevin’s dad shoves James down the stands. As James falls, he hits his head on one of the seats and goes limp.  Eventually Kevin’s dad is subdued and arrested. Paramedics arrive, but James is already dead. It was a terrible loss in the community.  So there it is. That’s the tale of Kevin Bopper and how his stupid traffic cone pencil topper killed an innocent man and traumatized my teacher.  TL;DR: Mrs.McCopper took Bopper’s topper. His father, the fodder stocker, popped her knockers atop her soccer spotter, crushed her daughter’s otter water bobber, and caused the slaughter of ex-toddler lobber turned child foster, James Van-Bonner.
2	One day, little Susie was sitting in Sunday School Susie was a good kid who liked to pay attention in here sunday school bible classes. The only problem was the she sat in front of the class delinquent, Joe. While the teacher was teaching, she decided to ask the class a question to make sure all the kids were paying attention.   "So class, who was it that created the universe?"   Just then, Joe, being the ornery sob he was took his pencil and poked Susie in the side!   "DEAR GOD!" Exclamed Susie in surprise.   "Very good, Susie!" Said the teacher.   Some time had passed and the teacher decided to ask another question of the class.   "Who gave birth to the savior?"   Joe, being a bastard, again took his pencil and jabbed poor Susie in the side with it!   "SWEET MOTHER MARY!" She cried.   "That's right again, Susie!" Voiced the teacher.   Once again, some time had passed and the teacher decided to ask yet another question.   "What did Eve say to Adam after their 6th child?"   Susie, who had caught on to Joe's antics, catches him just before he's about to get her again and yelled,   "If you stick me with that thing one more time I'm going to break it in half!"

This scheme will be known as RAPE (Retire Aged People Early).  Persons selected to be RAPED can apply to the Government to be considered for the SHAFT program (Special Help After Forced Termination).  Persons who have been RAPED and SHAFTED will be reviewed under the SCREW program (System Covering Retired-Early Workers).  A person may be RAPED once, SHAFTED twice and SCREWED as many times as the Government deems appropriate.  Persons who have been RAPED could get AIDS (Additional Income for Dependents & Spouse) or HERPES (Half Earnings for Retired Personnel Early Severance).  Obviously persons who have AIDS or HERPES will not be SHAFTED or SCREWED any further by the Government.  Persons who are not RAPED and are staying on will receive as much SHIT (Special High Intensity Training) as possible. The Government has always prided themselves on the amount of SHIT they give our citizens.  Should you feel that you do not receive enough SHIT, please bring this to the attention of your MP, who has been trained to give you all the SHIT you can handle.  Sincerely, The Committee for Economic Value of Individual Lives (E.V.I.L.)  PS - Due to Corona Virus, as well as current market conditions, The Light at the End of the Tunnel has been turned off.

3	Three men die and appear before Buddha...  Stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.  \\-Raise  your heads. You were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy.  You have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. You have  much to accomplish yet though.  One of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.  \\-Benevolent  Buddha, what more could I possibly do in my next life? I thought I  lived and acted to the fullest. Because of my work almost the entirety  of the earth's population will never starve.  \\-My  work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. Right  now, the world I leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines  can cure anything, such was my contribution.  \\-My connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.  \\-I  know all of your actions well. But that is still not enough. Here, let  me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that I ask  for. They are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.  The  three people now both curious and excited follow Buddha to a small  building. Their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside.  So ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the  tiniest interest. Before the Buddha can say anything else they all rush  towards him.  \\-Impossible, yells the 1st person! Such a plain human being! You! What was your work during your earthly life?  \\-Who?  M-me? I only had two part time jobs, nothing else that I can remember.  During the morning hours I worked in a small plantation. Fruits and  vegetables.  \\-You're joking! shouts the 2nd person. And the second job?  \\-Oh...that  one was a bit odd. My village had a signboard were people would post  their ads, job offers etc. But because the signboard was old, those  would sometimes come off. My job was to put them back in their place.  \\-This  is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! How could you possibly have  amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs  of yours?  \\-W-well, I don't know what to tell you. But I've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.

1	Ever heard a joke with a moral? A mosquito is flying above the surface of a lake. Beneath it, in the water, there is a salmon swimming. It sees the mosquito and thinks to itself: "If only it would fly a little lower, i could jump out of the water and catch it." On the shore, there is a bear standing quietly and thinks to itself: "If only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out, catch the mosquito and then i can rush in and eat the fish." Behind the bear in the bushes is a hunter and he thinks to himself: "If only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the fish would jump out, bear would run at the fish and i could shoot the animal, make a nice rug." Behind the huntsman, there is a little mouse and it thinks to itself: "If only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out of the water, the bear would run at the fish, huntsman would shoot and wouldn't notice that his sandwich falls out of his pocket." Behind the mouse, in the tall grass, there is a cat lurking and it's thinking to itself: "If only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out of the water, bear would run at the fish, huntsman would shoot and his sandwich falls out of his pocket, mouse would start eating it and won't be paying attention to it's surroundings and i can attack it."    And so it happens. Mosquito flies lower, salmon jumps out of the water, bear runs at the fish, huntsman shoots, sandwich falls out of his pocket, mouse is already gnawing at it and then the cat jumps at the mouse, but completely miscalculates and lands in the water. Now, what is the moral of this story? In order to get the pussy wet, you need a long foreplay.

1	A couple of years ago one night I was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate Joseph barged into the porch out of nowhere, tripped ,fell over and broke a glass table with his face. Totally ruined the mood. Now I don't know Joseph that well, don't even remember where he was from if I'm honest, but lets say I put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.   He got a big shard of glass in his eye making him blind in one eye, he had to walk around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for months. Then suddenly he disappeared along with my girlfriend, apparently they bonded during the time after his injuries. They eloped, left me behind without even a note. I tried to track them down but couldn't.  In conclusion,  if hadn't been for cotton eyed Joe, I'd have been married a long time ago.  Where did you come from, where did you go? where did you come from cotton eyed Joe?
2	Best Finnish joke i know (Does not involve snipers) 2 Finnish Longshoremen complete their hard days work at the port of Kuopio on payday,  and decide to go to the local bar to have a fun night.  No words are spoken as they sit down. They look at the bar keep, and one raises his hand, with 2 fingers up.   The bar keep brings 2 shots of Vodka.  The 2 Finns drink the Vodka- still without having said a word.  One of the Finns raises his hand with 2 fingers showing, and the bar keep brings 2 more Vodkas.  This goes on all through the night.  The 2 Finns never say a word, even after 10 shots of Vodka each.  Clearly both are feeling the alcohol after 10 shots each. Not a word has been said by either the entire night.  At this point, one Finn looks at the other and says 'Should we get another round?'  The other looks at the first with disgust, and replies  'Are we here to talk, or to drink?'

4	Three American colonels are in the US about to retire and they are offered an economic compensation... ..which consists of multiplying 100,000 dollars by the distance in inches they have between two parts of their body that they choose.   Colonel McDowell chooses this distance to be from his toe to the edge of his longest hair on his head and the result is 72 inches, so that means he gets $7,200,000.  Colonel Smith chooses the reach of his arms, that is from the tip of his right index finger to the tip of his left index finger, which results in a distance of 75 inches (so he gets $7.5M).  Finally Colonel McConaughey chooses the distance from the tip of his penis to his balls  -"*Colonel, choose two parts that are more separated, you'll win more money that way!*" - says the soldier in charge of the measurement.  -"*No, i'm sure these are the parts i want measured, please proceed!*" - answers the colonel. The soldier then proceeds to take the measuring tape from the tip of colonel's dick and stretches the tape to reach the balls when suddenly he stops and asks "*Wait...where are your balls*?!"  -"*I lost them in Vietnam*"

2	A young lady, destitute and rejected by her lover, heads to the Manhattan docks to drown herself. But just before she could throw herself from the docks, a handsome young man stopped her.  "You have so much to live for," said the man. "I'm a sailor, and we are off to Italy tomorrow. I can stow you away on my ship. I'll take care of you, bring you food every day, and keep you happy."  With nothing to lose, combined with the fact that she had always wanted to go to Italy, the woman accepted. That night the sailor brought her aboard and hid her in a small but comfortable compartment in the hold. From then on, every night he would bring her three sandwiches, a bottle of red wine, and make love to her until dawn. Three weeks later she was discovered by the captain during a routine inspection.  "What are you doing here?" asked the captain.  "I have an arrangement with one of the sailors," she replied. "He brings me food and wine -- and I get a free trip to Italy ."  "I see," the captain says.  Her conscience prevailed and she added, "Plus, he's screwing me."  "He sure is," replied the captain. "This is the Staten Island Ferry ."

Why would you want to borrow $5,000?"  The woman replies,  "Where else in New York City can I park my car for two weeks for only $15.41 and expect it to be there when I return?"

"Usually people lie to me and say that they use it on a child's bicycle chain or to help with a gate hinge. But, in fact, I know that most people do use it for sex. I admire you for your honesty. Since you've been frank so far, can you tell me exactly how you use it for sex?"

"I los' ma job, ma wife lef' me, ma kids ran 'way, and today ma dog died! Jus' you wait! I'ma come back with ma shotgun and give ya what for!"  And then he leaves, cursing and shouting all the way.  Meanwhile, the priest has been hiding in the back and saw the whole thing. He doesn't want any trouble, so he calls up a couple of friends, and together they take the big crucifix down and hide it. As an afterthought, the priest leaves a small desk crucifix in its place.  Sure enough, the drunk man comes back with his shotgun. He looks right. He looks left. When he spots the tiny crucifix in the middle, he makes his way down the center aisle, muttering under his breath. Finally, when he's right in front of it, he leans over real close and says,  "Hey, kid, where's yer dad at?"

2	A horse and a chicken were walking down a country road when they saw some corn in a ditch just across the road.  The horse walked over to eat the corn.  Before he got to the corn, he became stuck in the mud. For all his trying he could not get out of the mud.  So he tells the chicken "Hey, go over to that farm house and get some help to get me out of this mud.”  When the chicken gets to the farm house, he can't find anybody to help him get the horse out of the mud. However, he notices that there is a Mercedes parked in the driveway and the keys are in the ignition.  The chicken drives the Mercedes back down the road, ties a rope he found to the Mercedes and throws the other end to the horse.  In a jiffy the horse is out of the mud.  The two proceed down the road again when they see some more corn on the side of the road.  This time the chicken crosses over a ditch to get the corn.  And as luck would have it, the chicken gets stuck in the mud. The chicken tells the horse "Hey, go get that Mercedes and pull me out of this mud.”  The horse surveys the problem and says "I think I can straddle this ditch because it is not too big and, when I do, just grab my dick and I'll pull you out of the mud.”  The horse does as he says and the chicken is pulled out of the mud.  Turns out that when you're hung like a horse, you don't need a Mercedes to pick up chicks.

1	Managing a ranch A successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife.  She was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand.   Two cowboys applied for the job. One was gay and the other a drunk.   She thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk. ... See More  He proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and, as luck would have it, he knew a lot about ranching.   For weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well.   Then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, "You have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. You should go into town and kick up your heels." The hired hand readily agreed and went into town one Saturday night.   One o'clock came, however, and he didn't return   Two o'clock and no hired hand.   Finally he returned a round two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.   She quietly called him over to her.   "Unbutton my blouse and take it off," she said.   Trembling, he did as she directed. "Now take off my boots."   He did as she asked, ever so slowly. "Now take off my socks."   He removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.   "Now take off my skirt."   He slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light.   "Now take off my bra." Again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.   Then she looked at him and said, "If you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired."

4	A clearly inebriated woman, stark naked, jumped into a taxi in New York and laid down on the back seat. The cab driver, an old Jewish gentleman, opened his eyes wide and stared at the woman.  He made no attempt to start the cab.  The woman glared back at him and said, “What’s wrong with you, honey? Haven’t you ever seen a naked woman before?”  The old Jewish driver answered, “Let me tell you sumsing, lady I vasn’t staring at you like you tink; det vould not be proper vair I come from.”  The drunk woman giggled and responded, “Well, if you’re not staring at my boobs or ass, Sweetie, what are you doing then?”  He paused a moment, then told her…”Vell, M’am, I am looking and I am looking, and I am tinking to myself, ‘Vair in DA hell is dis lady keeping de money to pay for dis ride?”    EDIT: Can’t believe I have to write this edit because it takes away from the joke but so many of you are making comments that I feel I need to address.   I’m Jewish. This joke is funny to me and I’ve heard it many times. When I’ve heard it it is usually from another Jewish person and, while I get that any cab driver regardless of background is going to expect to get paid, the joke is that we are a smart and practical people (not cheap as so many of you seem to imply the joke is getting at and which is indeed a terrible, stupid stereotype). The old man is speaking with a Yiddish accent as do many older Jewish people who come from Europe, which is why the joke is written the way it is. If you are not familiar with it than I get the confusion.  It is exhausting that so many of you see this joke as an opportunity to call out racism. I’ve dealt with a lot of racism and mean-spirited comments because I’m Jewish, but it is the humor and joke telling in our culture that helps to minimize the impact of those statements.

The bartender hands the guy his beer and says, "You know, I'm not gay but I want to compliment you on your physique, it really is phenomenal! But I have a question, why is your head so small?" The big guy nods slowly. He's obviously fielded this question many times. "One day," he begins, "I was hunting and got lost in the woods. I heard someone crying for help.   I followed the cries and they led me to a frog that was sitting next to a stream." "No shit?" says the bartender, thoroughly intrigued. "Yeah, so I picked up the frog and it said, Kiss me. Kiss me and I will turn into a genie and grant you three wishes.'" "Keep going!" "I looked around to make sure I was alone and gave the frog a kiss. POOF! The frog turned into a beautiful, voluptuous, naked woman. She said, You now have three wishes.'   I looked down at my scrawny 115 pound body and said, I want a body like Arnold Schwarzenneger.' She nodded, snapped her fingers, and POOF there I was, so huge that I ripped out of my clothes and was standing there naked! She then asked, What will be your second wish?'"   "What next?" begged the bartender. "I looked hungrily at her beautiful body and replied, I want to make sensuous love with you here by this stream.' She nodded, laid down, and beckoned to me. We made love right there by that stream for hours! Afterwards, as we lay there next to each other, sweating from our glorious lovemaking, she whispered into my ear, You know, you do have one more wish. What will it be?'   I looked at her and replied, How about a little head?
2	A man and his wife of more than 50 years were rocking back and forth on the front porch  Slowly they rocked in rhythm, as this was their time to spend a few quiet moments and after years of practice they rocked to the same pace.  Suddenly the wife stopped, grabbed her cane, and with a loud and hard WHACK hit her husband across the shins.  His eyes watered and tears ran down his cheeks. When he finally caught his breath he gasped and asked, “What’d you do that fer?””  “That’s fer fifty years of bad sex,” she said. He nodded his head, but said nothing. Slowly they began to rock again. Again they kept pace. Back and forth, back and forth they rocked, until suddenly the man stopped, and picked up his cane. He reached over and with a loud, sharp WHACK, he hit his wife across the shins.  As soon as her eyes quit watering and she could speak she asked, “What was that fer?”  That,” said her husband as he began to rock again, “is fer knowin’ the difference!”

Now, you probably won't remember, but you were in a huge pile-up on the freeway. You're going to be okay. You’ll walk again and everything; however, your penis was severed in the accident and we couldn't find it."  Moshe groans, but the doctor goes on, "You have $9000 in insurance compensation coming and we now have the technology to build a new penis.  They work great but they don't come cheap. It's roughly $1000 an inch."  Moshe perks up. So, the doctor says, "You and your wife must decide how many inches you want. But understand that you have been married for over thirty years and this is something you should discuss with your wife. If you had a five incher before and get a nine incher now she might be a bit put out. If you had a nine incher before and you decide to only invest in a five incher now, she might be disappointed.

1	Interpreting Art At the National Art Gallery in Dublin, a husband and wife were staring at a portrait that had them completely confused. The painting depicted three black men totally naked, sitting on a bench.   Two of the figures had black penises, but the one in the middle had a pink penis. The curator of the gallery realized that they were having trouble interpreting the painting and offered his personal assessment.  He went on for over half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of African Americans in a predominately white patriarchal society . "In fact", he pointed out, "some serious critics believe that the pink penis also reflects the cultural and sociological oppression experienced by gay men in contemporary society".  After the curator left, an Irishman approached the couple and said, **"Would you like to know what the painting is really about?"**  "Now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery", asked the couple?  **"Because I am the artist, who painted the picture"**, he replied, "In fact, there are no African Americans depicted at all.  They're just three Irish coal miners. The guy in the middle went home for lunch"

2	A MAN went to the doctors suffering from a severe headache for years on end. The doctor said, “Joe, the good news is I can cure your headaches. The bad news is it will require castration. “You have a rare condition which causes your testicles to press on your spine, and the pressure creates one hell of a headache. The only way to relieve the pressure is to remove the testicles.”  Joe was shocked but he knew he had no choice but to go under the knife. When he left the hospital, he was without a headache for the first time in 20 years, and he truly believed he could make a new life. He saw a men’s clothing store and thought, “That’s what I need ... a new suit.”  He entered the shop and said, “I’d like a new suit.” The elderly tailor eyed him briefly and said, “Let’s see ... size 44 long.” Joe laughed, “That’s right, how did you know?”  “Been in the business 60 years!” the tailor said. Joe tried on the suit; it fit perfectly. The salesman asked, “How about a new shirt?”  Joe was on a roll. “Sure.” The salesman said, “Let’s see, 34 sleeves and 16 ½ neck.” Joe said, “That’s right, how did you know?” “Been in the business 60 years.” Joe tried on the shirt, and it fit perfectly.  Joe walked comfortably around the shop, and the salesman asked, “How about some new underwear?” Joe thought for a moment and said, “Sure.” The salesman said, “Let’s see ... size 36.” Joe laughed, “Ah ha! I got you, I’ve worn a size 34 since I was 18 years old.”  The salesman shook his head, “You can’t wear a size 34. A size 34 would press your testicles up against the base of your spine and give you one heck of a headache.”

They start looking around and spot an old rusty anvil.  Together they pick it up and huck it into the hole.  As they are trying to listen for the impact at the bottom of the hole, a goat comes running towards them and dives right into the hole.  “Well that was weird” said one friend and they started walking down the road to go home.  As they were walking, a farmer came up to them and frantically asked “Hey, have either of you guys seen my goat come through here?”.  “Yeah” said the friends, “we saw him running through the woods and jump in this giant hole”.  “That’s impossible” said the farmer, “he was tied to an anvil!”

2	An aging farmer decided it was time for his youngest son to start pulling his weight around the farm.     His older, strong-armed and favoured son, Jedediah worked hard every day, getting up extra early every morning to milk the cow before dutifully doing the rest of his chores.   The farmers delicious milk became very popular around the area with neighbours often walking miles in for a glass and some conversation. So, the farmer decided to buy another milk cow so he could start making some money.   The farmer realised that by God, this was a good time to get his younger, bookish son, David to start helping on the farm and so tore his book off him one morning and sent him out to milk the new cow.  He was somewhat unsurprised, but nonetheless disappointed when David came back shortly after with a full pail of inadequacy. The milk was thin and bland and lacked the rich flavour and creamy consistency of Jed’s milk. With no more than a grimace of disgust, the farmer tipped out the milk in front of his son and told him to do better tomorrow.  After two weeks of this with no improvement in the milk David was bringing in, the farmer called his sons one morning and asked Jed, with a ruffle of his hair, if he would bring David out and show him how to milk a cow like a man. Jed reluctantly consented and went out with David, while the farmer sat and waited on the porch with a delicious glass of warm milk from the previous morning.  Before long, David trudged back to the house and announced, “I think I know what’s wrong now, sir.”   “Well what is it?” asked the farmer, through a creamy mouthful of milk, beaming with admiration over David’s shoulder at Jed who was still vigorously milking.  David gestured behind him and said, “That’s a bull.”

1	We were at Kyle's place last week and had an idea You know how everyone has occasionally had the great idea to try and snort assorted things? Like pixie stix and rock candy? That's where this story takes place.  Somehow the topic of conversation wandered to the effects of cocaine and other substances on the nostrils. The attention seeker of the group, James, adamantly responded there's no way the actual activity of snorting could possibly harm your nose, and the destruction of the schnauzer was the fault of whatever substance was snorted.  Several members of the group challenged this, and back and forth ensued, until an agreement was reached. James would try it himself, without the substance part.  Issue was, the only consumable we had handy was fruit punch. The group began boiling down a small batch to be placed into a snortable less liquidy form. Credit cards were unsheathed, ready to swipe and manipulate the gooey substance into a snortable line. The scene was set and the challenge was nearing.  We all patiently awaited the punchline.

What can I do for you?” I said to the man, “well, I’m here on business and I saw you from over there and though, well that man must have some stories to tell. Have you been in this town long? Any interesting stories you got for me about this town and its history.”   “Well” replied the man “I’ve spent my whole life in this town as a laborer. You know that bridge you cross over to come into town? Well, I built that bridge with my bare hands but I was never considered a bridge builder. Ay, and that school right across the bridge with the beautiful brick? Well, I built that too! But I was never called a brick layer. However, you fuck one goat...”

Son: "Daddy, I have to write a special report for school, but I don't know what Politics is.”  Father: "Well, let's take our home as an example. I am the bread-winner, so let's call me Capitalism. Your Mum is the administrator of money, so we'll call her Government. We take care of your need, so let's call you The People.

A couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where Beethoven was buried.

Frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.    When the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "Ah, yes, that's Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, being played backwards."  He listened a while longer, and said, "There's the Eighth Symphony, and it's backward, too".   Most puzzling." So the magistrate kept listening; "There's the Seventh... the Sixth... the Fifth..."  Suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery,  "My fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. It's just Beethoven decomposing".

4	The pastor asked if anyone in the congregation would like to express praise for answered prayers.  A lady stood and walked to the podium.  She said, "I have a praise. Two months ago, my husband Tom had a terrible bicycle wreck, and his scrotum was completely crushed. The pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him."  You could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagined the pain that Tom must have experienced.  "Tom was unable to hold me or the children," she went on, "and every move caused him terrible pain. We prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of Tom's scrotum and wrap wire around it to hold it in place."  Again the men in the congregation were unnerved and squirmed uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on Tom.  "Now," she announced in a quavering voice, "thank the Lord Tom is out of the hospital, and the doctors say that with time his scrotum should recover completely."  All the men sighed with relief. The pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.  A man stood up and walked slowly to the podium.   He said "I'm Tom." The entire congregation held its breath..   "I just want to tell my wife that the word is sternum."

"Well, these shirts are on sale this week," declared the salesgirl.  "No, no quiero camisas. Quiero calcetines," repeated the man.  "I still don't know what you're trying to say. We have some fine pants on this rack," offered the salesgirl.  "No, no quiero pantalones. Quiero calcetines," insisted the man.  "These sweaters are top quality," the salesgirl probed.  "No, no quiero sueter. Quiero calcetines," said the man.  "Our undershirts are over here," fumbled the salesgirl, beginning to lose patience.  "No, no quiero camisetas. Quiero calcetines," the man repeated.  As they passed the underwear counter, the man spotted a display of socks and happily grabbed a pair. Holding them up he proclaimed, "Eso sí que es!"  "Why didn't you just spell it in the first place?!" yelled the salesgirl.

1	It could've been worse. James is walking on a downtown street one day, and he  happens to see his old high school friend, Harry, a little ways up  ahead. "Harry, Harry, how are you?" he greets his old buddy after  getting his attention.   "Not so good," says Harry.   "Why, what happened?" James queries.   "Well," Harry says, "I just went bankrupt and I've still got to feed my family. I don't know what I'm going to do."   "Could have been worse," James replies calmly. "Could have been worse."      A month or so later, James again encounters Harry, in a restaurant. "And how are things now?" he asks.   "Terrible!" says Harry. "Our house burned down last night."   "Could have been worse," says James, again with total aplomb, and goes about his business.  A month later, James runs into Harry a third time. "Well, how goes it?" he inquires.   "Oh!" says Harry. "Things just get worse and worse. It's one tragedy after another! Now my wife has left me!"   Harry nods his head and gives his usual optimistic-seeming little smile, accompanied by his usual words: "Could've been worse."      This  time, Harry grabs James by the shoulders. "Wait a minute!" he says.  "I'm not gonna let you off so easy this time. Three times in the past  few months we've run into one another, and every time I've told you the  latest disaster in my life. Every time you say the same thing: 'Could  have been worse.' This time, for God's sake, Harry, I want you to tell  me: how in Heaven's name could it have been any worse?"      James looks at Harry with the same little wisp of a smile. "Could have been worse," he says. "Could have happened to me."
2	There was an old man who lived by a forest. As he grew older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald. That day, he called his children to a meeting He said, "Look at my hair. It used to be so magnificent, but it's completely gone now. My hair can't be saved. But look outside at the forest. It's such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they'll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair."  "What I want you to do..." the man continued. "Is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. Tell your descendants to do the same. It shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong."  So they did.  Each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.  And for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.

The couple find themselves sitting outside the Pearly Gates waiting for St. Peter to process them into Heaven. While waiting, they begin to wonder: Could they possibly get married in Heaven? When St. Peter showed up, they asked him.  St. Peter said, 'I don't know. This is the first time anyone has asked. Let me go find out,' and he leaves.  The couple sat and waited, and waited. Two months passed and the couple are still waiting. While waiting, they began to wonder what would happen if it didn't work out; could you get a divorce in heaven. After yet another month, St. Peter finally returns, looking somewhat bedraggled.  'Yes,' he informs the couple, 'you can get married in Heaven.'  'Great!' said the couple, 'But we were just wondering, what if things don't work out? Could we also get a divorce in Heaven?'  St. Peter, red-faced with anger, slammed his clipboard onto the ground. 'What's wrong?' asked the frightened couple.  'OH, COME ON!', St. Peter shouted, 'It took me three months to find a priest up here! Do you have any idea how long it'll take me to find a lawyer ?

After being taken to the camp of these natives, the explorers were brought to the chief of the tribe.   He told the explorers. "For trespassing on land sacred to our people, you are to be killed and your skins turned into boats for travel across the waters. However, as a sign of respect I will let each of you choose the way you shall die so you may have some shred of dignity in death."

Smoke was filling the room and the children were coughing and panicking. He knew he had to act. Quick as a flash he took a long, deep breath and inhaled all of the smoke. He then opened the window and blew all of the smoke out of his lungs and into the air. He had saved his house and his family.

So the first guy comes back with a peach. The native american says "Shove it up your ass, if you laugh we kill you." So, he shoves the peach up his ass and he laughs, and the native americans kill him. The second guy comes back with a grape. The native american tells him the same thing. He laughs and the native american kills him. They both see each other in heaven and the first guy says to the second guy, "I had a peach and peaches are fuzzy so that's why I laughed, but you had a grape, what happened?" The second guy says, “Oh yeah I was doing just fine until I saw the other guy come back with a pineapple!”

1	[NSFW] Three sailors are on leave and get absolutely hammered... ...and are meandering around the port and decide that they’ve not gotten their whistles wetted in a while and start to ask around about where to find a good whore.  Before long they’re told, multiple times, about this amazing woman who gives amazing blow jobs, but also treats men to a song.  So the three drunk bastards set off and with the help of local scum, find her in no time.  The three sailors knock on the door and a small slit opens up revealing a gorgeous set of painted, ruby lips behind it, which informs the men of her rules:  * Payment up front  * It is to stay completely dark  * One man at a time  They eagerly agree and pay her through the slot in the door and soon the first two sailors are finished with the woman and sharing praise over her talents; “Oh lord she can suck cock like no ones business!” - “Holy shit can the woman sing!” And in a bit of drunken revelry the third one before he was to step inside jokes, “I bet your cocks are so small she could sing while doing yah!”  The other two men got meekly quiet, because it was true: she WAS singing as she was blowing them, and soon all the men were confused, and worried.  Upset about a possible trick or another possibility of deviance, they concocted a plan.  The third sailor comes in, is led to a couch where he’s sat down and the whore begins to perform on him and as she starts working the shaft of his penis, she begins to sing, so the third sailor shouts for his buddies who burst through the door, grab the poor woman and haul her outside to get her under a street lamp to talk to her so they can figure out what in the fuck was going on- but that ultimately wouldn’t be necessary as when the cadre got her into the light, they would all learn that she only had one eye.

The bartender described it to him. "First, you have to chug a fifth of Jack Daniel's in under 10 minutes. Second challenge, there's a polar bear outside with a rotting tooth. You have to go pull out it's tooth." The man cut him off and said "Jesus Christ dude! What's the third challenge?!" The bartender says, "the third challenge is you got to go to the shack behind the bar and have sex with the elderly eskimo woman until she orgasms." The man thinks about it and says he'll take the challenge. Bartender says, "Your fucking funeral." And hands him the bottle.

"Damn dude, you got some balls!" The bartender said. The man says in response, "Yeah dude, that was tough, but once I got into the motion of it, the bear calmed down. So wheres the old eskimo lady again?" The bartender told him and once again, he was off. The bartender laughed at the idea that someone might actually complete the challenge. He heard the old lady scream and thought, "Wow, he actually fucking did it." The guy comes in and drops something on the bar and proudly yet drunkenly says, "Final challenge complete! Here's the old hags tooth!"

1	Exercise for seniors  Just came across this exercise suggested for seniors, to build muscle strength in the arms and shoulders. It seems so easy, so I thought I'd pass it on to some of my younger friends. The article suggested doing it three days a week.  Begin by standing on a comfortable surface, where you have plenty of room at each side.  With a 5-lb. potato sack in each hand, extend your arms straight out from your sides, and hold them there as long as you can. Try to reach a full minute, then relax.  Each day, you'll find that you can hold this position for just a bit longer.  After a couple of weeks, move up to 10-lb. potato sacks.  Then 50-lb. potato sacks, and eventually try to get to where you can lift a 100-lb. potato sack in each hand and hold your arms straight for more than a full minute.  After you feel confident at that level, put a potato in each of the sacks; but be careful.

The priest thinking about what he said, nudged the drunk and apologised. “I'm sorry to come on so strong. How long have you had arthritis?”  “I don't have it, Father. I was just reading here that the Pope does.”

Get out of there!” He yelled and the family resumed eating.  The young man saw the opportunity and let out another small fart. Once again, the table went quiet. “Scruffy! Get out of there!” yelled the father. Soon eating resumed. Feeling safe the young man let the rest of the pent up gas slowly out.   This time, the father slammed down his napkin and yelled “Damnit Scruffy! Get out from under there before he kills you!”

2	The Wrong E-mail Address A couple from Minneapolis decided to go to Florida for a long weekend to thaw out during one particularly icy winter. They planned to stay at the very same hotel where they spent their honeymoon 20 years ago. Because both had jobs, they found it difficult coordinating their travel schedules. It was decided that the husband would fly to Florida on a Thursday, and his wife would follow him the next day. Upon arriving as planned, the husband checked into the hotel. In his room there was a computer, so he decided to send his wife an E-mail back in Minneapolis. However, he accidentally left out one letter in her address, and sent the e-mail without realizing his error. In Houston, a widow had just returned from her husband's funeral. The dearly departed was a minister of many years who had been called home to glory following a heart attack. The widow checked her e-mail, expecting messages from relatives and friends. Upon reading the first message, she fainted. The widow's son rushed into the room, found his mother on the floor, and saw the computer screen which read:  To: My Loving Wife Subject: I've Arrived.      I know you are surprised to hear from me. They have computers here now and you are allowed to send e-mail to your loved ones. I've just arrived and have been checked in. I see that everything has been prepared for your arrival tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then! Hope your journey is as uneventful as mine was.      P.S. Sure is hot down here

"Then if I start to lean to the right, she runs and props me back up with a pillow on my right side." "Hell, even if I lean back a little too far, she'll grab another pillow to stuff behind me." "And forget about leaning forward, she'll take another one and tucks it between my front legs!"  "Gee Dad, that doesn't sound like they're being too controlling. It just sounds like they're really being concerned for your comfort & safety."  "Bullsh*t! Then why won't they let me fart, when I have to??????"

2	Two boys were playing in the sandbox with a girl **This is a joke my grandpa just told me (he was a Navy guy).**  Two boys were playing in the sandbox with a girl; the boys’ names were Tom and Dick and the girl’s name was Sally.  Tom decided to challenge Sally to a contest. The rules of the contest were as follows: each child had to build up a pile of sand, sit their fannies on top of the pile, then break wind. Whoever blew the most sand off of their sand pile wins! Tom’s friend Dick would be the judge who decides that.  So both Tom and Sally build their own sand piles of equal size, they both sit on top of their sand piles, and both of them pass gas and blow off a lot of sand. Dick looks at the sand piles and goes, “Hmm...it’s hard to say who won this one. Let’s do a rematch!”  Then Tom and Sally made new sand piles of equal size and parked their fannies on top of their sand piles. Sally was able to blow almost all the sand off of her pile but Tom couldn’t pass any more gas no matter how hard he squeezed.  Dick was shocked as well, so he went over to Sally to investigate. He pulled up her skirt and removed her panties to take a look. His eyes widened, then he looked at Tom and said, “Well, no wonder, Tom! She’s double barreled!”

1	One evening, a family brings their frail, elderly mother to a nursing home and leaves her, hoping she will be well cared for. The next morning, the nurses bathe her, feed her a tasty breakfast, and set her in  a chair at a window overlooking a lovely flower garden.  She seems O.K. but after a while she slowly starts to lean over sideways  in her chair. Two attentive nurses immediately rush up to catch her  and straighten her up.  Again, she seems O.K. but after a while she starts to tilt to the other side.  The nurses rush back and once more bring her back upright. This goes  on all morning.

1	It's 1845 and a man travels to Montana with his wife and son to settle. (LONG) It's 1845 and Jacob travels to Montana with his wife and son to settle. After hard work, he has a log cabin built and pulls a brass bell from a steamer trunk they brought with them.   His wife, Sara, is bemused, asking what the bell is for. As the man proceeds to hang it from the eaves just in front of the front door, to one side, he answers her, replying, "It's our door bell." The family dog, DeeTee runs around and tries to get Caleb, the ten year old son, to play.   Jacob continues, "But it's more than a door bell. If you use the fire poker to hit it, it can be heard for a mile or more." He demonstrates and it is so loud  Sara and Caleb have to hold their ears. "If you have an emergency, and I am out hunting or felling timber, ring it like that and I will hop on my horse and come as fast as I can." he adds. Sarah is super pleased and that night, a new child is conceived.   Just a week later, Jacob is hunting small game when he hears the bell. He hops on his trusty horse and gallops home. When he enters the cabin, he sees Sarah cooking and Caleb playing with DeeTee. "What's the emergency, Sarah?" he asks breathlessly. She wipes her hands on her apron and casually answers, "Oh, nothing now. Caleb had a big splinter and I was having trouble with it. I figured we could use your help. But right after I rang the bell, he got it out. Sorry to bother you." Jacob was still catcjing his breath as he kissed her and restated the important detail that the bell was for emergencies only. She apologized and all was well.   Four months later, while fishing, Jacob heard the bell. He figured he made it clear it was for emergencies only, so this must surely be something horrible. Once again, he hurried home. This time, Caleb had skinned his knee, drawing blood, but it wasn't anything their medical supplies couldn't handle. This time, he just said, "Emergencies!" and returned to his fishing.  When Sarah was a month from her due date, Jacob was stalking a deer, wanting to have plenty of venison jerky on hand after the baby was born and he would be trying to spend more time at home. This time when the bell rang, he wasn't sure whether to rush home or not. Watching the deer bound away startled, he mounted the horse and hurried home, but not with the intensity he had garnered before.   As he came over the ridge, he could see his cabin in flames. As he rushed toward it, he saw his family dead in front of the cabin. DeeTee had an arrow through him. Caleb laid nearby, lifeless. On the porch, he saw Sarah directly under the bell in a pool of blood, scalped.   Jacob took a deep breath and said, "Well... thats more like it."

In fact, he's doing so well gave the last lady he was seeing a brand new sports car." Then he takes takes a swing and drives the ball down towards the green, and steps aside.  The third guy steps up and can't help but escalate with praise for his own son, "That's pretty impressive, but my boy is also doing great. He's a chip off the old block. He's a broker for luxury yachts, and really has a knack for it. He's doing so well that the last woman he was dating he up and just gave her a freaking boat!". He takes his shot and stands next to the other guy.  The last gentleman, growing in confidence steps up to the tee, really feeling pride in his son's accomplishments, "Those are nothing to scoff at, no doubt. Believe it or not though, my son is doing even better! He's a top ranked national realtor and had such a profitable year that he up and bought this girl he's been dating an entire freaking house!" He drives his shot almost to the hole and all three walk down to meet the friend that lost his ball in the trees.  The first guy chips his ball out as they arrive at the green. As he walks up the last guy shout to him, "What about you? You didn't say anything before you shot... don't you have something to share about your son?"   The bashfully dips his head a little and replies, "I don't understand my son. I love him and I'm happy he's happy. He's a cross-dresser, he's gay, and works as a male escort..." They all get quiet for a moment before he continues, "He must be good though - just this year his top clients have bought him a Ferarri, a small yacht, and a new fuckin' house!"

1	So I learned some interesting things today I get a kick out of words and word histories, so reading up I learned the word "CENTURION" came from the old Latin word for one hundred, because they were an officer in charge of one hundred soldiers.

It seemed like there was definitely some kind of joke or word play I could make out of that, but I couldn't find any.  There was no pun in ten dead.

2	The young woman who submitted the tech support message presumably did it as a joke. Then she got a reply that was way too good to keep to herself. The query: Dear Tech Support,  Last year I upgraded from Boyfriend 5.0 to Husband 1.0 and noticed a distinct slowdown in overall system performance, particularly in the flower and jewelry applications and intimacy, which operated flawlessly under Boyfriend 5.0. In addition, Husband 1.0 uninstalled many other valuable programs, such as Romance 9.5 and Personal Attention 6.5, and then installed undesirable programs such as: NBA 5.0, NFL 3.0 and Golf 4.1  Conversation 8.0 no longer runs, and House cleaning 2.6 simply crashes the system. Please note that I have tried running Nagging 5.3 to fix these problems, but to no avail. What can I do? Signed, DesperateBe careful of which tech support you choose.Love to AllMom/Grandma/ Ant Jody/Jo  The response (that came weeks later out of the blue):  Dear Desperate, First keep in mind, Boyfriend 5.0 is an Entertainment Package, while Husband 1.0 is an operating system. Please enter command: I thought you loved me.html and try to download Tears 6.2 Do not forget to install the Guilt 3.0 update. If that application works as designed, Husband 1.0 should then automatically run the applications Jewelry 2.0 and Flowers 3.5. However, remember, overuse of the above application can cause Husband 1.0 to default to Grumpy Silence 2.5, Happy Hour 7.0, or Beer 6.1.

2	An elderly man on a Moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to a doctor at a street light. The old man looks over at the sleek shiny car and asks, 'What kind of car ya got there, sonny?'  The doctor replies, “1500+hp Porsche 917/30. It cost half a million dollars!”  'That's a lot of money,' says the old man. 'Why does it cost so much?'  'Because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!' states the doctor proudly.  The Moped driver asks, 'Mind if I take a look inside?'  'No problem,' replies the doctor.  So the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.  Then, sitting back on his Moped, the old man says, 'That's a pretty nice car, all right... But I'll stick with my Moped!'  Just then the light changes, and the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do.  He floors it, and within 30 seconds  the speedometer reads 160 mph.  Suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. It seems to be getting closer!  He slows down to see what it could be and suddenly WHOOOOSSSHHH !  Something whips by him going much faster!  'What on earth could be going faster than my Porsche?' the doctor asks himself.  He presses harder on the accelerator  and takes the Porsche up to 250 mph.  Then, up ahead of him, he sees that it's the old man on the Moped!  Amazed that the Moped could pass his Porsche, he gives it more gas  and passes the Moped at 275 mph  and he's feeling pretty good until he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him AGAIN!  Astounded by the speed of this old guy, he floors the gas pedal and takes the sportscar all the way up to 320 mph.  Not ten seconds later, he sees the Moped bearing down on him again! The Porsche is flat out, and there's nothing he can do!  Suddenly, the Moped plows into the back of his Porsche, demolishing the rear end.  The doctor stops and jumps out and unbelievably the old man is still alive.  He runs up to the banged-up old guy and says, 'I'm a doctor.... Is there anything I can do for you?'  The old man whispers,  'Unhook my suspenders from your side view mirror!'.

'No, Father, that's what kind of fish it is - a Son of a B#tch fish!'  'Really? Well then, help me land this Son of a B#tch!'  Once in the boat, they marveled at the size of the monster.  'Father, that's the biggest Son of a B#tch I've ever seen'  'Yes, it is a big Son of a B#tch. What should I do with it?'  'Why, eat it, of course. You've never tasted anything as good as Son of a B#tch!'  Elated, the priest headed home to the rectory.  While unloading his gear and his prize catch, Sister Mary inquired about his trip.  'Take a look at this big Son of a B#tch I caught!'  Sister Mary gasped and clutched her rosary, 'Father!'  'It's OK, Sister. That's what kind of fish it is, a Son of a B#tch fish!'  'Oh, well then, what are you going to do with that big Son of a B#tch?'  Sister Mary informed the priest that the new Bishop was scheduled to visit in a few days and that they should fix the Son of a B#tch for his dinner.  'I'll even clean the Son of a B#tch', she said.  As she was cleaning the huge fish, the Friar walked in.  'What are you doing Sister?'  'Father wants me to clean this big Son of a B#tch for the new Bishop's Dinner'  'Sister! I'll clean it if you're so upset! Please watch your language!'  'No, no, no, it's called a Son of a B#tch Fish.'  'Really? Well, in that case, I'll fix up a great meal to go with it, and that Son of a B#tch can be the main course!  Let me know when you've finished cleaning that Son of a B#tch.'  On the night of the new Bishop's visit, everything was perfect. The Friar had prepared an excellent meal. The wine was fine, and the fish was excellent.  The new Bishop said, 'This is great fish, where did you get it?'  'I caught that Son of a B#tch!' proclaimed the proud priest.  'And I cleaned the Son of a B#tch!' exclaimed the Sister.  The Friar added, 'And I prepared the Son of a B#tch, using a special recipe!  The new Bishop looked around at each of them. A big smile crept across his face as he said, 'You mother f---ers are my kind of people!'

1	That'll do it   After having their 11th child, a redneck couple decided that was enough. They could not afford a larger house so the husband went to his doctor (who also treated mules) and told him that he and his wife/ cousin didn’t want to have any more children.   The doctor told him that there was a procedure called a vasectomy that could fix the problem.   The doctor instructed him to go home, get a cherry bomb (small firework), light it, put it in a beer can, then hold the can up to his ear and count to 10.   The redneck said to the doctor, “I may not be the smartest man but I don’t see how putting a cherry bomb in a beer can next to my ear is going to help me.”   So, the couple drove to get a second opinion. The second doctor was just about to tell them about the medical procedure for a vasectomy, when he realized how truly backward these people were. This doctor instead told him to go home and get a cherry bomb, light it, place it in a beer can, hold it to his ear and count to 10.   Figuring that both physicians couldn’t be wrong, the man went home, lit a cherry bomb and put it in a beer can. He held the can up to his ear and began to count “1...2...3...4...5...” at which point he paused, placed the beer can between his legs and resumed counting on his other hand...

A pacific island tribal king was infamous for conquering surrounding islands and stealing the defeated king’s throne, and then stowing it, like a trophy, in the attic of his grass hut.

"I'm learning a lot about sexuality, becoming less inhibited and satisfying my own desires" she continues. "This book also dispels a lot of common myths, stereotypes and misconceptions"       “Really” the man utters, swallowing hard. “And what myths might those be?”  The blonde pauses, and in a hushed tone begins; “The most common myth is that African Men are the most well endowed, when in fact it's Native American Men who actually posses that physical trait"  "Really?" the man stutters his reply, "what... what else does it say?"  "Well" she says, lightly licking her lips, "another common stereotype is the French are the most passionate lovers, when in fact it's the Irish man who really knows how to make a woman's body respond"  "That's... fascinating" the man struggles to respond ... "Anything else?"  "Well, the most surprising thing to me was the misconception that Italian men have the most stamina in bed" she whispers, wriggling in her seat. "When it's actually Rural American Men who can perform repeatedly and for hours on end"   Suddenly, the woman becomes flushed and breathlessly says "I'm so embarrassed, here I am discussing something so provocative and erotic and I don’t even know your name....”  The man quickly extends his hand and replies;   “My name is Tonto"   "Tonto O'Reilly"   "But my Friends call Me Bubba"

A few moments later I heard screams, looked up, and saw the DEA officer running for his life, being chased by my big old mean bull. With every step the bull was gaining on him, it seemed likely that the officer would get hired before he reached safety. The officer was clearly terrified.   I threw down my tools, ran to the fence, and yelled at the top of my lungs... “Your badge! Show him your fucking badge!!”

I would gladly walk you there, but I can't carry this lot." “Why don't you put the can of paint in the bucket,” suggested the little old lady, “carry the bucket in one hand, put a chicken under each arm and carry the goose in your other hand?' “Why, thank you very much,” he said and proceeded to walk the old girl home. On the way he said. “'Let's take my short cut and go down this alley. We'll be there in no time.” The little old lady looked him over cautiously then said, “I am a lonely widow without a husband to defend me. How do I know that when we get in the alley you won't hold me up against the wall, pull up my skirt, and have your way with me?” “Holy smokes lady!”, the farmer said. “I'm carrying a bucket, a gallon of paint, two chickens, and a goose. How in the world could I possibly hold you up against the wall and do that?” “Well,” the old lady replied,  “Set the goose down, cover him with the bucket, put the paint on top of the bucket, and I'll hold the chickens.”

1	One of my favorites for my first cake day A wealthy, but stingy father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 18 y/o daughter.  He wanted the party to be extravagant, but wanted to spend as little money as possible. He had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.  "Why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  So the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *My daughter is inviting all of her friends, and I'll look bad if I don't put together a good cake*, he thought. Then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.  *How quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  He was met by a Buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "Hello," the father asked, "I would like to buy a cake."  "Of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  The father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  The day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. All of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  The monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "Why do you do this for free? You should take money for your services!"  The monk smiled and said, "I do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."

1	The Doctor is Always Right A man wakes up feeling sick, so he goes to an urgent care center.  The doctor asks what his symptoms are, and he tells her, "I'm not sure - I'm just not right."  The doctor immediately replies, "I need a urine specimen."  The man is taken aback.  "Why do you need a urine sample?  You haven't even examined me!"  The doctor points to a computer in the corner of her office and explains, "We're trying to reduce the cost of health care, so we've got this new system that can diagnose any medical condition with just a urine sample."  The man is skeptical, but he reluctantly goes into the bathroom, pees into the cup and brings it back to the examination room.  His doctor pours the specimen into a funnel connected to the computer, pushes a button and waits a few seconds.  Out pops a small piece of paper.  She looks at it and tells him, "Says here you've got tennis elbow."  The man gets furious.  "That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard!  Your computer isn't worth a damn.  I want a second opinion."  The doctor says, "Well, okay.  We're still working out the kinks.  Take this vial home and bring me a new specimen tomorrow.  I'll run it through again, no charge."  So the man drives home, getting angrier by the minute.  He decides to fuck with the system.  First, he gives his teenage daughter the vial and says, "Pee a little in here."  She does.  Next, he gives the vial to his wife and says, "Pee a little more in here."  She does.  Then he goes into the garage, crawls under his car, loosens the crankcase plug and adds a few drops of oil to the specimen.  Finally, he whips out his dick and masturbates into the cup.  The next morning he returns to the urgent care center and smugly hands the vial to his doctor.  She pours the contents into the funnel and pushes the button.  Out pops another slip of paper.  She looks at the results and tells him, "Your daughter's pregnant, your wife has the clap, your car needs an oil change, and if you don't quit jerking off, you'll never get over that tennis elbow!"

1	Clocks, Trump, and Heaven A guy dies and goes to heaven. It's a slow day for St. Peter, so, upon passing the entrance test, St. Peter says, "I'm not very busy today, why don't you let me show you around?" The guy thinks this is a great idea and graciously accepts the offer. St. Peter shows him all the sights, the golf course, the reading room, the library, the observatory, the cafeteria and finally, they come to a HUGE room filled with clocks. The guy asks, "What's up with all these clocks?" St. Peter explains, "Everyone on earth has a clock that shows how much time he has left on earth. When a clock runs out of time, the person dies and comes to the Gates to be judged." The guy thinks this makes sense but notices some of the clocks are running faster than others. He asks why this is? St. Peter explains, "Every time a living person tells a lie, it speeds up his clock." This also makes sense, so the guy takes one last look around the room before he leaves and notices one clock in the center of the ceiling. On this clock, both hands are spinning at an unbelievable rate. So he asks, "What's the story with that clock?" "Oh, that," St. Peter replies, "That's Donald Trump’s clock. We decided to use it as a ceiling fan."

I saw how he kissed your neck. If he wants sex, don't resist, don't complain... do whatever he tells you.  Satisfy him no matter how much he nauseates you. This guy is obviously very dangerous. If he gets angry, he'll kill us both. Be strong, honey. I love you!"  His wife responds: "He wasn't kissing my neck. He was whispering in my ear. He told me that he's gay, thinks you're cute, and asked if we had any Vaseline. I told him it was in the bathroom. Be strong honey. I love you, too!"

2	The Husband Store A new store that sells new husbands has opened in New York City , where a woman may go to choose a husband. Among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:  You may visit this store ONLY ONCE! There are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. The shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!  So, a woman goes to the Husband Store to find a husband. On the first floor the sign on the door reads:  Floor 1 - These men Have Jobs.  She is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:  Floor 2 - These men Have Jobs and Love Kids.  "That's nice," she thinks, "but I want more." So she continues upward. The third floor sign reads:  Floor 3 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, and are Extremely Good Looking.  "Wow," she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. She goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:  Floor 4 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Good Looking and Help With Housework.  "Oh, mercy me!" she exclaims, "I can hardly stand it!" Still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:  Floor 5 - These men Have Jobs, Love Kids, are Drop-dead Gorgeous, Help with Housework, and Have a Strong Romantic Streak.  She is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:  Floor 6 - You are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. There are no men on this floor. This floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. Thank you for shopping at the Husband Store.  PLEASE NOTE:  To avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a New Wives store just across the street.  The first floor has wives that love sex.  The second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.  The third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.

1	The path to inner peace begins with just 3 words Not my problem
3	A really annoying loophole A bus carrying many people crashed on an icy road, burst into flames, and everyone died. Upon arrival in heaven, God said, "Since you have died in a terrible way, I'll grant you one wish before I let you into heaven." The first woman, being a person always concerned on her looks, comes up to God and says "I wish to be beautiful." God grants her wish. The next person can’t decide on what to wish for, so he ends up wishing for the same thing. At this point a man at the very back of the line starts to laugh. The next couple, seeing how utterly wondrous the two have become, make their wish to become beautiful also, and the man at the end laughs even louder. One after another, the people wish for the same thing. The closer God gets to the end of the line, the harder the man laughs. When God finally reaches him, he asks "What is your wish my son?" The man says, "Make them all ugly again!"

2	True story but funny. While filling my car up i noticed a woman smoking while filling her car up, silly thing to do but I know better than to confront strangers about their stupidity.    I see 2 cops on the other side of the street, they can see her but they aren't doing anything about it... tax dollars in action I guess.    As I am going to pay I hear this screaming behind me, like "I am dying" type screaming. I look around and see that this womans arm is on fire! She is literally running around the station waving her arm in the air! The cops jump into action and put the fire out, then arrest and handcuff her!    I think this is a bit harsh and that the woman should be going to the hospital, not jail so I ask one cop why are they arresting her.    The cop replied, "For waving a firearm in public"

1	A group of soldiers are walking in the woods, lost and in need of shelter After hours they stumble across an old shack, with smoke coming out of it. The leader goes inside to check and hopefully find someone who can help them. Inside is an old woman, all dirty. The man explains their situation and she makes a deal with him. She says: “I haven’t had a good fucking in a long time, If one of you men can satisfy me, I’ll make you all dinner and breakfast, and you can sleep under my roof tonight.” They debate who’ll do it, when one man steps up. She walks him inside as the rest of the men sit against the cot, to wait. She undressed and turns off the light when the man sees a corn on the cob, a couple of them, in the corner of her little bedroom. He thinks to himself and realizes that she won’t notice the difference, so he uses that to fuck her, she was dirty and old anyway. She loves it and when she turns the lights back on he chucks it out of the window. She says if he’ll do it again, she’ll feed them for a week! So, he repeats his steps, using the corn on the cob, then ditching it. He then goes outside to see his friends leaning against the building. He starts to tell them the good news when he notices they’re all passing around and eating two corn on the cobs.  “Ay! Thanks for the corn!! Delicious! You want a bite?”  Hope you enjoyed the joke! My second post ever on Reddit, hope I did well!

I always say the same things over and over!"  The driver agrees: "You're right. As your driver, I attended all of them, and even though I don't know anything about science, I could give the conference in your place."   "That's a great idea!" says Einstein. "Let's switch places then!"   So they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as Einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real Einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.   But in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask Einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. So this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. The whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.   The driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :   "Sir, your question is so easy to answer that I'm going to let my driver reply to it for me."

The man decided, "What the hell, I'll try it," He spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it before he got home to his wife. He couldn't do it in his office. He thought about the restroom, but that was too open. He considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe. Finally, he realized his solution. On his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highway. He got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck. Satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to play with his unit. He closed his eyes and thought of his lover. As he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants. Not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, "What?" He heard, "This is the police. What's going on down there?" The man replied, "I'm checking out the rear axle, it's busted." The cop replied, "Well, you might as well check your brakes too while you're down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago."

1	A nun and a priest were crossing the Sahara desert on a camel On the third day out the camel suddenly dropped dead without warning.  After dusting themselves off, the nun and the priest surveyed their situation.  After a long period of silence, the priest spoke.  “Well sister, this looks pretty grim.”  “I know, father.” “In fact, I don’t think it likely that we can survive more than a day or two.”  “I agree.” “Sister, since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive, would you do something for me?”  “Anything father.”  “I have never seen a woman’s breasts and I was wondering if I might see yours.”  “Well, under the circumstances I don’t see that it would do any harm.”  The nun opened her habit and the priest enjoyed the sight of her shapely breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty.  “Sister would you mind if I touched them?”  She consented and he fondled them for several minutes.  “Father, could I ask something of you?”  “Yes sister?” “I have never seen a man’s penis. Could I see yours?”  “I supposed that would be OK,” the priest replied lifting his robe.  “Oh father, may I touch it?”  This time the priest consented and after a few minutes of fondling he was sporting a huge erection.  “Sister, you know that if I insert my penis in the right place, it can give life.”  “Is that true father?”  “Yes it is, sister.”  “Then stick it up that camel’s ass and let's get the fuck out of here.”
1	Ice fishing I was in Greenland a few years ago and I wanted to try ice fishing.  So I went to the local sporting goods store to purchase everything I would need, an ice saw, fishing pole, line, hooks, and a bucket to hold my catch.  I drove out to the ice lake, cut a hole in the ice, and got set up.  I had been there about an hour when another guy set up a fishing hole about 20 yards away from me.  I hadn't caught a thing, but as soon as he set his line in the water, he caught a fish.  This continued every five minutes he'd throw in his line, he'd catch another fish.  Finally, after 2 hours of nothing, I decided to go over and ask him what his secret was.    He responded "mmmfff to dmakd the mmmf fmmm".    I told him I didn't understand, and he said again "mmmfff to dmakd the mmmf fmmm".    I told him I still didn't understand him, so he cupped his hands under his mouth, spit into them, and said "You have to keep your worms warm."

2	An Irish man moves to a small town An Irishman moves into a tiny hamlet in County Kerry, walks into the pub and promptly orders three beers. The bartender raises his eyebrows, but serves the man three beers, which he drinks quietly at a table, alone. An hour later, the man has finished the three beers and orders three more. This happens yet again. The next evening the man again orders and drinks three beers at a time, several times. Soon the entire town is whispering about the man who orders three beers.  Finally a week later, the bartender broaches the subject on behalf of the town, “I don't mean to pry, but folks around here are wondering why you always order three beers? "Tis odd isn't it?" the man replies. "You see, I have two brothers, and one went to America, and the other to Australia. We promised each other that we would always order an extra two beers whenever we drank as a way of keeping up the family bond.. The bartender and the whole town were pleased with this answer.  Then one day, the man comes in and orders only two beers. The bartender pours them with a heavy heart. This continues for the rest of the evening. Each time he orders only two beers. The word flies around the town. Prayers are offered for the soul of one of the brothers. The next day the bartender says to the man, "Folks around here, me first of all, want to offer condolences to you for the death of your brother. You know the two beers instead of three and all. The man ponders this for a moment then replies, "You'll be happy to hear that my two brothers are alive and well. It's just that I myself have decided to give up drinking."

2	Oh Grandpa An out-of-breath 7 year-old girl ran up to her grandfather, who was tinkering in his workshop, and confronted him with the universally dreaded (by adults) question, “What is sex…?”  He was surprised she’d ask such a question at her age, but thought if she’s old enough to ask, she’s old enough to get a straight answer. He wouldn’t shirk his responsibility.  Steeling himself to leave nothing out, he proceeded to describe for her all the variations of human sexuality he could conjure, careful to impress upon her the joys and responsibilities of intercourse and procreation.  When finally Grandpa was done pontificating, the little girl stood frozen, as though nailed to the spot, and looked at him with her mouth open, eyes wide in amazement.  Seeing she was overwhelmed, he asked what caused her sudden curiosity.   His granddaughter shook off her reverie and replied, “Grandma says dinner will be ready in a couple of secs.”

The penis exclaims," That's nothing! My life is by far the worst! When I get big and hard they put a plastic bag over my head, stick me in a dark room and bang my head against the wall until I puke and pass out!!!"

Says, "Bartender, I got me a bet for you. I'm gonna bet you $300 that I can piss into that glass over there and not spill a single, solitary drop." The bartender looks. I mean, we're talking, like, this glass is like a good ten feet away. He says, "Now wait, let me get this strait. You're tryin' to tell me you'll bet me $300 that you can piss, standing over here, way over there into that glass, and not spill a single drop?" Customer looks up and says, "That's right."

You just lost $300, idiot!" The guy says, "Well, see those guys over there? I just bet them $500 a piece that I could piss on your bar, piss on your floor, piss on your phone, and piss on you, and not only would you not be mad about it, you'd be happy."

1	2 Old Farmers Two old farmers have each 1 big meadow and only 1 sheep.  One farmer proposes to remove the fence between their meadows because the sheep are both lonely. The second farmer agrees, however he wonders how they could tell which sheep belongs to whom.   The first farmer comes up with the idea to cut off 1 leg of his sheep, so the 3 legged-sheep is always gonna be his, and the 4-legged belongs to the second farmer. At nightfall they come to an agreement.  The next morning the 4-legged sheep wakes the 3-legged sheep up.   \\-" Hey Buddy, Hey Buddy !!" he says enthusiastically " We are finally together! Wanna go racing ?!"  \\*"Sure buddy, but it's not gonna be a fair race, you have 4 legs and I only have 3"  \\-"Hmm, let me think... What if I bite of my leg, then we are even and can race all day."  \\*" Good idea, lets race!"  So the 4-legged sheep bites off a leg and also becomes a 3-legged sheep, they race all day and have a A hell of a lot of fun.  At dusk the two farmers stroll around their meadows and to their suprise they find their sheep both with 3 legs. "Sigh, let me just cut off another leg so I have the 2-legged sheep and you have the 3-legged" says the first farmer. The second farmer agrees, and they head back to their farms.  The next morning the 3-legged sheep wakes the 2 legged sheep up.  \\-" Hey Buddy, Hey Buddy !!" he says enthusiastically  "  Wanna go racing again?!"  \\*"Sure buddy, but it's not gonna be a fair race, you have 3 legs and I only have 2."  \\-"Guess, I'll have to bite off another leg, so we can race all day."  \\*"Good idea, lets go race all day again."  The 3-legged sheep bites off another leg, both are now 2-legged sheep and race all day and have a hell of a lot of fun.  Again around dusk the two farmer stroll around their meadows and AGAIN to their suprise they find their sheep both with 2 legs. A bit aggravated the first farmer cutts of both legs, and claims the legless sheep. The second farmer agrees again and they head back to their farms.  The next morning the 2-legged sheep wakes  the legless sheep up.  \\-" Hey Buddy, Hey Buddy !!" he says enthusiastically  "  Wanna go racing again?!"  \\*"I'd love to but I don't have anymore legs, I don't think I can race ever again."  \\-"Nonsens" the 2-legged sheep says " I'll just bite off my 2 remaining legs, so we are both legless sheep, we can race around all day like caterpillars"  \\*"Okay buddy, great idea, sounds like fun"  The 2-legged sheep bites off both his legs and they race all day like caterpillars, and boy do they have a hell of a lot of fun again.  Again at dusk, the farmers take their daily evening stroll, to their suprise they find both their sheep legless. Desperately, they try to come up with idea's on how to tell which sheep belongs to whom.  Untill the first farmer says : " Look, let me just take the Black sheep, you can have the white one"

Finally, a boy in the back raises his hand and says in a timid voice, "If an aeroplane carrying you, Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton, Mike Pence, Boris Johnson, Theresa May and Jacob Rees-Mogg was blown up by a bomb, that would be a tragedy."  "Wonderful!" beams Trump. "And can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?"  "Well", says the boy, "Because it wouldn't be an accident, and it certainly wouldn't be a great loss!"

1	Priest and the Camera  Twice a week the local parish priest liked to go up on the roof of the rectory and crank one out. He had decided that this was probably the most discreet and secure place he could be and not be discovered. One day a tourist on a nearby tower was taking pictures of the city landscape and noticed the priest pleasuring himself, He quickly took a number of pictures. The next day he went to the church and asked to see the Priest. The priest's secretary introduced them and they went back to his office to talk. He asked the Priest if he was interested in photography because he might have a really nice camera for sale. The Priest replied that he was not that interested at which point the man laid out several 8x10 glossy prints of the Priest in all his glory vigorously choking the chicken. "Any interest now?" the man exclaimed. "How much?" the Priest asked embarrassingly, "$5000", the man replied, and the Priest begrudgingly paid the money and put the camera up on a shelf behind him. Later that day the secretary came into the office to ask a question when she noticed the camera. "That's a nice camera father, I didn't even know you were into photography. Do you mind me asking how much you paid for it?", "$5000" the Priest replied. "Wow!", she responded, "they must have seen you coming!"

2	A young woman visits a florist to get some flowers for her mother. As she's perusing, she notices the most gorgeous rose she's ever seen sitting next to the cashier, and asks for its price.   "Oh, sorry," the cashier replies. "That one's not for sale. I got that as a gift from a fellow florist for hooking him up with a woman I met yesterday."   "Yesterday?!" she gasps. "How did they hit it off so quickly?"   "Well, he's a handsome man, a really nice guy, and apparently a wonderful lover. And to top it off," he says, leaning into a whisper, "I hear he's got a *10-inch cock!"*   She giggles, blushing. "Sounds like quite the catch! Where can I find him?"   "He's just a block over. But fair warning...he's also a little...*kooky.* He's only interested in women named after flowers. So if I ever meet a woman with a flowery name, I send her his way."   He points at the rose. "Then, he sends me a flower as a thank you. Yesterday was Rose. A week ago, I recommended Violet to him," he says, indicating a slightly wilted violet in a vase behind him.   The woman thanks him and leaves, bitterly cursing her own name. Undeterred, she visits the well-endowed florist's shop. Stepping up to the counter, she pointedly inquires, "I heard you are particularly...*skilled*... in certain areas?"   He smirks. "So I have been told. And who might you be?"   Her heart skips a beat at his sexy accent. "I was referred by your friend down the street. Perhaps you can...assist me?"   "Perhaps," he says, "but tell me...what is your name?"   She hesitates. Then, pouting slightly, she replies "Kristen. But everyone calls me Kris."   His smile falters, and his head sinks as he shakes his head. Kris's heart drops, knowing she's blown her chance.   "Well then...if it's not too much trouble, I'd like some flowers for my mother."   "Of course," he sighs, turning towards his menagerie of bouquets behind glass. "What kind of flowers does...she...."   Suddenly, without another word, he locks the shop door, swoops upon her, and takes her into his arms.   Three hours of mind-altering orgasms later, she bids him goodbye with a kiss, as he presents a complimentary bouquet for her mother.   "And please," he says, "tell your sweet mama she is welcome to as many flowers from my shop as she would like."   Flustered with ecstasy, she promises to convey the message, and calls her mother that night to tell her everything.   The next day, Kris feels incredible, and stops by the original florist's shop.   "I just wanted to thank you for telling me about that dashing gentleman! He was AMAZING!"   He smiles sheepishly. "I suppose I should thank you too. I just got another beautiful flower for recommending you to him."   "Really? What flower could he have possibly sent that was named after me?"   The florist sighs. "Chrysanthemum."

1	Little Johnny has the foulest mouth in his first grade class All the teachers at the school know this. One day, a teacher starts teaching her class the alphabet.  She says, "Class, who can give me a word that starts with the letter A?"  Little Johnny raises his hand, but the teacher knows Johnny is going to use a swear word, so she picks someone else.  "Billy, how about you? What's a word that starts with the letter A?"   Billy says "Apple. A is for apple."   "Very good Billy. Now, who can give me a word that starts with the letter B?"  Little Johnny raises his hand again, but the teacher knows hes gonna say a dirty word, so she picks someone else.  "Susie, how about you? Can you tell us a word that starts with the letter B?"  Susie says "Ball. B is for ball. A big red one."  The teacher says, "Very good, Susie. You also had an extra B word in there with the use of the word Big. How about the letter C? Who has a word for the letter C?"   Little Johnny of course raises his hand again and the teacher expects him to say a really naughty word, so she picked someone else again.   "Tommy, can you please give the class an example of a word that starts with the letter C?"   Tommy says, "Cat. C is for a crazy cat, who uses his claws to catch mice."  The teacher says "Excellent, Tommy! You also gave bonus words with the letter C. For that, you get a gold star today!"  She goes through the alphabet, asking the class to name words for wach letter, and on each one, little Johnny raised his hand every time but the teacher skipped him because she knows that Johnny knows every cuss word in the book.  She finally gets to the letter R and asks the class to give an example, but little Johnny is the only one who raised his hand.  She thinks, *I honestly cant think of a dirty word that starts with the letter R, so alright...*  "Johnny.....do you have a nice clean word for the class that starts with the letter R?"  Johnny says "Yes. Rats!" "BIG FUCKING RATS WITH ENORMOUS BALLS AND COCKS THAT ARE THREE FEET LONG!!"
3	The Smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. On the day the proxy father was to arrive, Mr. Smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, "Well, I'm off now. The man should be here soon."  Half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale.  "Good morning, Ma'am", he said, "I've come to..."  "Oh, no need to explain," Mrs. Smith cut in, embarrassed, "I've been expecting you."  "Have you really?" said the photographer. "Well, that's good. Did you know babies are my specialty?"  "Well that's what my husband and I had hoped. Please come in and have a seat "  After a moment she asked, blushing, "Well, where do we start?"  "Leave everything to me. I usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. And sometimes the living room floor is fun. You can really spread out there."  "Bathtub, living room floor? No wonder it didn't work out for Harry and me!"  "Well, Ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. But if we try several different positions and I shoot from six or seven angles, I'm sure you'll be pleased with the results."  "My, that's a lot!" gasped Mrs. Smith.  "Ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. I'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but I'm sure you'd be disappointed with that."  "Don't I know it," said Mrs. Smith quietly.  The photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. "This was done on the top of a bus," he said.  "Oh my God!" Mrs. Smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.  "And these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider her mother was so difficult to work with."  "She was difficult?" asked Mrs. Smith.  "Yes, I'm afraid so. I finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. People were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look."  "Four and five deep?" said Mrs. Smith, her eyes wide with amazement.  "Yes", the photographer replied. "And for more than three hours, too. The mother was constantly squealing and yelling - I could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached I had to rush my shots. Finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, I just had to pack it all in."  Mrs. Smith leaned forward. "Do you mean they actually chewed on your, um... equipment?"  "It's true, Ma'am, yes. Well, if you're ready, I'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away."  "Tripod?"  "Oh yes, Ma'am. I need to use a tripod to rest my Canon on. It's much too heavy to be held in the hand very long."  With that, Mrs. Smith fainted.

1	An inventor is about to pass, leaving all he has to his only family. His two children. He was a very altruistic person in life, only using his inventions to help people and not make any profit. His daughter admired this trait and followed this path becoming a tinkerer herself. His son, however, was an opportunist. He would always attempt to make a profit off any of his father's inventions, but would be shut down quickly. This meant that all his father had to his name was his workshop. On his death bed he tells his children that he has a secret invention he was developing on the side lines. He then proposed the choice for them.     "All I have is my stuffy workshop with a few tools to my name, but in the attic is an invention I was working on for years. I finally completed it last week, but kept it for our family."     "It's our personal legacy!" He proclaimed.  The inventor gave them the option right there as he wrote his dying will, the workshop, or his legacy invention? Without skipping a beat, the son called for dibs on the invention. The daughter sighed but decided to avoid any conflict and chose to claim the workshop. The son immediately leaves as his father rambles on, setting up meetings with local investors and patent agents about an invention so great that his father would hand it down to him as a family legacy!     Later that night the inventor died. The funeral came and went as did the will hearing. Each of the children received a key. The daughter, a key for the front door and the son, an ornate key that he had not seen before. The son immediately demanded his sister open the workshop, that he may claim his legacy. She obliged and he rushed in. Other than obvious junk and half repaired toys in the attic, there were a pair of long boxes chained together by a gaudy lock. He grabbed the boxes and left the shop.   He called an auction with the many executives he attempted to sell his fathers' previous inventions to where they can witness the unboxing of one so great that he would brand it as his legacy.     The son slips the key into the lock, it doesn't work... at first, but turns it again and the lock snaps open. He puts one of two boxes on the table. Everyone leans in as he gently opens the box. Finally, he thought, his father's final invention would be the one to make him rich.     He lifts the invention out the box and everyone's excitement turned into confusion. The legacy he left was nothing more than a thigh high stocking strapped with dozens of fans and heat sinks. Laughter erupts among the executives ad the son panics, looking for something else in the box. He finds a small sheet of paper folded up, it read - Instructions for use and care for your personal leg A/C .
1	A farmer wakes up to discover that his precious Alpine goat had died overnight. Since he loved that goat very deeply, he decided to jump into the river by his house and commit suicide. Soon after, his wife woke up, and discovered his note. She too, followed in his steps and jumped into the river.   Their younger son woke up to find both of his parents dead, and seeing no purpose to live, he too jumped into the river. However, a mermaid hoists him up, and makes him an offer, "If you can make love to me 20 times in a row, I'll resurrect your family. However, if you fail to do that, I'll eat you."   The young boy agrees, and tries his best. However, after the 5th time, he faints and the mermaid eats him. At noon, the older son of the farmer wakes up and finds his family dead. When he walks up to the river and sees his brother's remains, the mermaid again jumps out of the water, and makes him the same offer.   Grinning, he asks the mermaid, "What if you died due to all that sex?"   Surprised by his confidence, the mermaid replies,       " You really think you can make love to me 20 times?" "How else do you think the goat died?"
