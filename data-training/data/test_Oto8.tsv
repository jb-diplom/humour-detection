didn't like shopping there anyway yesterday i was at my local tesco’ store buying a large bag of winalot dog food for my loyal pet and was in the checkout queue when a woman behind me asked if i had a dog.  what did she think i had, an elephant? on impulse i told her that no, i didn't have a dog, i was starting the winalot diet again.   i added that i probably shouldn'’t, because i ended up in hospital last time, but i'd lost 2 stone before i woke up in intensive care with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and ivs in both arms.  i told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with winalot nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. the food is nutritionally complete so it works well and i was going to try it again. (i have to mention here that practically everyone in queue was now enthralled with my story.)  horrified, she asked me if i ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. i told her no, i stepped off the kerb to sniff an irish setter's arse and a car hit me.  i thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard.   i'm now banned from tesco.	7

"you see, my back yard is right next to a golf course. a lot of golfers come and pee through a knot hole in my fence, right into my flower garden. it used to really tick me off. kills the flowers, you know. then i thought, 'why not make the best of it?'   so, now, i stand behind the fence by the knot hole, real quiet, with my hedge clippers. every time some guy sticks his thing through my fence, i surprise him, grab hold of it and say, 'o.k., buddy! give me $20, or off it comes.'   "well, that seems only fair," said the cop, laughing. "ok. good luck! oh, by the way, what's in the other bag?"   "not everybody pays."	8

a couple wants to have sex but their 8 year old son named timmy is in the house.. a couple wants to have sex but their 8 year old son named timmy is in the house. to get him out of the house, they give him an ice pop and they tell him to sit on the front porch and shout out everything that he sees while they try to pull a quickie. timmy starts to point everything out.   “mailman stopped by.” timmy says.   “the andersons are getting new furniture” he calls out.   “jacob got a new bike.”  “oh look. kevin’s parents are having sex.” timmy says.    the dad shouts out from the bedroom, “how do you know they’re having sex?”   timmy replies “he’s sitting out on the front porch with a popsicle.”  edit: it blows my mind how many people are saying things like “repost” and “karma whore” when i literally joined this sub just to post this joke after hearing it irl. i also barely post on reddit and could not care less about my karma	8

a manchester united fan, liverpool fan and an everton fan were caught drinking in saudi arabia.... an everton fan, a liverpool fan and a manchester united fan were all in saudi arabia drinking a smuggled crate of booze.  all of a sudden saudi police rushed in and arrested them.  for their punishment the saudi arabia sheik decided that the punishment should be 20 lashes with a whip.  as they were preparing for their punishment, the sheik suddenly said: "it is my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping."  the manchester united fan was first in line (he had consumed the least), so he thought about it for a while and then said: "please tie a pillow to my back."  this was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes before the whip went through it.  the manchester united fan had to be carried away bleeding and crying when the punishment was done.  the liverpool fan was next up (he almost finished a half-keg), and after watching the scene, said: "choice! please fix two pillows on my back."  but even two pillows could only take 15 lashes before the whip went through again.  the everton fan was the last one up (he had finished off the keg), but before he could say anything, the sheikh turned to him and said: "you are from a most beautiful part of england, your city has some of the best and most loyal football fans in the world. for this, you may have two wishes!"  "cheers mate, your most royal and merciful highness", the everton fan replied.  "in recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes."  "not only are you an honorable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave." the sheik said with an admiring look on his face.  "if 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. and your second wish? what is it to be?" the sheik asked.  "tie that liverpool fan to my back..."	6

a woman makes a deal with the devil to gain wealth and power, but doesn't want to go to hell. the devil makes a little rule for the woman. she happily agrees and thus, the contract is sealed.  she goes onto be the best stockbroker in her city, giving her a near bottomless checkbook and connections to lawmakers, celebrities, anyone with even a scrap of power in the city.   almost 15 years later, the woman stops by a church, and invites the reverend to a dinner at her penthouse. after that, she invites a schoolteacher, an orphanage director, a mechanic, and a psychiatrist.   after dinner, the woman opens her door to an older gentleman, who takes a seat at her table across from her. as the clock comes close to midnight, the woman leaps onto the dinner table and starts laughing.   "you fucking chumps!", the woman cries, "i tricked the lot of you! that man is the devil himself, and i made a deal with him years ago. but i added a little agreement to the contract and now you're going to hell in my place. sayonara, suckers! i'll be sure to visit you!"  with that, the clock strikes midnight, and the woman immediately falls over dead. the devil tells the guests he wants to meet them at the reverend's church, where he will fill them in on the details of his deal with the woman. he then calmly walks to her body, collects her soul, and disappears in a flash of fire.   the next day, all the guests meet at the reverend's church to and figure the most they can do is make peace with their families, friends, and god. at the exact time the devil said he would, he walks into the church and stands at the reverend's podium, ready to explain.   "you see, everyone, when we made that deal all those years ago, i knew she didn't want to go to hell. so i told her to bring me the five purest and kindest souls she could find, as five souls balance out against one sold soul. of course, with all the good you do for this city and its people, you five were the best candidates she could have gotten. well, i'd like to thank you folks for showing up. you enjoy the rest of your day, and your lives." the devil then starts to calmly walk to the church's door. as he is about to leave, the reverend speaks up.  "i-i-i don't understand. what do you mean 'enjoy the rest of our lives'? how could we, if we now know no matter what we do in life, we are condemned to perdition when we die?"  the devil slyly smirks.  "i only said that i wanted her to present to me the five purest souls she could find. i never said i was going to take them."	4

"all right."  a few days later, the first guy tells his friend, "hey, i have my first 'generic ethnic' joke!"  "awesome," says the friend. "let's hear it!"  "so there are two generically ethnic guys named lars and sven....."   edit: changed "earl" to "lars"	2

a woman is in a car crash and is in a coma in hospital days, then weeks, then months go by with no sign of life or improvement. they were at a loss and running out of ideas.  one day a nurse was in the room changing the lady's bedding and accidentally touched the woman's thigh. the nurse noticed that the woman's eyes flickered very slightly, so she ran to get a doctor.  the doctor came into the room and touched the woman's thigh and sure enough her eyes flickered a little. the doctor said to the nurse "i wonder if she's responding to sexual simulation" so he stroked her breast and the woman's eyes flickered again.  very excited, the nurse ran to the phone and called the lady's husband and told him to come to the hospital straight away. the doctor explained the situation and suggested to the man that maybe, just maybe, if he were to give her oral sex, she might come out of the coma.  so the doctor and nurse left the man alone in the room with his wife and waited outside. suddenly the alarms started going off and the woman was flat lining. the doctor and nurse burst into the room shouting "what happened, what happened?" to the husband. the husband looking confused said "i'm not sure, i think she must have choked"	1

"it is a miracle, i can see again."	8

an old fisherman suspected his wife of cheating, so he hired a private investigator... this is a long one, so bear with me.   the fisherman and his wife lived in saint john’s, newfoundland and he made his living by going out into the ocean to net cod under the watchful eye of his captain.    in those days, the best fishing was to be found far out on the banks very far from the shore, so the fisherman was often away from home for weeks at a time. since he was away so much, the marriage had suffered and he saw in the way his wife acted that she must be unfaithful. he would’ve suspected the captain as his wife’s lover, for he had always had eyes for his lady. however, this was not possible, as they were together on the modest fishing boat. the same went for the helmsman and the first mate. still, he remembered his wife’s distant demeanour and knew that she must be seeking comfort in the arms of another.    now, the fisherman’s father had been a mean old drunken fool, but also a very fine whaler in the dying days of that storied profession. before he died, he left his son with a valuable lesson: to conquer the swiftest and most clever of whales, you need not be swifter nor cleverer; only more persistent than he. these words echoed in the man’s mind the day that he called up a private investigator.      the retired detective was a mainlander, and had a high fee. the fisherman figured it was worth it though, and slipped the money to him over the counter of a run-down pub one day as they discussed the details of the case. the fisherman was only in port for a short while at a time though (‘no wonder he has marriage troubles,’ thought the detective) so he soon left his wife, the detective, and the home-wrecker behind  in saint john’s.  two weeks later, the fisherman returned and was disappointed to hear from the detective that there were no leads in the case as they sipped whiskey at the pub. nevertheless he paid the man again before heading out onto the sea once more.    you can probably guess that this continued for a while, with the detective finding nothing the second time around. but the old sea dog remembered his father’s wise words and paid the investigator again.  but then, weeks later on a chilly september morning, the fisherman spied the private investigator waving to him from the end of a pier as the cod-laden boat pulled in to port.    “come quick!” hollered the detective, “not only have i confirmed that your wife has taken a lover, her and the bastard are at your house right now!”    so the two men sped off towards the fisherman’s house, and sure enough, as they peeked through the living room window his wife and lover were there, doing things that we don’t mention in polite company.    “i’ll be damned,” said the fisherman. “i was right all along. i guess it was worth paying your fee all this time. what do you say we head down to the pub? i’d like to buy you a beer or two!”    “but what about the man who’s been sleeping with your wife?” asked the private investigator, shocked at the man’s nonchalance.   “oh, that rotten bastard?” replied the fisherman. “he can buy his own damn beer!”	1
a cake walks into a bar barman: gateau-t!	2
the local bar was so sure that its bartender was the strongest man around that they offered a standing $1000 bet the local bar was so sure that its bartender was the strongest man around that they offered a standing $1000 bet.    the bartender would squeeze a lemon until all the juice ran into a glass, and hand the lemon to a patron. anyone who could squeeze one more drop of juice out would win the money.     many people had tried over time (weight-lifters, longshoremen, etc.) but nobody could do it.    one day this scrawny little man came into the bar, wearing thick glasses and a polyester suit, and said in a tiny squeaky voice.  "i'd like to try the bet." after the laughter had died down, the bartender said ok, grabbed a lemon, and squeezed away.    then he handed the wrinkled remains of the rind to the little man.    but the crowd's laughter turned to total silence as the man clenched his fist around the lemon and six drops fell into the glass.     as the crowd cheered, the bartender paid the $1000, and asked the little man.      "what do you do for a living? are you a lumberjack, a weight-lifter, what?"      the man replied, "i work for the irs."	8

red skeleton’s recipe for the perfect marriage 1. two times a week we go to a nice restaurant, have a little beverage, good food and companionship.  she goes on tuesdays, i go on fridays. 2. we also sleep in separate beds.  hers is in california and mine is in texas. 3. i take my wife everywhere, but she keeps finding her way back. 4. i asked my wife where she wanted to go for our anniversary.  "somewhere i haven't been in a long time!" she said. so i suggested the kitchen. 5. we always hold hands. if i let go, she shops. 6. she has an electric blender, electric toaster and electric bread maker.  she said "there are too many gadgets, and no place to sit down!" so i bought her an electric chair. 7. my wife told me the car wasn't running well because there was water in the carburetor.  i asked where the car was. she told me, "in the lake." 8. she got a mud pack and looked great for two days.  then the mud fell off. 9. she ran after the garbage truck, yelling, "am i too late for the garbage?" the driver said, "no, jump in!". 10. remember: marriage is the number one cause of divorce. 11. i married miss right. i just didn't know her first name was 'always'. 12. i haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months.  i don't like to interrupt her. 13. the last fight was my fault though.  my wife asked, "what's on the tv?" i said, "dust!". can't you just hear him say all of these? i love it. these were the good old days when humor didn't have to start with a four letter word. it was just clean and simple fun. and he always ended his programs with the words,  "and may god bless" with a big smile on his face.	2

a man walked into an agent’s office in hollywood and said “i want to be a movie star.” tall, handsome and with experience on broadway, he had the right credentials. the agent asked, “what’s your name?”  the guy said, “my name is penis van lesbian.”  the agent said, “sir, i hate to tell you this, but in order to get into hollywood, you are going to have to change your name.”  “i will not change my name! the van lesbian name is centuries old, i will not disrespect my grandfather by changing my name. not ever.”  the agent said, “sir, i have worked in hollywood for years you will never go far with a name like penis van lesbian! i’m telling you, you will have to change your name or i will not be able to represent you.” “so be it! i guess we will not do business together” the guy said and he left the agent’s office.  five years later the agent opens an envelope sent to his office. inside the envelope is a letter and a check for $50,000. the agent is awe-struck, who would possibly send him $50,000? he reads the letter enclosed.  “dear sir, five years ago, i came into your office wanting to become an actor in hollywood, you told me i needed to change my name. determined to make it with my god-given birth name, i refused. you told me i would never make it in hollywood with a name like penis van lesbian. after i left your office, i thought about what you said and i decided you were right, i had to change my name. i had too much pride to return to your office, so i signed with another agent. i would never have made it without changing my name, so the enclosed cheque is a token of my appreciation.  thank you for your advice.  sincerely,  dick van dyke.	7

a man dies and goes to hell... he arrives in hell to find satan standing behind a podium, like a game show host, there are 3 doors behind him, marked 1,2 and 3, coloured red, white and blue.  the man walks up to satan, satan says “ choose a door, but beware, once in you cannot leave” the man asks “ well what’s behind the doors?” , satan replies “ that i cannot tell you, you must choose on faith”.  the man looks to the red door, places his hand on the knob and was about to open it when he heard a moan, he stops and puts his ear to the door and could hear what one could only assume was an incredibly big orgy, he steps back, unsure if it’s a trick or maybe the other doors lead to greater things,   he gets to the next door, the white door, puts his ear to it and faintly hears “ don’t make a wave...don’t make a wave...don’t make a wave”... , the man is perplexed, he looks to satan, and satan shrugs,  finally he gets to the blue door, puts his ear to it and can hear a raging party, music, fireworks and thousands of people cheering,   the man turns back to satan and says “ this is a trick! i’m not that stupid pal, i know doors 1 & 3 are a trap, i’m taking the white door!”   the man proudly strides towards doors 2and flings it open, it’s completely dark inside and he can now clearly hear people chant “don’t make a wave... don’t make a wave...” he takes one last look at satan , smiles, says “ don’t make a wave huh?” and does the biggest bomb he’s ever done into the darkness...  and as he falls he see’s the people who were chanting... standing neck deep in shit.	6

was reminded of my dad’s favorite joke when i saw a similar joke posted earlier today. he owns his own construction company and would tell this to everyone. all the body parts get together to decide who is the boss of the body.  first is the brain. “it’s obvious i’m the boss. i’m the smartest and without me the body wouldn’t even know what to do.”  the hands speak up and say, “without us the body wouldn’t be able to get food to the mouth. the body couldn’t drive, use tools, etc.”  the feet go next and say, “well without us the body wouldn’t get anywhere. it couldn’t walk, dance, play sports.”  each body part gets a turn giving the reasons why they are the most important and should be the boss.  last to go is the asshole. it claims it is the boss and every other body part just laughs and makes fun of the asshole. “what do you do? you have the least important job.” so the asshole closes as tight as it can and lets nothing get by it.  after a few hours the other body parts are starting to feel weird but don’t concede that the asshole is the boss. close to a week passes and the feet are feeling weak, the hands can’t grab things as well, and the brain can’t think clearly. still, the asshole stays shut tight.  a few more days pass and all the other body parts can barely function at all. the body keeps falling because the feet can’t keep it up. it’s hungry because the hands can’t pick up food and the brain can’t even think straight.  finally all the body parts concede that the asshole is the most important body part. so the asshole opens up and everything soon returns to normal for the other body parts.   so to be the boss you don’t have to be smart, strong, or extremely useful. you just need to be an asshole.	2

the mystery of the murder of crows  (this is my favorite joke that i read on here years ago, i haven't seen it in a while... figure it's time for a repost... forgive me if it's been more recent then i believe)  researchers for the massachusetts turnpike authority (mta) found over 200 dead crows near greater boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from avian flu. a bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely not avian flu. the cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.  however, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. by analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.  mta then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.  the ornithological behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.  the scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say "cah", none could say "truck."	3

"is that true?"  "if you want, you can have these two apple cores for $4."  so they buy them and eat them. an hour later one of them says:  "dude, we're stupid. we bought two apple cores for 4 bucks when we'd be able to buy 3 pounds of apples!"  the other replies: "oh my god, it works!"	6

"is your daddy home?" he asked.  "yes," whispered the little voice.  "may i talk with him?"  the child whispered, "no."  surprised and wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, "is your mommy there?"  "yes."  "may i talk with her?"  again the small voice whispered, "no."  hoping there was someone with whom he could leave a message, the boss asked, "is anyone else there?"  "yes," whispered the child, "a policeman."  wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked, "may i speak with the policeman?"  "no, he's busy," whispered the child.  "busy doing what?"  "talking to mommy and daddy and the neighbours," came the whispered answer.  growing more worried as he heard a loud noise through the earpiece on the phone, the boss asked, "what is that noise?"  "a helicopter," answered the whispering voice.  "what is going on there?" demanded the boss, now truly apprehensive.  again, whispering, the child answered, "the search team just landed a helicopter."  alarmed, confused, and a little frustrated, the boss asked, "what are they searching for?"  still whispering, the young voice replied with a muffled giggle..."me!"	7

"i feel nothing" says the husband. "crank it up to 75%" the scientist is hesitant, but turns the machine up to 75%.   "i still feel nothing" the husband says, "crank it up to 100%" the scientist slowly turns the machine to 100%, and the wife begins to feel nothing.   "huh" says the husband. "turn it up to 200%, i'm curious"  the scientist, seeing that the man is completely fine turns the machine up to 200% and the man still feels nothing.  the baby is born and after some time spent in the hospital, the couple go home. as they pull up to their driveway they find the mailman dead on the front porch.

sam was a man with big dreams who lived in a small countryside village one day, sam decided to follow his dreams and went to the big city. "now you gotta find a job, sam" he said to himself, and went to search for one.  after being rejected from several job interviews, sam returns defeated to his home, there, he decides not to give up. with some money from his parents he travels back to the big city and opens his own business, a small pub he named "sam's pub".  soon the pub gets popular, and people starts calling it "sub" for short. "sub" becomes one of the city's main attractions, and sam lives the good life. he buys himself a big house with a big yard and an expensive car. one day sam decides to expend his business, and opens more and more branches. by the advice of his business consultor, he also adds a yard for every branch, to attract costumers.  two months after, sam goes to his largest "sam's pub" branch to check it, and finds out the manager was doing a horrible job, even though he was supposed to be a professional, and was paid a very high salary. sam realized finding a good manager is hard these days, so he decided to be the manager himself. he worked hard, but managed to handle the pub well.  business was booming. sam became very rich. one day he decided to change "sam's pub" to "sub", since people anyway call it "sub". sam soon found out it was a mistake. subway sued his network for copyright, and he went to the sentence that had the chance to destroy his life.  after explaining the situation, the court and the judge let him go free of charge. he wasn't free from the situation entirely though. there was a small group of people that believed he bribed the judge, and wanted to bring down his business.  one day, the pub that sam was its manager needed maintenance, and sam stayed to sleep there. during the night, someone untucked all the fences and the mailbox in the yard, and as a final cruel joke they stole sam's car. sam was devastated. he couldn's figure out how they stole the car, and had to repost all the fences and the mailbox, leaving ugly holes in the ground.  the same day, his mother decided to visit her successful son. as she went to see her son, she noticed he was posting a mailbox and looked very frustrated.  "what happened, sam dear?" asked his mother.  "ma, it's so annoying" replied sam  "this sub is full of reposts, and the thief gets car,ma!"	1
irish cow joke there is an old dirt farm family who have nothing of value in this world but their milk cow. now this was z good milk cow, which gave good high quality milk which they were able to sell and get along, so the family was actually very content. well one day the father gets up early to milk the cow, as was his routine and found the cow dead in the field. well, the father gets distraught as he now knows the family is ruined so in his grief, he hangs himself in the barn. soon after, the mother gets up and goes out to bring her husband some breakfast in the field, finds the the cow dead, then goes into the barn and sees her husband hanged. now she is completely beside herself, so she goes down to the creek and drowns.   well a little while later, the eldest son comes out, sees the cow dead in the field, dad dead in the barn,  mom dead in the creek, and a fae sitting on a rock. quite taken 'aback, at the events he isn't that surprised when the fae speaks.  "you look like you're having a bad day." she says.  "i should say." he responds  "well, i may be able to help. if you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, i'll restore all you've lost." she says.  now a fae bargain in not to be taken likely but he considers it being not much more than twenty and quite verial, he decides to take her up on it. true to her word they go at it, but he just isn't able to get there, so she kills him for the disappointment.   soon after the second son comes down after seeing the cow, the dad in the barn, mother and brother in the creek, and the fae on the rocks.  "you look like you're having a bad day." she says.  "i am." he says.  again she tell of her ability to help saying "if you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, i'll restore all you've lost."   well he doesn't even think twice thinking that he is just 18 and quite ready. so they go at it but just as he starts the last time, he get a cramp and collapses in exhaustion. dissatisfied she kills him dead for waiting her time.  finally the 16 year old son comes on down. the cow dead in the field. dad dead in the barn, mom and two brothers dead in the creek and the fae combing her hair on the rocks.   once again she greets him with "you look like you're having a bad day."   "i am." he says sadly  again she tell of her ability to help saying "if you can make love to me ten times in a row without stopping, i'll restore all you've lost."   unexpectedly, he asks, "fine, but what if i make love to you fifteen times?"  "fifteen times!" the fae snorts, "well, if you can do that, i'll restore all that you've lost and give you a mansion right where your hovel stands."  "aye grand, but let me ask you, what if i do it twenty times?" he asked after a thought.  "twenty times?" the fae snickered. "faith, i do all that from before and i'll give you a big crock of gold that never empties."   the young man thinks for another second then straightens up and says. "alright, we can start in a moment, but let me ask you this one last thing. if i make love to you twenty times, whats to stop you from dying before we finish? i mean the cow did."	2

i've known paul for years he's always been such a nice guy. in middle school, our teachers would always ask if he finished his homework. paul would hold up his homework and say yes. during lunch, kids would always ask if they could sit with him, and paul would say yes. a kid would ask if he's trade his pudding cup for an apple and he'd say yes. i was amazed by how nice and generous he was, not to mention positive.  in high school, paul was asked to join the basketball team. her said yes and lead the school all the way to the championships. some other students asked if he'd tutor them, and he said yes. then the most popular girl in school asked him to prom. we were all surprised that he didn't ask her first. but he said yes. then before graduation, he as asked to be valedictorian. and as you may have guessed, he said yes.  he went to college, and got a great job as soon as he got his degree. he worked his way up. every time he was offered a promotion, he said yes. paul became a wealthy man. and charitable. when the hospital asked for a donation, he said yes. when the schools asked for a donation, he said yes. when a complete stranger asked him to pay for his surgery, paul said yes.  then paul's girlfriend proposed, and he said yes. being his oldest and closest friend, i was asked to be his best friend. i said "i'll to it, paul. but first, i have to ask. why do you always say yes to everything?"  paul simply shrugged and said "i don't no."	6

several years ago, great britain funded a study to determine why the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft. the study took two years and cost over 1.2 million pounds. it concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.   after the results were published, france decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. they were convinced that the results of the british study were incorrect. after three years of research at a cost of in excess of 2 million euros, the french researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex.   when the results of the french study were released, australia decided to conduct their own study. the aussies didn't really trust british or french studies. so, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around 75 dollars (three cases of beer), the aussie study was complete. they concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead.	8

jack decided to go skiing with his best buddy, bob. so they loaded up jack’s minivan and headed north. after driving for a few hours, they got caught in a terrible blizzard. so they pulled into a nearby farm and asked the attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.  "i realize it's terrible weather out there and i have this huge house all to myself, but i'm recently widowed," she explained. "i'm afraid the neighbors will talk if i let you stay in my house." "don't worry," jack said. "we'll be happy to sleep in the barn. and if the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light." the lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled in for the night.     come morning, the weather had cleared and they got on their way. they enjoyed a great weekend of skiing. but about nine months later, jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney. it took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski weekend. he dropped in on his friend bob and asked, "bob, do you remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski holiday up north about 9 months ago?" "yes, i do." said bob "did you, er, happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house and pay her a visit?" "well, um, yes..." bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out, "i have to admit that i did." "and did you happen to give her my name instead of telling her your name?" bob's face turned beet red and he said, "yeah, look, i'm sorry, buddy. i'm afraid i did. why do you ask?"     "she just died and left me everything."	8

"you still have fifteen more minutes."  the boy turned to the girl. "you wanna do it again?"  "okay, but this time, *you* hold down the pigeon, and *i* poop on its head!"	3

"maam, i'm sorry to bring this up to you, but we have an issue with your husband. you see, he has a massive erection and coffin won't fully close"  sure enough, she looks over at the coffin and while the top half was open for viewing, the bottom half was propped open by a few inches.  the director continues "we hoped the pressure from the lid would have helped it go down, but it's pretty solid. our only final option is to cut it off and tuck it in beside him. can we have your permission to do so?"  mindy thought for a second, she appeared a little baffled, but finally replied "of course, if it needs to be cut off, then go ahead and do so. but dont just leave it beside him, shove it up his ass" now the director had a shocked look so mindy continued "trust me, it will be fine"  so while some of the family said a few final words, the director took bob away for the procedure and returned shortly after with one side open and the other side fully closed.  mindy approached bob to say her final goodbye. as she got close she noticed some tears were running down his face. she pulled out a tissue, wiped his tears away, leaned in and whispered in his ear "see, i told you it hurts"	4

the woman says: "doctor, i don't know what to do. every day my husband seems to lose his temper for no reason. it scares me."    the doctor says: "i have a cure for that. when it seems that your husband is getting angry, just take a glass of water and start swishing it in your mouth. just   swish and swish but don't swallow it until he either leaves the room or calms down."  two weeks later the woman comes back to the doctor looking fresh and reborn.  the woman says: "doctor that was a brilliant idea! every time my husband started losing it, i swished with water. i swished and swished, and he calmed right down! how   does a glass of water do that?"  the doctor says: "the water itself does nothing. it's keeping your mouth shut that does the trick..."	6

after trying many fruits and vegetables in my kids lunch, their favourite by far was sliced cucumber. i don’t know if it was our source, or our fridge, but they only really stayed fresh for a few days. this meant that at least twice a week i was stopping at the corner grocery store to just grab a couple cucumbers.  after a couple months it became obvious that i kept buying them from the same clerk. the way he interacted with me also changed, giving me little smile’s and sometimes a wink.  all of a sudden it hit me, and i felt embarrassed by what he was probably thinking. the next time i went in i also grabbed a jar of vaseline; hopefully i fixed this before he spread any rumours about me being a vegan.	8

market  a  young guy from west virginia moves to florida and goes to a big  "everything under one roof" department store looking for a job.    the manager says, "do you have any sales experience?" the kid says "yeah. i was a vacuum salesman back in west virginia ."    well, the boss was unsure, but he liked the kid and figured he'd give him a shot, so he gave him the job.    "you start tomorrow. i'll come down after we close and see how you did."   his first day on the job was rough, but he got through it. after the  store was locked up, the boss came down to the sales floor.    "how  many customers bought something from you today?" the kid frowns and  looks at the floor and mutters, "one". the boss says "just one?!!? our  sales people average sales to 20 to 30 customers a day.    that will  have to change, and soon, if you'd like to continue your employment  here. we have very strict standards for our sales force here in florida. one sale a day might have been acceptable in west virginia , but you're  not in the mines anymore, son."   the kid took his beating, but  continued to look at his shoes, so the boss felt kinda bad for chewing  him out on his first day. he asked (semi-sarcastically), "so, how much  was your one sale for?"    the kid looks up at his boss and says "$101,237.65".    the boss, astonished, says $101,237.65?!? what the heck did you sell?"    the kid says, "well, first, i sold him some new fish hooks. then i sold him a new fishing rod to go with his new hooks. then i asked him where  he was going fishing and he said down the coast, so i told him he was going to need a boat, so we went down to the boat department and i sold him a twin engine chris craft. then he said he didn't think his honda civic would pull it, so i took him down to the automotive department and sold him that 4x4 expedition."   the boss said "a guy came in  here to buy a fish hook and you sold him a boat and a truck!?" the kid  said "no, the guy came in here to buy tampons for his wife, and i said,  'dude, your weekend is fucked, perhaps you should go fishing.	5

so there was this man in bulgaria who drove trains for a living. he loved his job. driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. he loved to make the train go as fast as possible. unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. he made it out, but a single person died. well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. he was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. when the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. after eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. the man was perfectly fine.    well, at the time, there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. the trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. for his final meal, the man requested two bananas. after eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.    well, this of course meant that he was free to go. and once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. to what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. on the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.    "you know what? no," said the executioner. "i've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. i'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now." well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. the switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. the executioner was speechless.   the man looked at the executioner and said, "oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. i'm just a bad conductor."	6

what could possibly be making such a seductive sound? a man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. he goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “my car broke down. do you think i could stay the night?”  the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. as the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. a sound unlike anything he’s ever heard before. the sirens that nearly seduced odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. he doesn’t sleep that night. he tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.  the next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “we can’t tell you. you’re not a monk.” distraught, the man is forced to leave.  years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.  the monks reply, “we can’t tell you. you’re not a monk.”  the man says, “if the only way i can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.”  the monks reply, “you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. when you find these answers, you will have become a monk.” the man sets about his task.  after years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. a monk answers. he is taken before a gathering of all the monks.  “in my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, i traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: by design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. only god knows what you ask. all a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.”  the monks reply, “congratulations. you have become a monk. we shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.”  the monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “the sound is beyond that door.”  the monks give him the key, and he opens the door. behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. the man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. and so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.  finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. the sound has become very clear and definite. the monks say, “this is the last key to the last door.”  the man is apprehensive to no end. his life’s wish is behind that door!  with trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound……  but, of course, i can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk…  (h/t morris devereaux)	6

"how's it going so far?" asks the driver.  "oh," says the policeman, "we're up to about a thousand gallons, but a load of drivers are still siphoning."	3

my favorite joke! it was a huge hit with my friends in germany, so i'm very exited to see what you think. i translated everything from german to english, so feel free to correct any mistake in the comments. being very annoyed by his female boss and co-workers, a guy tells his friend he dreams of a job where women are not allowed.  &#x200b;  his friend thinks about it then says:  “i think you have two options, either you work as train driver or you work as a pilot, if you decide to work as train driver everything would be fine, but if you become a pilot then there are only two options:  either your plane crashes or it doesn't crash, if it doesn't crash everything would be fine, but if the plane crashes then there are only two options:  either you die or you survive, if you survive everything would be fine, but if you die then there are only two options:  either you get cremated or you get buried, if you get cremated everything would be fine, but if you get buried then there are only two options:  either you grow into a flower or you grow into a tree, if you grow into flower everything would be fine, but if you grow into a tree then there are only two options:  either they cut you down or they don’t cut you down, if they don’t cut you down everything would be fine, but if they cut you down then there are only two options:   either they make you into normal paper or they make you into toilet paper, if they make you into normal paper everything would be fine, but if they make you into toilet paper then there are only two options:  either you are put in the men’s restroom or you are put in the women’s restroom, if you're put in the men’s restroom then everything would be fine, but if you’re put in the women’s restroom then this was just a huge fucking waste of time.”	5

boudreaux the baptist boudreaux was a cajun highlander from rapides parish in central louisiana who was born and raised a baptist . each friday night after work, he would fire up his outdoor grill and cook a venison steak.  now, as a point of interest, all of boudreaux's neighbors were catholic and as such were forbidden to eat meat on fridays.  the delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a problem for the catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest. the priest came to visit boudreaux and suggested that boudreaux convert to catholicism. boudreaux agreed. after several classes and much study, boudreaux attended mass to be confirmed. as the priest sprinkled holy water over boudreaux he said, "you were born a baptist and raised a baptist, but now you are a catholic."  boudreaux's neighbors were greatly relieved until the next friday night arrived and the wonderful aroma of grilled venison again filled the air. the priest was called by some of his angry parishioners and told of boudreaux'’s actions . the priest assured the callers that he would be there immediately. when he got there he rushed into boudreaux's yard clutching a rosary. he was prepared to scold boudreaux for what he was doing but what he saw and heard made him stop in amazement. there at the grill stood boudreaux. he was clutching a small bottle of water, which he carefully sprinkled over the sizzling meat as he chanted: "you wuz born a deer, and you wuz raised a deer, but now you are a catfish."	5

a politician dies… and ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. saint peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.      “so, you’re a politician…” “well, yes, is that a problem?” “oh no, no problem. but we’ve recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in hell. after that however, you’re free to choose where you want to spend eternity!”      “wait, i have to spend a day in hell??” says the politician. “them’s the rules” says st peter, clicks his fingers, and woomph, the guy dissapears… and awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he’s in hell. cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds… nothing. just the smell of, is that fabric softener? and cut grass, this can’t be right?      “open your eyes!” says a voice. “c'mon, wakey wakey, we’ve only got 24 hours!”. nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he’s in a hotel room. a nice one too. wait, this is a penthouse suite… and there’s a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. “who are you??” the politician asks. “well, i’m satan!” says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. “welcome to hell!” “wait, this is hell? but… where’s all the pain and suffering?” he asks. satan throws him a wink. “oh, we’ve been a bit mis-represented over the years, it’s a long story. anyway, this is your room! the minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there’s extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. but enough of this! it’s a beautiful day, and if you’d care to look outside…” slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. “it’s one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there’s another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!” says satan, answering his unasked question. so they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. and as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he’s admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he’s admired but died long before his career started. and out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. he spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with marylin monroe). as everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear… and they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. after 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep… and is woken up by st peter. “so, that was hell. wasn’t what you were expecting, i bet?” “no sir!” says the man. “so then” says st peter “you can make your choice. it’s hell, which you saw, or heaven, which has choral singing, talking to god, white robes, and so on”. “well… i know this sounds strange, but on balance, i think i’d prefer hell” says the politician. “not a problem, we totally understand! enjoy!” says st peter, and clicks his fingers again.      the man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. as he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. a sudden bolt of lightning reveals satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. “what’s this??” he cries. “where’s the hotel?? where’s my wife??? where’s the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???”      “ah”, says satan. “you see, yesterday, we were campaigning. but today, you voted…”	7

so a poor man walks into a pet store hoping to buy a parrot. he looks at a whole bunch of parrots, but all of them are out of his price range. he asks one of the employees if they have a cheaper parrot.   “actually, we have one parrot that nobody has wanted to buy. his name is chet and he very lovable, but he’s only got one leg.”  the man asks to see this parrot. the employee goes to the back and brings out a very old, one-legged parrot.   the man asks if the parrot can do any tricks.   “well, if you hold a match right under the stump of his leg, he will sing a christmas song for you.”  the man is intrigued and holds a match under the parrots leg. the bird begins to sing.   “jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way”  the man laughs and asks if he can do anything else.   the employee says,   “well, you could try to put the match under the other leg and see what happens.”  so the man puts the match under the parrot’s leg. to their astonishment, the bird begins to sing again.   “here comes santa claus, here comes santa claus right down santa claus lane!”  the man is mystified by the parrot and how good it sounds. but he decides to try one more thing. so he asks,  “what would happen if you put the match between the parrot’s leg?”  the employee laughs.   “i don’t know what would happen,” he says. “you could try it.”  so the man puts the match between the parrot’s leg. again, the bird begins to sing.   “chet’s nuts roasting on an open fire...”	4

"can i have my duck back?" he asked the hooker. "your so good," said the hooker. "only if we go at it once more." so they did.   the prostitute gave ted his duck back and said, "i have a sister whose husband hasn't been able to get it up in years. i'll call her and tell her about you." so she called her sister and sent ted to her sister's house.   ted arrived at the hooker's sister's house with his duck. the sister had been so excited that she would have sex for the first time in years that she had let it slip out. her husband answered the door and said, "if you don't ball my wife, i will give you my dollar." ted accepted.   while ted was accepting the money, the duck flew away from him. a huge truck came roaring down the street and killed the duck. the truck driver gave ted a dollar for his duck.   when george and ted arrived home, there father asked george, "how much did you make?" "twenty dollars from the slaughterhouse," said george. "and you?" he asked ted.   and ted responded, "i got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck, a buck to duck a fuck, and a buck for a duck fucked up by a truck."﻿	3

a man goes into the woods hunting he spots a deer in a clearing and lines up his shot, just as he's about to pull the trigger he feels a tap on his shoulder. he turns to see a black bear looming over him, it rumbles "you've two choices, either i eat you, or i have sex with you". the man opts for the latter and hobbles back in to town plotting his revenge.  the following day he heads back in to the woods to track the black bear, again as he lines up his shot he feels a tap on his shoulder, this time a huge grizzly stands over him and rumbles "you've two choices, either i eat you, or have sex with you" humiliated and sore the hunter crawls back to town plotting revenge.  the next day, armed with an elephant rifle he tracks down the grizzly bear, he takes a deep breath, puts his eye to the scope. again he feels a tap on the shoulder. standing over him is a gigantic polar bear who says "you don't come here for the hunting do you?"	6

three nuns passed away and went up to heaven. they were pleasantly surprised when saint peter informed them that in exchange for their many years of servitude and chastity, god himself was going to bestow upon them each one wish... the first nun said with a blush, "this is slightly embarrassing, but i have to admit, while i did love serving the lord, the vow of chastity was really tough on me. may i return to earth for a weekend of unbridled lust, with the face and body of angelina jolie?"  saint peter said, "your wish is granted!"  poof  she disappeared and returned to earth to fulfill her fantasy.  the second nun agreed and said, "i'd like the same, but may i return with the face and body of jessica alba?"  saint peter said again, "your wish is granted!"  poof  away she went!  the third nun, an italian girl, nodded her head in agreement, "i too would like the same, but may i return with the face and body of alice gan pipalini?"  with a confused look, saint peter replied, "i'm sorry sister, but i do not know of her? is she a famous starlet?"  the sister squealed with excitement,"oh my, yes, yes she is! she's the most famous one of them all! why, look at this article i've been saving for years!"  and with that, she reached into her pocket and pulled out an old, yellow, folded up newspaper article, which she handed to him with shaking hands.  saint peter slowly unfolded the paper and read the headline aloud,"alaskan pipeline laid by 500 men in one week."	4

"i'm not sure, dad, i'll have to think about it."  late that night, the boy's sleep was disturbed by the crying of his baby brother. he got up and fond that the baby had soiled its diaper. he went to his parents' room and found his mother fast asleep, and then discovered that is father was boinking the maid so vigorously that they didn't hear his knocks on the door. he returned to his bed and went to sleep.   next morning he reported to his father. "dad i now think i understand what politics is."  "good my boy. explain it to me in your own words."  "well capitalism is screwing the working class and the government is sound asleep, the people are being completely ignored and the future is full of shit."	6

a miner moves out west to california... a miner moves out west to california. having spent a few years in colorado, he has a pretty good idea of the sort of lifestyle miner's live; up from dawn 'til dusk in the mines, and then up from dusk 'til dawn drinking and playing card games.  so, to his surprise, when he moves to bluster's bluff, the town is dead silent. no sounds of metal against rock, no barroom songs, no children playing in the streets - nothing. so, curiously, he peeks into the local saloon.  sure enough, the saloon is packed to the gills with tough looking miners just like himself. however, all of them are sitting quietly, looking at the floor, not saying a word.  the miner sits down next to a townsfolk and says, "pardon me sir, but is there any work around here for a miner to do?"  the townsperson looks at him like he's crazy. "well sure, pal," he says, "but you can't be goin' into the mines today!"  "why not?"  "because farmer john just harvested his wheat! we have to wait for him to grind it into flour!" he responds as if it's obvious.  not wanting to look like too much of an outsider, the miner simply nods his head, grabs something to drink, and decides to go home early.  the following day, he returns to the saloon. again, it's packed, and again, everyone is sitting in silence.  cautiously, he approaches the person he talked to the other day and asks, "what about today? is today alright for mining?"  he shakes his head. "no, son. the wells fargo wagon doesn't come into town until tomorrow, and we need a bag of sugar."  again, the miner pretends he understands before going home to read a book.  he begins to get restless. on the third day, he returns to the saloon, and to his surprise finds it empty except for the barkeep. his hopes begin to rise and he starts to head towards the mines - that is, of course, until he spots all the miners at farmer john's farm.  he approached the crowd and sees them all crowded around the chicken coop. he grabs one of them by the shoulders and says, "can we *please* get to mining today? i'm sick and tired of sitting around!"  "yeah, yeah, we will! we just have to wait until ol' betty-lou here lays an egg!"  the miner throws up his hands and storms home.  however, on the fourth day, he wakes up to cheering and gunfire and song. he runs outside and sees the miners dancing in the streets, causing a ruckus, and getting their pickaxes and shovels ready.  "what the hell's going on?" demands the miner.  "ol' betty-lou laid her some eggs, and now missus john is baking up a storm! we can finally mine again!"  "what on god's green earth are you talking about?" he yells. "this whole time we've been waiting for some lady to get to work in her kitchen? why the hell does that matter?"  "didn't you know, son?" he replies, excitedly. "cake day's the best day to get gold!"	8

recently a routine police patrol was parked outside a bar in the outback. after last call, the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so apparently intoxicated that he could barely walk.  the man stumbled around the parking lot for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing.  after what seemed an eternity, in which he tried his keys on five different vehicles, the man managed to find his car and fall into it.  he sat there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off.  finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off; it was a fine, dry summer night, flicked the blinkers on and off a couple of times, honked the horn and then switched on the lights.  he moved the vehicle forward a few inches, reversed a little, and then remained still for a few more minutes as some more of the other patrons' vehicles left.  at last, when his was the only car left in the parking lot, he pulled out and drove slowly down the road.  the police officer, having waited patiently all this time, now started up his patrol car, put on the flashing lights, and promptly pulled the man over and administered a breathalyser test.  to his amazement, the breathalyzer indicated no evidence that the man had consumed any alcohol at all!  dumbfounded, the officer said, "i'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station. this breathalyser equipment must be broken." "i doubt it," said the truly proud redneck. "tonight i'm the designated decoy.	4

there was a man who had worked all his life, had saved all of his money, and was a real 'miser' when it came to his money.  just before he died, he said to his wife...'when i die, i want you to take all my money and put it in the casket with me. i want to take my money to the afterlife with me.'   and so he got his wife to promise him, with all of her heart, that when he died, she would put all of the money into the casket with him.  well, he died. he was stretched out in the casket, his wife was sitting there - dressed in black, and her friend was sitting next to her. when they finished the ceremony, and just before the undertakers got ready to close the casket, the wife said, 'wait just a moment!' she had a small metal box with her; she came over with the box and put it in the casket. then the undertakers locked the casket down and they rolled it away. so her friend said,  'girl, i know you were not fool enough to put all that money in there with your husband.'  the loyal wife replied, 'listen, i'm a christian; i cannot go back on my word. i promised him that i was go ing to put that money into the casket with him.'  you mean to tell me you put that money in the casket with him!?!?!?' 'i sure did,' said the wife. 'i got it all together, put it into my account, and wrote him a check.... if he can cash it, then he can spend it.'	7

a lady about 8 months pregnant... ...got on a bus she noticed the man opposite her was smiling at her. she immediately moved to another seat. this time the smile turned into a grin, so she moved again.  the man seemed more amused. when on the fourth move, the man burst out laughing, she complained to the driver and he had the man arrested.  the case came up in court. the judge asked the man (about 20 years old) what he had to say for himself.  the young man replied:  "well your honour, it was like this: when the lady got on the bus, i couldn’t help but notice her condition. she sat down under a sign that said, 'the double mint twins are coming' and i grinned.  then she moved and sat under a sign that said, 'logan’s liniment will reduce the swelling', and i had to smile. then she placed herself under a deodorant sign that said, 'william’s big stick did the trick', and i could hardly contain myself.  but, your honour, when she moved the fourth time and sat under a sign that said, "goodyear rubber could have prevented this accident", i just lost it."	6

'we must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances.' inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair... we need you to kill her' the man said, 'you can't be serious. i could never shoot my wife.' the agent said, 'then you're not the right man for this job. take your wife and go home.' the second man was given the same instructions. he took the gun and went into the room. all was quiet for about 5 minutes. the man came out with tears in his eyes, 'i tried, but i can't kill my wife.' the agent said, 'you don't have what it takes. take your wife home.' finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. he took the gun and went into the room. shots were heard, one after another. they heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. after a few minutes, all was quiet. the door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow.

life on the first day, god created the dog and said:  'sit all day by the door of your house and bark at anyone who comes in or walks past. for this, i will give you a life span of twenty years.'  the dog said: 'that's a long time to be barking. how about only ten years and i'll give you back the other ten?'  so god agreed.  on the second day, god created the monkey and said:  'entertain people, do tricks, and make them laugh. for this, i'll give you a twenty-year life span.'  the monkey said: 'monkey tricks for twenty years? that's a pretty long time to perform. how about i give you back ten like the dog did?'  and god agreed.  on the third day, god created the cow and said:  'you must go into the field with the farmer all day long and suffer under the sun, have calves and give milk to support the farmer's family. for this, i will give you a life span of sixty years.'  the cow said: 'that's kind of a tough life you want me to live for sixty years. how about twenty and i'll give back the other forty?'  and god agreed again.  on the fourth day, god created man and said:  'eat, sleep, play, marry and enjoy your life. for this, i'll give you twenty years.'  but man said: 'only twenty years? could you possibly give me my twenty, the forty the cow gave back, the ten the monkey gave back, and the ten the dog gave back; that makes eighty, okay?'  'okay,' said god, 'you asked for it.'  so that is why for our first twenty years we eat, sleep, play and enjoy ourselves. for the next forty years we slave in the sun to support our family. for the next ten years we do monkey tricks to entertain the grandchildren. and for the last ten years we sit on the front porch and bark at everyone.  &#x200b;  life has now been explained to you.	7

the jazz pianist an michelin star restaurant is looking for a pianist to entertain customers while they dine. the owner has been auditioning for weeks, but has had no luck finding someone suitable. one day, a guy called john comes in and says "hi there, i'm here about the pianist position."   the manager replies "that's fantastic, do you mind sitting at the piano and showing me what you can do?"   so john sits at the piano and starts to play. out comes one of the most subtle and beautiful pieces of music the manager has heard in his life. stunned at the end of the performance he says "that's absolutely wonderful, i love jazz, but i've never heard that piece before"   john replies "oh it's a piece that i wrote myself, i call it 'your daughter's tits were hanging out, so i slapped them with my cock'."   the manager is visibly taken aback, turning bright red, but still enthused by the music he stammers "oh, err right... urr, could you play another?"   the pianist resumes playing, and yet again plays an absolutely magical piece of music.   the manager says "incredible! but... what do you call this one...?"   enthusiastically john replies "oh, i call that one 'i'm going to stick my tongue up your arse and tickle your colon'."   shocked and struggling to find words, the manager says to him "ok, look, you're hired. you're clearly gifted and everything i've been looking for... but please, with respect, promise me, you won't let the clients know the names of your songs, the titles won't go down well  in an establishment like this."   so john agrees and starts work that night.   a few weeks later, the buzz about the restaurant's new pianist is incredible. the restaurant is packed every night and its almost impossible to get a reservation.   one evening, the pianist reaches the mid-point of his set, telling the diners that it is time for him to take a short comfort break, but he will return shortly.   as john walks back towards his piano through the packed restaurant, the manager, in a fluster, swiftly pulls him aside and exclaims "john! do you know.. your dick is dangling out of your trousers, practically the whole fucking room can see it?!"   "know it?!" john replies... "i fucking wrote it!"	2

a man with a 25 inch penis could not get any girl to sleep with him because his penis was too large... so he decided to go to the most famous doctor in the world to get some help.   the man asked “doctor, is there anything you can give me to make my penis smaller?” the doctor said “no, but i think a surgeon might be able to help you with your problem.”   so the man decided to go to the most famous surgeon in the world to get some help.  the man asked “surgeon, is there any surgery you can do to make my penis smaller?” the surgeon said “no, but i think a shaman might be able to help you with your problem.”  so the man decided to go to the most famous shaman in the world to get some help.   the man asked “shaman, is there any spell you can cast to make my penis smaller?” the shaman said “i can help you with your problem. all you have to do is ask the most beautiful woman in the world to sleep with you.   the man was discouraged after getting so close to his goal, but he decided he had nothing to lose so he went out to find that woman.   the man asked the woman “will you sleep with me?” the woman said “ew, no.” the man was about to give up when he realized that his penis shrunk by 5 inches.   curious, he asked the woman again. “will you sleep with me?” the woman said “didn’t you just hear me? i said no.” the man’s penis shrunk again by 5 inches. he realized that if he could get the woman to say no one more time, he’d have a 10 inch penis, which was the perfect size.   excited, he asked the woman one final time. “will you sleep with me?” the woman, enraged, said “are you deaf? how many times to i have to tell you so that you understand me? no, no, no!”	8

(oc) a buddy and i flew up to alaska to do some ice fishing. neither of us had ever been and we were both pretty excited, but when we got there my friend was just too freaked out about falling through the ice and freezing to death to go.  well, i was still super stoked so i ended up calling a local tourist company and i hired a couple of locals to take me out to show me how and where to fish.  turned out my guides were smoking hot twins.  best day ever.  we ended up hitting it off during our time on the ice and...well..one thing led to another.  that night i met up with my friend at the bar and i ended up telling him about this crazy ice fishing adventure with the hot twins.  he begged me to go into detail about what went down.  i told him i didn't want to get too graphic in public but in baseball terms: i stepped up to bat and put two points up on the board.  well this old guy sitting on the other end of the bar heard this and flipped the hell out.  we ended up nearly getting into a fight and the bartenders had to throw him out.  i asked the bartender what the deal with the crazy grandpa was.  apparently those twins were his daughters, and he was not a fan of my double on tundra...	7

the blind sales clerk a woman goes into cabela’s to buy a rod and reel for her grandson’s birthday. she doesn’t know which one to get, so she just grabs one and goes over to the counter.  the clerk was standing behind the counter wearing dark glasses. she says to him, “excuse me, sir. can you tell me anything about this rod and reel?” he says, “ma’am, i’m completely blind; but if you’ll drop it on the counter, i can tell you everything from the sound it makes.”  she doesn’t believe him but drops it on the counter anyway. he says, “that’s a 6-foot shakespeare graphite rod with a zebco 404 reel and 10-pound test line. it’s a good all-around combination, and it’s on sale this week for only $20.”  she says, “it’s amazing that you can tell all that just by the sound of it dropping on the counter. i’ll take it!”  as she opens her purse, her credit card drops on the floor. “oh, that sounds like a mastercard,” he says.  she bends down to pick it up and accidentally farts. at first she is really embarrassed, but then realizes there is no way the blind clerk could tell it was her who tooted. being blind, he wouldn’t know that she was the only person around?  the man rings up the sale and says, “that’ll be $34.50 please.”  the woman is totally confused by this and asks, “didn’t you tell me the rod and reel were on sale for $20? how did you get $34.50?”  he replies, “yes, ma’am. the rod and reel is $20, but the duck call is $11, and the catfish bait is $3.50.”  she paid it and left without saying a word.	7

blonde helping a trucker a blonde lady motorist was about two hours from san diego when she was flagged down by a man whose truck had broken down……  the man walked up to the car and asked, "are you going to san diego?"    "sure," answered the blonde, "do you need a lift?"   "not for me. i'll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck. my problem is i've got two chimpanzees in the back that have to be taken to the san diego zoo. they're a bit stressed already so i don't want to keep them on the road all day. could you possibly take them to the zoo for me? i'll give you $100 for your trouble."  "i'd be happy to," said the blonde.   so, the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde's car and carefully strapped into their seat belts, and off they went.   five hours later, the truck driver was driving through the heart of san diego when suddenly he was horrified!  there was the blonde walking down the street, holding hands with the two chimps, much to the amusement of a big crowd.   with a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde.   "what are you doing here?" he demanded, "i gave you $100 to take these chimpanzees to the zoo!"   "yes, i know you did," said the blonde. "but we had money left over so now we're going to sea world."	3

donald trump, a jewish rabbi and a hindu monk meet up for peace talks. their talks go on far into the evening, and so, when at last they conclude, they decide to stay the night at the retreat they met at. unfortunately there are only two beds, but there is a barn that they can use as well. "don't worry, guys," says the monk, "i'm used to the simple life. i'll go sleep in the barn."  10 minutes later there's a knock at the door and the monk is standing there. "sorry guys," he says, "but there's a cow in there, and i simply cannot sleep in the same room as such a sacred animal." "ok," says the rabbi. "i'll go instead."  10 minutes later the rabbi is at the door. "sorry, everyone," he says, "but there's a pig in that barn and i really can't spend the night in the company of such an unclean animal." "well," says trump, "i guess i'll have to be the bigger person here. i'll go sleep in the barn."  10 minutes later, a cow and a pig are at the door.	4

'i am sorry if i disturbed you, i have a very rare medical condition; whenever i sneeze i have an orgasm.'    the man, more than a bit embarrassed, was still curious.

a man walks into a bar with a donkey and an ostrich. he sits down at the counter and asks for a beer.  “that will be 5.98$, sir.”, the bartender says.  the man, puts his hand into his pocket and pulls out 5 dollars and 98 cents in exact change.  “how much will it cost to buy everyone here a round of drinks?”, the man asks, taking a sip of his drink.  “that would cost 257.54$, sir.”, the bartender says, looking at the register.  “let  everyone have a round of drinks on me.”, the man replied, pulling out  exactly 257 dollars and 54 cents out of his pocket. “and while you’re at  it, get a bowl of water for my donkey and ostrich.”  everyone in the bar is cheering as they get a free drink.  looking at their reaction, the man goes “eh, fuck it. what is the total tab of all these people in the bar?”  “3325.79$, sir.”, the bartender asks after adding up all active tabs in the bar.  the  man puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out a huge stack of bills and  some coins and hands it over without even counting them.  after counting it, the bartender finds that the man handed over exactly 3325.79$.  now  curious, he asks the man “how is it that you are able to pull out the  exact amount of money needed every time? are you some magician?”  “i’ll tell you if you can keep it a secret.” the stranger replies.  “of course”, the bartender says.  “well,  this happened around a year ago, i was walking by the street next to my  house and tripped over something. i looked back to see what had nearly  made me fall and saw that it was a lamp, all shiny and golden.”  “suddenly, a puff of smoke clouded my vision, when i could see again, there was a genie there!”  “he said ‘now that you have made me free  i shall grant you wishes three.’ now, the most important thing in the  world right now is money, and i thought to just ask for a large sum of  money. i thought about it a little, i realised  that just asking for a large sum of money straight up is kind of  stupid, it would be hard to manage and it would look very suspicious in  my bank account.”  “i  thought about it a little more and decided to ask that whenever i put  my hand in my pocket, i will always have the exact amount of money i  need for that situation in it. this way, i have seemingly infinite money  without the hassles of carrying it around and risking it being stolen.”  the  bartender, now impressed at his way of thinking, says “wow, you seem really smart, i never would have thought of that. you found a creative way to get the benefits of infinite money without any of the dangers.”  “if your first wish was so ingenious, you surely must have asked for something equally clever for your other two wishes. so what did you ask for using your last two wishes?”, the bartender asks.  the man replies, “a chick with long legs and a big ass.”	8

gingerbread house (long) me and my good friend john went camping one time, but after we left our campsite for a walk we got lost. after two weeks of walking around the forest, trying to find our way out, or at least something to eat, we stumble onto a little meadow with a gingerbread house in the middle.  as you can imagine we didn't think twice and went straight to the house and start eating. but our luck was short-lived as an old hag came out of the house with an angry look on her face saying:  "stop! no food for you unless one of you fucks me!"  john, a good husband as he is immediately refuses: "no way, i won't cheat on my wife, i'll rather starve!"  but me.. i don't have a wife and i'm soo hungry.. after a while of thinking i said:  "okay lady, let's go behind the house, i'll do it."   as we got there, the hag pulls her skirt up, and.. it's disguting, there are scabs and pus all over, and i got second thoughts. "i'm not putting my thing in there" i thought to myself, as i see a corn on a cob just sitting there on a window. making sure she doesn't see me i take the cob and do the thing. she screams and laughs and i know that i will finally eat. as she came i threw the cob away so she doesn't see it.  she takes me inside, puts a beautiful meal on the table, as i remember that john is still outside. i go out, find john telling him joyously:  "john, i fucked her, we can eat!"    john looked at me:  "i'm not really hungry anymore. "   with a visible confusion i ask him:  "what do you mean you're not hungry? it's been two weeks now since we last ate real food."  john smiles:  " i was walking behind the house and there it is, a corn on the cob with soooo much butter."	5

a marine returns from duty in iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in afghanistan. that evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.  as he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.  the next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. at the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.  as the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! the naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.  confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...  "these men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over afghanistan." he says, "instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive allah's justice, then return home."  the marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.  after 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.  "hey, my last post was in korea, how is it here?" asks the replacement. "and what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?"  "well, i'll be honest with you", replies the marine, "this a shit post, and what you're looking at here is a criminal punch line."	5

a special table a man went to an old furniture shop to buy an antique kitchen table. almost at once, he saw the table he wanted to buy and asked the price.  “£2,000 sir.”  “never!” exclaimed the man, “that’s unbelievably expensive.”  “that’s true,” replied the assistant, but this is not just any antique kitchen table, this piece of furniture has special powers.”  “get away! show me.”  the assistant went up to the table and said, “how many floors are there in this building?”  immediately, the table jumped into the air four times, and indeed there were four floors in the building.  the man wasn’t totally convinced.  “ok, ask it how much money i’ve got in my wallet.”  the question was asked and the table jumped up and down eleven times.  “that’s incredible,” said the man. “it’s true, i’ve got two £5 notes and a loose £1 coin. i must have that table.”  so the man paid £2,000 and the antique kitchen table was delivered the next day. while it was being installed, his mate popped over and remarked on the piece of new purchase.  “it’s very special,” said the man. “here, i’ll show you.” he thought for a moment and then said, “how much money has my wife got in her bank account?” the table went completely berserk. it started jumping up and down and was still going 30 minutes later.  “but how can that be? where did she get all that money?” he said, flabbergasted.  suddenly, the table stopped moving, its legs fell apart and its drawers fell to the floor.	2

a man walks into a bar... he goes up to the bartender and asks him if he likes to gamble.  the bartender says, "sure, i'll take a bet. what's your action?"  the man offers a $50 bet that he can bite his own eyeball. the bartender, thinking it's easy money, accepts his bet, and is shocked when the man removes his glass eye and bites down on it.  laughing, the man sees that the bartender is upset about losing his money, so he offers him a chance to win it back. "double or nothin' says i can bite my other eye."  the bartender thinks it over. he knows he was just tricked out of $50 but he also knows that this man can't possibly have two glass eyes, so he pulls another $50 from the register and accepts the man's bet.  the man promptly takes out his false teeth and gently closes them around his other eye.  now the bartender is visibly angry to have been had for $100, and the man's laughter isn't helping. just before he throws him out of his bar, the man puts his hand up.  "real sorry about that, pal. i get people with that bit all the time, but you've been a good sport, so i'll give you another chance to win some cash. i've got... $500 that says if you slide a shot glass down the bar top, i can run alongside of it and piss into the glass without missing a drop. this is kinda hard for me to do, though, so i think it's fair if you give me two chances at it."  the bartender, eager to win his money back from the man, thinks to himself and realizes just how hard it would be for this man to piss into a shot glass while running at full speed. especially knowing he only has one eye to line up his shot. after a minute of deliberation, he willingly accepts the bet.  the man drops his pants to his ankles and when the bartender puts the shot glass down on the counter, shouts a resounding, "go!" prompting the bartender to slide it along the bar top.  the man chases after it, holding his dick at an angle to properly aim it. however, pissing while running at full speed isn't easy, so he only manages to get a couple of drops in the glass by the time it reaches the other end.  catching his breath, the man reminds the bartender he has a second try, and that the first was simply to get his bearings straight. once again, he shouts, "go!" giving the bartender his cue to send the shot glass back down the bar. once again, the man chases wildly after it, spraying piss all over the bar top, stools, floor, and even hitting some of the bottles of liquor behind the bar. however, not one drop of urine found it's way into the shot glass. head hanging low, he hands the bartender $500, to which the bartender gleefully accepted, jumping up and down in joy and cheering in victory at the cash he had just made.  all of a sudden, a man in the back of the bar slams his fist hard against his table and screams "fuck!" at the top of his lungs.  the bartender mutters aloud, "i wonder what his problem is."  to which the man replies, "oh, i just bet that guy $10,000 that i could piss all over your bar and you'd be so happy about it you jumped up and down with joy."	7

the rabbi and the sheikh a wealthy sheikh who was travelling in the us met a terrible accident and would need to undergo blood transfusion. the sheikh had a rare type of blood that the doctor's had never encountered before.  they made tests from several donors but found no match, days passed and the sheikh's health was getting worse. finally, on the 7th day, they found the same blood type, a rabbi from the local town.  after a couple of bags was transfused, the life of the sheikh was saved. after hearing what the rabbi did, the sheikh sent generous gifts to the rabbi. these included bricks of gold, tons of cash and luxurious cars he didn't even know existed.   years passed and the sheikh needed blood transfusion again, the rabbi was informed and again without hesitation, donated blood. the sheikh's life has been saved once again, and knowing the donor, he never hesitated to send a "thank you!" letter and a bouquet of flowers.  the rabbi, confused, called the sheikh and asked why he only received a letter and a bunch of flowers, to which he answered, "you see my friend, i now have jewish blood running through my veins."	3
a man is walking home late one foggy night... when behind him he hears:  bump!… bump!… bump!…  walking faster, he looks back and through the fog he makes out the image of an upright casket banging its way down the middle of the street toward him.  bump!… bump!… bump!…  terrified, the man begins to run toward his home, the casket bouncing quickly behind him.  faster… faster…  bump… bump… bump…  he runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him. however, the casket crashes through his door, with the lid of the casket clapping...  clappity-bump… clappity-bump… clappity-bump…  …on his heels, the terrified man runs.  rushing upstairs to the bathroom, the man locks himself in. his heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.  with a loud crash the casket breaks down the door.  bumping and clapping toward him.  the man screams and reaches for something, anything, but all he can find is a bottle of cough syrup!  desperate, he throws the cough syrup at the casket…  and...  the coffin stops.	8

in celebration of my cake day, here's a terrible joke: the olympic swimmer and his son michael was a famous olympic swimmer.  recently retired, it was his dream to continue his legacy by teaching his son the art of swimming.  they had practiced for years, and when michael's son was ready, he was entered into his first ever tournament.      the first round was easy.  after all, the son had been training for years, and had the best coach in the nation.  but, by the time things progressed to the quarterfinals, his times didn't look good.  michael's son was in dead last.      "dad, i don't think i'm going to win this one.  i'm sorry." he said.      "have no fear, son.  i swam in tournaments for years.  i know a few tricks." replied michael.    "tricks? like cheating?" inquired the son.      "no, nothing like that." said michael.  "it's all about aerodynamics.  for example, your swim trunks are medium sized.  go into the locker room and change into a small.  you'll be more streamlined and go faster."      the boy did as instructed, and proceeded to the quarterfinals.  the gun went off, the race started, and the son finished his heat and was able to advance to the semifinals... but only, just barely.      "well, dad, i think that helped, but i think i'm doomed.  even with the extra speed, i can never win the semifinals".      "son, i know another trick.  it's all about aerodynamics.  your noseplugs-- they're too big.  switch your current ones out for a smaller size.  it will reduce the drag on your face in the water and give you a little speed boost."      again, the boy did as he was told, proceeding to the semifinals with smaller nose plugs.  once again, the gun went off, the race started, and the son finished his heat and was surprised to find that he was able to advance to the finals... but only, just barely.      "dad, thank you for all you've done for me.  but, i think i'm doomed.  there's no way i can win now.  i think we're all out of tricks."      "not so, son.  i have one last trick.  it's all about aerodynamics.  you wear a size medium swimming cap.  take it off and wear a smaller size.  it will make you more streamlined and get your blood flowing better.  if you do this, you have a really good chance of winning."      the boy did as instructed.  once again, the gun went off.  the final race began.  the son started out with a massive lead, but then, something unexpected happened.  the son made it halfway through the pool when he unexpectedly started rolling sideways, and then started bobbing up and down like a cork in the water.      "oh no!" michael said.  "capsize!"	5

little timmy comes home from school to find his parents in the middle of a fight. timmy's parents keep him pretty sheltered, and they don't normally fight in front of him, so he stops to see what is going on. the argument is pretty heated and at this point has devolved to plain old shouting insults at one another.  his mother yells at his father "at least i don't have hairy balls!!" this is a new one to timmy and he has to ask "mom, what are hairy balls?" thinking fast his mother replies "coats, timmy. your father has a lot of coats."  not to be outdone, his father shouts back "hairy balls?! at least i don't have saggy tits!!" again, timmy is intrigued. "dad, what are saggy tits?" "shoes, timmy. your mother has a lot of shoes."  timmy's mother is furious. "you bastard!" timmy inquires again, "mom, what's a bastard?" not even caring anymore she just responds "men. like your father."  "bastard, am i? at least i'm not a bitch!!" same thing, timmy asks "dad, what's a bitch?" and his dad, before storming off says "women, just like your mom."  seeing as the combatants have moved on, timmy shrugs and goes to his room to work on homework before dinner. tonight is special because his parents are having some friends over for a nice dinner. once he's done with his homework he gets ready.   once he's ready he heads downstairs. as he's walking past the bathroom his father accidentally cuts himself while he's shaving and it's a good one. "shit!" his father barks, still worked up from the fight earlier. this is another new one for timmy and he doesn't hesitate to ask "dad, what's shit?" "it's shaving cream, timmy. go help your mother in the kitchen." he says dismissively.   timmy gets to the kitchen just in time to hear his mother cry out "fuck!" as she cuts herself carving the turkey she prepared for dinner. good, reliable timmy says "mom, what's fuck?" "carving, timmy. it's just another word for carving."  and just at that moment the doorbell rings. their dinner guests have just arrived. "go get the door timmy, while i finish up here."   timmy, being the helpful boy that he is, trots off to greet their guests. he's proud that he's learned so many new words today and decides that he just has to show off for his parents' friends.  he opens the door and happily says "hello bastards and bitches. may i help you with your hairy balls and saggy tits? dad's upstairs shaving the shit off his face, and mom's in the kitchen fucking the turkey."	3

it's hard times in the old west... (whistle, whistle, whistle) an old west dime novel writer is out looking for a good story when he wanders into a saloon. he sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). "mind if i play?"  the others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. he points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. "play alone, we're a-leavin'. wild bill's comin' to town."  the writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. he hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, "barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change."  after taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. "the drink is on the house, but i suggest you drink it quick and leave. wild bill is coming to town." without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.  now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. this emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...  tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, bong<crack!>- just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. the reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. in the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. the reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.  the wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. he steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face <wham!>, knocking it cold on the ground.  the reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. <kaplow!> the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.  the man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. he looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, "gimme a drink!"  the reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. he throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. the single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.  regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, "w-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?"  the man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... "nah, i gotta go. wild bill's comin' to town."	6

***2020 cancelled*** after careful consideration, we have decided that it is no longer in the best interests of everyone involved to proceed with 2020.  while we recognize that a lot of hard work has gone into preparing for 2020, if we're honest it has just turned into a bit of a sh*tshow and we feel it best just to call it off.  we understand that some of you were looking forward to seeing what cruel and peculiar clusterf**k of a disaster 2020 would throw up next, but on balance we believe it is probably best not to find out.  we will instead provide ticket holders with a full refund or exchange, and start afresh with 2021 on monday.  our plan is to deliver a more enjoyable year, similar to say 2016, which everyone thought was the absolute worst year of all time, but in retrospect was a f**king walk in the park.  see you next year.  the management.	1

one day, as a horse is watching tv... one day, as a horse is watching tv, a music video for "purple haze" by jimi hendrix comes on. the horse falls in love with the song. then, he explores more of jimi hendrix's discography and soon enough he's a full on jimi hendrix fan.  after some time of being a hendrix fan, the horse is inspired to be a guitarist. he gets all the money he has and buys a low-end used stratocaster. he begins to learn how to play, and quickly enough, he knows how to play every jimi hendrix song. he can play every riff flawlessly.  then the horse decides, "this isn't enough". he wants to start a band. he had heard about this chicken who is an absolute beast at bass. so he finds the chicken and he asks him to join him. the chicken, who has a deep passion for music, accepts gladly. the chicken begins to listen to jimi hendrix, and soon enough, he can play the bass of every song perfectly.  but the two needed more band members. there is an older cow on the farm who used to play drums. they ask him, "would you like to join our band?" but the cow seemed sad. the cow said, "i would love to, but i sold my drums some time ago." the horse and chicken decide to buy a drum set for the cow. after they presented him with the drum set, the cow jumped with joy. nostalgia running through his veins, he gets on the drums and rips it. the rumors were true; the cow was a legendary drummer. flattered by the horse and chicken's efforts, the cow couldn't help but join the band. the cow began to listen to jimi hendrix, and could play every one of his songs in no time.  now they have three amazing musicians, but something was missing: vocals. none of them could sing. the chicken then remembers a pig from college who used to be in music class with him. after much searching, they found the pig's whereabouts; it was a farm only 10 miles north! they travel to the other farm and find the pig. he is working on the field in his farm. they say to him, "we're starting a band, but none of us can sing. would you like to join us?" the pig looks at the ground under him, and then at his dirty hooves. he tells them, "since i was a boy, my dream had always been to have a career in music. how i ended up here, i don't know. i'll join, because a career in music is my dream. no matter the risks, i'm on board." and so, the pig joined, and listened to jimi hendrix, and learned every lyric to every jimi hendrix song.  thus started the beginning of the barnyard bros. at first, they were just a jimi hendrix cover band. they received a nice, modest following of fans. they could emulate the jimi hendrix experience flawlessly. the resemblance was uncanny. they were starting to get the ball rolling.  then the horse, the one who started it all, said again, "this isn't enough". they decided that if they were going to be big, it had to be their own music they were playing. they started to write their own music, and eventually recorded their first studio album. and everyone loved it. their fan base was growing faster then they could ever imagine. their album sold over a million copies. number 1 on itunes. number 1 on google play. number 1 played album on spotify. they were everywhere. they were the most popular band in the world.  then one day horse's old farmer gets a call. it's from jimmy kimmel's manager. kimmel wants them on the show. the farmer calls up the horse and tells him of this opportunity. the horse is ecstatic! he and his band get to be on tv! what the horse did not know is that his farmer is a huge jimmy kimmel fan. it's been his dream to attend the show, but he hasn't had the finances to do so. he asks the horse, "please, can you find it in your heart to take me?" the horse loved his farmer very much. his farmer was the one who gave him his job. had it not been for that job, he would have never got that guitar, never started a band, and never would have been in the position he was in. the horse then agrees to take the farmer to see jimmy kimmel, and decides to give a little more. an all expenses paid, week long trip to la, so the farmer can enjoy the city after he goes to the show. the horse flies to la a week before the rest to finalize the deal. he meets with kimmel and his manager and sings the deal. it's official; the barnyard bros will be on the jimmy kimmel show.  soon after, the rest of the band and the farmer get on their flight to la. but tragedy strikes. an engine fails. the plane is losing stability, but can still fly. in a few minutes, the other engine begins failing. the plane begins to plummet. the plane nose dives into the ground and crashes. there are no survivors. everyone, the chicken, the cow, the pig, and the farmer, gone.  the horse hears about the news, and begins to break down in tears. "this is my fault." he said to himself. the horse blamed himself for their deaths because he had started this band. they wouldn't be on that plane if he hadn't had the stupid idea to get the band together and go on the kimmel show. he cancelled his appointment to be on the jimmy kimmel show, as the barnyard bros were no more.  the horse, seeing as his friends were no longer alive, his dreams of a band shot to hell, starts going into a downward spiral. he starts taking whatever he can get. drugs, booze... he did it all. he goes to a bar in la and tells the bartender to just leave the bottle. the bartender looks at the horse. the horse is visibly upset. now the bartender is a nice guy. he doesn't like seeing people in a bad mood and always does his best to help.  so the bartender approaches the horse, and asks him, "hey, why the long face?"	7

a man buys a motorbike and is riding it home when it occurs to him that he's somewhat lacking control, as the wind is getting into his coat and buffeting him quite badly. he pulls over, deciding to put his coat on back-to-front so the openings between the buttons are at the back.   much improved he confidently accelerates away, but within five minutes of riding like this he reaches a sharp bend in the road, where he discovers his arms are rather too restricted in their movement owing to his coat being on backwards and he duly crashes.  many people rush over to his aid. "are you ok?" asks one, a \\[insert member of despised group notorious for having a low-intellect- an 'unfair, ill-deserved and completely unfounded reputation' of your choice here\\].

i dont have any regrets for what i did last year.... it's my humble request to read this calmly before making an opinion about me. and i tell you all again. i have no regret for what i have done.   when i was about 17 or 18, i first noticed that my sister was a hottie. first of all, - just for some background: my mum died right when i was born, (she was actually really, really hot- but this isn't about her. i guess that's fucked up to say, but whatever.) i actually grew up with my dad's family, because my dad has all sorts of emotional issues and he bailed before i was born. so you can see, my childhood was really kind of messed up.  anyways, growing up i feel like there was always a lot of distance between me and my sister. when i was about 17 or 18 i first noticed that my sister was a hottie.  i don't want to go into too many details about it, but basically what happened is that i accidentally found a video that she made of herself. i knew she didn't make it for me- but i thought she was so fucking beautiful that i watched it twice. i probably would have watched it a hell of a lot more, except that like right around the time i found the video, all this crazy shit went down and i had to leave home. (my dad's family who i was staying with got in bad trouble with the law. i never talk about it).  sooo... i was totally lusting after my sister at that point. she was also having bad trouble with the law. she was actually in custody when i left home.  my friend and i went to go pick her up. when i saw her that day, after seeing the video, i have to be honest, i just wanted to fuck her brains out. looking back on it now, it's pretty messed up- but i think she had feelings for me too. she actually kissed me right after we came to get her... and it wasn't a sisterly kiss, you know? i mean, it wasn't like ridiculously sexual or anything, but it definitely wasn't sisterly.  after we left, we all went to crash with my sister's friends. on the trip there, my friend sort of implied that he wanted to get with my sister, and i got a little jealous. he's a good looking guy- and even though she was my sister- i just felt like he was competition. not much else happened between us for a while except some maybe-sexy hugging. pretty much everyone in my life at that point was wanted by the government, so we all moved around a lot. i'm not saying that i'm proud of it or anything, but it was kind of an awesome time.  my friend and my sister never hooked up i don't think- but i thought there was some serious sexual tension going on between them. it was around that time that i got really badly hurt in an accident. it was fucked up. i almost died. but when i was in recovery my sister came to see me, and out of the clear blue sky she started gives me this awesome, slow, passionate kiss on the lips.  sadly (although, i guess for the best) nothing ever came of it. we spent some time apart... and i started to get really religious, so i tried not to think of her that way. it was actually going well for a long time- like i was totally over her.  but i have to say, like a year or so after all that stuff went down, we were out sailing (not like a date or anything romantic like that), and she was wearing like the hottest bikini i've ever fucking seen and it brought back all the old feelings. sigh.  a little while later she actually wound up with my friend from before (the sexual tension guy). i can't say i was surprised. but even after she was shacking up with my friend, there was one time we were at a party... my friend was inside, and my sister and i were outside alone.  it was a really intimate moment. i think something might have happened, except that i killed the mood when i told her that darth vader was our father and that i had to go face him.	1

two aliens land at a deserted gas station... two aliens land at a deserted gas station. they climb out of their space ship and all they can see is a gas pump.   the first alien looks right at the gas pump and says “take me to your leader”.    not surprisingly the gas pump says nothing.   the alien repeats “take me to you leader or i’ll shoot”.  again, no response from the gas pump. the second alien warns his friend that this is a bad idea.   frustrated the first alien says “last chance, take me to you leader before i shoot.”  his friend warns more strongly that this is a bad idea.   having lost his patience, the first alien pulls out his blaster and shoots the gas pump.  there is a huge explosion and the two of them go flying through the air lading 100 feet away.   as they’re laying on the ground the first alien looks at the other and says “how did you know that was a bad idea?”   his friend replied, “any guy who can take his dick, wrap it around his head, and then shove it in his ear is a bad motherfucker!”	6

unusual ornithological behaviour the department of tourism clean-up crew recently found over 200 dead crows off and along interstate 93 near boston and there was concern that they may have died from some sort of covid/avian flu.  a pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was not avian/covid related.  the cause of death in fact appeared to be from vehicular impacts. however, during analysis it was noted that varying colours of paint appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. by analysing these paint residues it was found that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.  the department of safety then hired an ornithological behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. the ornithological behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. they discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout "cah", not a single one could shout "bike."	6

an inventor is about to pass, leaving all he has to his only family. his two children. he was a very altruistic person in life, only using his inventions to help people and not make any profit. his daughter admired this trait and followed this path becoming a tinkerer herself. his son, however, was an opportunist. he would always attempt to make a profit off any of his father's inventions, but would be shut down quickly. this meant that all his father had to his name was his workshop. on his death bed he tells his children that he has a secret invention he was developing on the side lines. he then proposed the choice for them.     "all i have is my stuffy workshop with a few tools to my name, but in the attic is an invention i was working on for years. i finally completed it last week, but kept it for our family."     "it's our personal legacy!" he proclaimed.  the inventor gave them the option right there as he wrote his dying will, the workshop, or his legacy invention? without skipping a beat, the son called for dibs on the invention. the daughter sighed but decided to avoid any conflict and chose to claim the workshop. the son immediately leaves as his father rambles on, setting up meetings with local investors and patent agents about an invention so great that his father would hand it down to him as a family legacy!     later that night the inventor died. the funeral came and went as did the will hearing. each of the children received a key. the daughter, a key for the front door and the son, an ornate key that he had not seen before. the son immediately demanded his sister open the workshop, that he may claim his legacy. she obliged and he rushed in. other than obvious junk and half repaired toys in the attic, there were a pair of long boxes chained together by a gaudy lock. he grabbed the boxes and left the shop.   he called an auction with the many executives he attempted to sell his fathers' previous inventions to where they can witness the unboxing of one so great that he would brand it as his legacy.     the son slips the key into the lock, it doesn't work... at first, but turns it again and the lock snaps open. he puts one of two boxes on the table. everyone leans in as he gently opens the box. finally, he thought, his father's final invention would be the one to make him rich.     he lifts the invention out the box and everyone's excitement turned into confusion. the legacy he left was nothing more than a thigh high stocking strapped with dozens of fans and heat sinks. laughter erupts among the executives ad the son panics, looking for something else in the box. he finds a small sheet of paper folded up, it read - instructions for use and care for your personal leg a/c .	3

so, there's these two tomatoes who are best friends ... ever since they grew up on the vine together, they've been inseparable. they played little league together, they had home room together all through high school, they even double dated to prom and shared a limo. as time went on, though, they slowly lost touch. during university they slowly lost touch with each other. summer break hangouts, regular texting and online gaming slowly became infrequent emails and facebook likes. produce drifts apart, these things happen.  &#x200b;  one day, though, they get to talking again and decide they need to get back together. that after all this time, they're not only going to celebrate their friendship but renew their commitment to stay best friends. no other friends, no ladies, just the two of them. they both plan time off work, travel back to their hometown and go to their favourite bar. they even arranged with the owner to reserve their favourite booth. and it's like they never lost touch. over multiple pitchers of beer they tell all the old stories and share new laughs. just having a great time of things. over the course of the night, though, the first tomato see's this tasty piece of celery eyeing him from the bar. and she is just gorgeous, a real crisp hottie if you get my meaning. and even though he keeps finding her checking him out, he keeps puts her out of his mind as best he can. tonight is just about best tomatoes forever.  &#x200b;  as the night wears one, the second tomato gets up to let out some of the beer they've been drinking. and he's gone maybe 30 seconds when that celery shakes her stalk across the bar and slides into the empty seat to chat up the first tomato. the first tomato is so blinded with flirting with her that he doesn't see second tomato come back. and he is pissed. 'dude, tonight was supposed to be about us', he says, 'and the second i'm gone you ditch me for a bar tramp?'  &#x200b;  the first tomato tries explaining it isn't like that, that she's hitting on him. he tries begging the second tomato to understand, that he'd never have another shot in a million years with someone as hot as her on any other night. he tries suggesting he go home with and that they reschedule their tomatoes night out for another night. the second tomato doesn't like this. furious, he says that if the one night they were going to celebrate all the years they were friends, the one night they were pledging to making an effort to staying as close as they've been, that he's going to ditch him for a girl he won't remember in a week ... then their friendship never really meant anything.  &#x200b;  the first tomato lets the second go, figuring that they'll both cool down and talk tomorrow. he goes back to chatting up the celery up as the night starts to wind down. meanwhile, the second tomato storms off to the other side of the bar and starts doing shots with group of rowdy beefsteak tomatoes, telling them about how his friend betrayed him over a girl. well, you better believe they don't like hearing about their tomato brother getting stabbed in the back like that and decide to do something about it.  &#x200b;  as the first tomato is waiting outside for the celery to finish powdering her leaves, the table of rowdy tomatoes jump him. they pull him down and lay into him, beating him up and down, screaming and berating him the entire time before leaving him in he gutter to die. it's about this time that the second tomato realizes almost everyone's left and decides to head out himself. when he gets outside, though, he sees his best friend laying beaten on the sidewalk, tomato juice running in the gutter. i mean, he's practically ketchup at this point. he hurriedly calls 911 before cradling his friend, crying and praying to god. he holds his friend the entire ambulance ride. at the hospital he spends three hours pacing back and fourth in the waiting room.  &#x200b;  finally, the doctor comes out. and for synchronicity's sake we'll say the doctor is a carrot. the carrot doctor comes up to the tomato and asks if he wants to hear the good news or the bad news.  &#x200b;  the tomato gets really quite for a moment, before whispering through chapped lips that he needs to hear the good news. the doctor says 'well, it was touch and go for a while, and he's not out of the garden yet, but i think he'll live.' the tomato cries out in relief, thanking the doctor profusely. all that matters is that his friend is gonna live, he can take the bad news so long as he'll live. 'what's the bad news, doc?'  &#x200b;  the doctor says 'well, the beating was quite severe. so, he'll live but he'll be a vegetable for the rest of his life.'	4

the advantages of breast milk the not necessarily well-prepared student sat in his life science classroom staring at a question on the final exam paper.   the question directed: 'give four advantages of breast milk.' what to write? he sighed, and began to scribble whatever came into his head, hoping for the best:   1. no need to boil.   2. cats can't steal it.   3. available whenever necessary.   so far so good - maybe. but the exam demanded a four-part answer. again, what to write? once more, he sighed. he frowned. he scowled, then sighed again. but suddenly, he brightened. he grabbed his pen, and triumphantly, he scribbled his definitive answer:   4. available in attractive containers.	5

a man and a dog, and the extremely unusual funeral... a man and his wife are walking down the town main street. they are arguing, as they always do, about the efficiency of wearing masks during the pandemic.  however, they have to stop because of a funeral procession that is actively going on. the procession was extremely unusual... everyone is walking, the first family are carrying a very nice mahogany wood casket, then about 10 yards behind there is a second group carrying a second wooden casket, cheaper wood this time, but it's two caskets there... after the second casket a solitary, sad man is walking with his dog.  however, after the man there are about 500 people, oddly all walking in a straight line right behind the man...  the man who was arguing with his wife, stops arguing and decides to approach the man, with a lot of respect he decides to ask about this very unusual funeral... so he approaches the man with the lovely looking dog.  man: excuse me, i know this is not best moment to ask, but i have never seen a funeral like this... who is this funeral for?  man with dog: i understand, well my wife is in the first casket...  man: so sorry to hear, may i ask what happened to her?  man with dog: my dog attacked her, and killed her.  \\*they both keep walking a bit, but the man asks...  man: so who is in the second casket?  man with dog: my mother in law....  man: oh wow... i am so sorry to hear... what happened to her?  man with dog: well, she was trying to help my wife, and the dog turned against her and killed her as well...  man (after a brief pause, thinking hard...): sir, may i borrow your dog for a day?  man with dog: to the back of the line!	6

i found some dusty old boxes in my closet and in them were old family relics. my great-great grandfather's world war one helmet was the first thing i saw... there was also my grandmother's surgical gear when she was a nurse in the local hospital and countless heirlooms i can't possibly list all of which.  then, i got to the one that sparked the most memories: my grandfather's most prized collection!!  every day since january 1st, 1949, he collected ties with funny designs and wore them to work.   some had cats or snakes or airplanes.  he had close to 100 by the time he died several years ago.   i remember as a kid how much i loved them, he had stories of what happened to him while he wore those ties.   he had an awesome memory and was good at telling stories.  when he passed, he left them to me.  i couldn't keep all 100 so i gave some to my cousins, but i decided to keep the ties that were his absolute favorites, his chicken pattern ties.  the day he wore his first chicken tie was when he met my grandmother.   from then, he collected more chicken ties to remind him of her.   i wear them every now and again, as well.  thanks for reading this.   i like to talk about them, but all my friends act weird when i tell them about my granddad's hen tie collection.	6

"i knocked up the poodle next door.  she's a purebred with papers so the neighbors are suing my family.  i'm here to get fixed as well." replies the mutt. "how about you?" he asks the lab.  "last night after getting undressed my mistress dropped her earring.  it rolled under her bed.  she got down and crawled under to get it but her hair got stuck.  i was really worried about her at first but then all i could think about was how good she looked naked and down on all fours.  so i mounted her.  she was still stuck and couldn't do anything to stop me so i went all the way."  "you mean...?"  "yep.  i nutted in that bitch like she was the collie down the street."  "wow."  says the mutt. "you almost can't be mad at her for sending you to get fixed."  "oh i'm not here to get fixed," says the lab looking at his paw, "i'm just here for a nail trim."	5

"i am the pope" he answers. "the pope?" peter mutters "i am sorry, but i don't have a pope in my book."  "but i am god's deputy on earth, head of the catholic church!" the pope insists. "the catholic church? no clue what you mean. but wait, i go and ask the boss."  peter goes to god and reports: "lord, there is someone at the gate who calls himself pope. he says he is your deputy on earth and mentioned a catholic church." "never heard of it" is god's response "but wait, i will ask my son! jesus!" he called.  jesus came running to his father and god and peter explained the situation. "i don't believe it!" jesus gasped "remember the small fishing club i founded 2000 years ago? this thing is still around!"	3

bored at work so i wrote my first joke. it’s extremely dumb but maybe it’ll make someone laugh. an extremely wealthy family owned countless successful companies, bought out competitors and even purchased new ventures if they looked promising enough. nothing was too big or small, and nothing was off limits.  the family consisted of a mother (linda), father (robert) and 3 sons (robert jr., louis & clarence). robert jr. and louis were in their late twenties and intelligent beyond their years. they were primed to lead the family when the time came. clarence wasn’t as smart or successful as his older brothers, but he strived to prove everyone wrong. he wanted to help lead this family into the future alongside his brothers.  linda and robert tasked the three brothers with purchasing three more companies to put under the family umbrella. they each had a budget of $50 million and set out on their own paths to make their parents proud. they were given 7 days to acquire their respective businesses.  clarence ran out of the room as fast as he could, jumped in his porsche and took off. he already had a place in mind. he heard about a massive new waste disposal company that just moved into town last year. they were known for their environmentally friendly practices and the company was already  profitable. it was perfect.  after 7 days, a family meeting was held where each of the brothers were to present and introduce their newest acquisitions. robert jr. insisted he go first. he proudly stated, “mother, father, i’ve taken an up-and-coming lumber yard, as you can see on my chest. it’s called alpha lumber.” he points to his left chest and shows off his new polo shirt with the alpha lumber logo beautifully showcased. louis insisted he presented next, “nicely done, brother,” he says, “but it’s not as promising as mine. mother, father, i’ve taken a software and technology company, as you can see on my chest. it’s called gigabite and is projected to rival microsoft within the decade.” he points to his own chest, revealing the new gigabite logo.  clarence, eager to prove himself nearly cut his brother off so he could take the floor. he began,    “mother, father, i’ve taken a massive dump, as you can see on my chest...”	7

the chicken and the horse (dirty, long) on a farm lived a chicken and a horse, good friends who enjoyed long leisurely walks together.   one day, their walk brought them to a swamp, in which the horse started to sink. "quickly!" he cried, "run to the farmer's garage, throw a rope into his bmw, drive it over here, tie me to it, and pull me out!" the chicken, following the horse's directions, successfully saves the horse from drowning in the swamp.   days later, on another walk, they once again happen upon the swamp, and this time, the chicken gets stuck. "quick!" she cries, "get me out, same as i did you!"  "fortunately," the horse answered, "i don't need the rope, or the car." he then proceeded to pull the chicken out by extending his penis out for her to grab onto, thus saving her from sinking in the swamp.   the moral of the story is, when you're hung like a horse, you don't need a beamer to pick up chicks.	2

"he's not going to, i knew he wouldn't." she said to him.  "well i guess you're right." said the man in a defeated tone.   finally the man picks up the frog and says,  "i'm only going to show you how to do this one more time."	7

every day, a barber sweeps outside his store and without fail, at the same time each day, a boy walks up. the boy always comes by and the man offers him a dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other. time and time again the boy always takes the quarter. the man keeps doing it out of curiosity because the boy always chooses the quarter. so, eventually he tells his clientele, “every day when i sweep outside there’s this dumb boy that comes by and i offer him a dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other, and he always chooses the quarter. what a sucker!” his customers don’t believe this, and they wait to watch it in person.  sure enough after work when the man is sweeping outside the boy comes walking up again. the man shows him one dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other, and the boy chooses the quarter and walks off. the customers are left dumbfounded. “see, that dumb kid always chooses the quarter! what a sucker!”  the next day, the same thing happens again. the man shows a dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other hand, and again the boy takes the quarter. dumbfounded for the last time, the man can’t take it any longer and asks the boy, “boy, why is it, when i offer you a dollar in one hand and a quarter in the other, you always take the quarter?”  the boy replies, “because if i took the dollar the game would be over.”	5

red car day red car day - in honor of my dad  my dad died 7 years ago. he was a worker in a factory in nyc during the by-gone, post-war era when times were good and jobs were plenty. the guys he worked with were all good friends over the years and enjoyed harmless pranks against one another to pass the time. this is one of his best stories which i told at his eulogy.  there was a new guy, jim, who joined the crew the summer of ’74 who became an instant comrade. the jokesters of the crowd - my dad amongst them - decided after a month or 2 it was time for a prank.  it’s important to recall in those days there were no cell phones, computers, google, ezpass computerized toll collection, nothing. if you needed to go anywhere back then you needed physical directions “go a mile down the road and at the gas station make a left.” even toll roads (bridges and such) had people manning them and if you dared speed through, there were dedicated patrol cars who would chase after you, get the toll and give you a ticket, right then and there.  they decided to invite him to the end of summer cookout traditionally given by ben, one of the men at my dad’s job. jim was told that ben lived in a remote area where even a physical map wasn’t going to help nearing his house.   “you’ve got to follow someone on the highway to get there because the exits get really tricky,” they told jim. he asked my dad if he could follow him to the cookout.   dad: “sure,” my dad said. “by the way, what color car do you have?” my dad asked rather matter of factly.   jim: “well, red i guess. why?”   d: “you lucky sob. the cookout is on the 19th, it’s red car day on the highway that day.”  j: “red car day?! what the hell are you talking about?”  d: “what are you living under a rock? the highway has free toll days for red, black, yellow and blue cars on the 2nd, 14th, 19th and 22nd of every month during the summer.”  j: “i never heard of that. why the hell do they do that?”  d: “when they were building this highway back in the 40s there were 4 deaths, and those 4 men are honored with free tolls on the days they died. 3 months out of the year they give people with red, black, yellow and blue cars (the color of the cars the men had) free tolls to honor the brave men who died building the very road you’re driving on.”  j: “wow! that’s quite a story. i had no idea. i have to admit i don’t travel that road very but that is really very nice to honor them that way.”   so, jim made arrangements to follow my dad (with me, my brother and mom in the car with him) on the 22nd of august.   as we got onto the highway, my dad made sure to drive slow enough to not lose jim and be absolutely certain jim was right behind my dad as they approached the toll plaza. my dad rolled down the window to pay the toll saying to the clerk, “i’m paying for me and guy directly behind me.”  as my dad drive away slowly, jim inched up not really sure what was going to happen. however, the toll booth clerk just waved her hand as if to say “go ahead” and jim, a tad startled at first, hit the gas and went.  my dad giggled a bit, then made sure to keep driving slow enough to not lose jim as they approached the second toll plaza. my dad said to the clerk, “this is for me and guy directly behind me.”  as my dad drive away slowly, you could see jim was more confident but still cautious. however, as the toll booth clerk waved his hand “go ahead” jim hit the gas, this time a smile crawling across his face. he gained up to my dad in no time.  the traffic was getting a bit thicker now and my dad used this traffic to partially lose jim, but make sure he could still see him. approaching the next toll plaza, my dad was in a different lane than jim. my dad stopped and paid the toll while jim sailed through the toll lane. you could hear the audible alarm of a toll-jumper, and the black-n-white police car in hot pursuit of jim.   my dad pulled away slowly from the toll catching up to jim hearing him arguing with the cop, “yeah, it’s red car day.”  the funniest part was hearing jim tell his side of it at the bbq. all the fellas chipped in to pay the fine.   :-)	3

a laotian businessman opened a small store in london. he was very quiet and diligent with his bookkeeping. he always made sure to help out his employees when he could, typically hiring other laotians in the area who were struggling to find work.  among these employees was a group of three friends from surrey. although they were a bit rowdy and somewhat lazy, the owner had trouble finding other local applicants, and didn't want to appear partial to laotians.  when it came time for yearly bonuses, none of the three men received a share. the first friend stormed into the owner's office.  "how come we don't get a fuckin' bonus? we work here the same as everyone else!"   the owner sighed and looked back at his papers, replying in broken english "none of you concerned it."   when the worker went back to tell his friends, the second man broke into his office. "the fuck you mean it's none of our concern?! that's our money, same as everyone else!"  again, the owner shook his head, not even looking up. "none of you concerned it."  after telling his friends he got the same broken reply, the third friend had had enough. throwing open the door, he slammed his fist on the desk.  "now look, you old wanker. i don't know how you ran things in laos, but here, when someone does a good job and doesn't get a bonus, it's sure as shit not 'none of our concerned it!'" he shouted, mocking the owner's accent.  the owner sighed, pulled off his glasses and faced the man. "that's all well and good," he said. "however, i worked very hard to get to this point, earning two master's degrees in business and english."  he went back to his papers. "so feel free to look for another job. but trust me when i say that none of you cunts earned it."	7

a guy goes to his doctor for elbow pain... the doctor gives him a specimen cup and requests a urine sample. “but doc, i’ve got elbow pain, why do you need a urine sample?” doc assures him,”we have the latest in technology, just go to the men’s room and give me a sample”, which he does. the doctor pours it in the top of a complex analysis unit and a short time later, it spits out a tape reading. doctor looks at it and says, “ you have tennis elbow”. “that’s ridiculous” he says’ “i don’t play tennis!” doctor informs him it’s just a term for tendinitis in the elbow and sends him home with instructions not to overuse his arm and return in two weeks.  the guy returns two weeks later and the process is repeated. the doctor sends him home with the same instructions.  after several visits like this the guy is certain the doctor is just racking up billable hours, so before he goes to his next appointment he; has his wife pee in a can; his daughter pee in a can, catches his dogs pee in a can; puts some used oil from his car in the can and, for good measure; jacks off in it. he then hides it in the men’s room before the nurse takes him back to the examining room.    when the doc hands him the sample cup, he doesn’t question it and goes to the men’s room, pees in the cup and adds some of his stash to it, returning it to the doctor who blindly pours it in.  the unit goes freakin nuts; smoking, whirring, lights flashing, alarms going off-so the doctor asks him to have a seat in the waiting room.  an hour later the guy is called back, a smirk on his face and the doctor pulls out a two-foot long printout and reads the diagnoses: your wife, sarah, has syphilis; your daughter, tina, is pregnant; your dog, jack, has cancer; your 2016 bmw is low on oil..............and if you don’t quit whacking off you’ll *never* get rid of that tennis elbow!	5

a man accepts a job in a village with no women once there, he asks a local:  -there are really no women here?  -none.  -so... what do you guys do when you need to have sex?  -there is a donkey close to the river for that.  the man tries to ignore that and goes home, from where he can see the river and therefore, the donkey. after months in that village, every day the donkey seems a little more attractive, so one day when a few other men ask him if he'd like to go to the donkey with them, he accepts. when he is close to the donkey, the man pulls down his pants and one of the other locals yells:  -what are you doing!?  -aren't we...you know? going to do the donkey thing?  -we going to ride the donkey across the river so we can get to the other village where we can meet women.	8

my favorite uncle told this joke about a week before he passed away. he did it with a thick irish brogue. a priest and a nun were talking and the priest said, “sister, if you hadn’t been a nun what do think you would have been?” the nun thought for a minute and said, “if i hadn’t been a nun i probably would have been a prostitute.” the priest was shocked and said, “now sister i don’t think i heard you quite right. i’ll ask you again. if you hadn’t been a nun what would you have done with your life?” the nun turned to him and said, “father if i’ve told you once i’ve told you a thousand times if i hadn’t been a nun i would’ve been a prostitute.” the priest said, “oh thank me stars. for a minute i thought i heard you say you would have been a protestant.”	1

a man walks into a bank he's accompanied by a broker. the man asks to speak to someone about making a large deposit, so the banker sends him straight to the boss.  "good morning," says the man, "i'm here to deposit $40,000.  "well now," says the banker, "how did you acquire such funds? we like to keep a clean note system here."  "not to worry," the man spoke assuredly, " the money i make is essentially winnings. see, i'm a gambler of sorts."   "oh really?" the banker, who is also a gambler, inquires. "how so?"  "let's have a wager shall we? i'll bet you a grand i can lick my eyeball."   the banker thought surely this was the quickest grand he would ever make, and shakes the man's hand. to his surprise, the man popped out his left eyeball, a fake, and licked it, and out it back into his socket.   "well i'll be..." the banker exclaimed, mildly furious he fell for that.   "but wait, i'll bet you another 5 grand i can bite my ear."   without hesitation the banker agreed, and to his distraught the man pulled  out his dentures and clamped them to his ear, and put them back into his mouth.   "you slimy weasel, i should've seen that coming." the banker exclaimed, now turning red in the face.  "i've got one more wager, how about......" he paused for a moment. "i bet 10k that i can stand in that corner of the room, and piss into the mug on your desk, and not get a single drop anywhere."  "bet."  the man proceeded to the corner, unzipped his pants, and proceeded to piss literally everywhere in the bankers office, including the banker himself. the only place he didn't was in the cup.  "ha!" the banker yelled with excitement, that was the easiest 10 grand i've ever made!"  "indeed," said the man, "i bet my broker here 50,000 that i could piss all over you and you would love it."	4

two scotsmen go to hell [i know this joke has been shared a few times before but i thought i would share my scottish cultural adaptation of it]  a demon approaches the devil and says "dark lord! two men from glasgow in scotland have been sent here. what should be done with them?"  the devil says "glaswegians? their kind are normally very friendly, helpful and honest, so we do not see many such men in my dark domain... hang them in a cage over the lake of fire for now and i shall check on them later."  but when the devil flew up to the cage to check on the scotsmen, he found them happily lounging around with their shirts off.  "what is the meaning of this?" the devil cried. "you're supposed to be in torment!"  the glaswegians looked surprised "naw" they said "it's pure quality taps aff weather here man. it's no drab an' dreek like scotland, you know that way?"  fuming, the devil flew to the great thermostat of hell and cranked it all the way to the top. and the next day, the temperature was so high that even the demons were sweating, the stones of hell were melting and the flames from the lake of fire were leaping higher than ever before.  so the devil was surprised when he visited the scotsmen and found that they had somehow procured plastic lawn furniture and buckfast tonic wine.   raising a glass to the devil, one of the scotsmen said "hey big man! if i'd known it was so lovely an warm doon here, i'd've done a whole lot more sinning! weather's always shite in gladgae. always freezin' ma nuts off, you know?"  "i see." the devil replied, smiling though clenched teeth "your dismal country has given you a great love of heat. the hotter it is, the happier you are. well, we'll see about that."  so saying, he flew to the great thermostat of hell once more, but this time, he turned it all the way down.  the next day, the lake of fire was frozen solid for the first time, sinners were frozen in blocks of ice and demons huddled in corners for warmth, their teeth chattering.  but when the devil visited the scotsmen, he found them jumping for joy, tearfully cheering "scotland! scotland!!!"  the devil's jaw dropped. "what? why? how? i burn you and you are happy! i freeze you and you celebrate! what is wrong with you?"  one of glaswegians turned back and said "is it no feckin' obvious ye daft bastart? hell's frozen over! scotland's won the world cup!"	6

voodoo dildo a man walks into a sex shop and tells the shopkeeper that he'll be going on a trip soon. he tells the shopkeeper that his wife is very sexually active, and to keep her happy he wants to get her something to keep herself busy. the shopkeeper goes to the backroom and brings the man a box. the shopkeeper tells the man that "within this box is a voodoo dildo, and all you have to do is say voodoo dildo, and then the thing you want it to thrust into."   the man hesitant but hopeful purchased the dildo and returned home to his wife. later before he left, he gave his wife the dildo and told her how to work it. the wife was also hesitant but interested to find out how it worked. the man left for his trip, and with his wife alone for a few days, she began to become more and more lustful. longing for some kind of release, she turned to the voodoo dildo. she opened the box, sat on the bed and followed her husband's instruction. she said to the dildo: "voodoo dildo my vagina.". the dildo slowly rose from its case, and then hovered over to the woman, and began to pleasure her. after an hour or two of nonestop thrusting, the woman was thoroughly satisfied, but when she went to take it out, it simply continued..   not sure of what to do, after a few more moments the woman began to panick, as it this point the voodoo dildos constant thrusting was less pleasurable than it was greatly concerning. she hopped into her car and decided to drive to the nearest medical facility, driving quite sporadically as the voodoo dildos unrelenting thrusting was making it hard for her to focus. a few moments passed and she was spotted and pulled over by a law enforcement officer..   as he came up to her car the woman began to panic even more... seeing this, the officer asked the woman what was wrong, as her reckless driving was completely unacceptable. the woman, not knowing what to say simply spouted "i'm sorry officer, but i was driving so recklessly because of the voodoo dildo constantly f*cking me."   the officer with a confused and frustrated expression leaned into the car, and told the woman with a dissatisfied look...  "voodoo dildo my ass!"	1

"what makes you say that?" asked the farmer.  "well," said the surgeon, "god removed a rib from adam and turned it into eve."  "you are forgetting one thing," said the farmer. "before god even created adam, he planted a garden for adam to live in. that makes agriculture the oldest career."  "both of you are wrong," said the engineer. "engineering is the oldest career because god created an entire universe out of nothing but pure chaos."  "ha ha! i win!" taunted the lawyer.  "what makes you say that?" asked the surgeon.

"oh. that's nice," says the bartender. then he says to the second duck "hi, and what's your name?" "dewey," came the answer. "so how's your day been, dewey?" "great. lovely day. had a ball. been in and out of puddles all day. if i had the chance another day i would do the same again." so the bartender turns to the third duck and says, "so, you must be louie."

jokes are like frogs because if you dissect them, they die. except to use the word "dissect" implies the frog or joke in question is already dead. the correct word choice would be "vivisect," which is the equivalent of a dissection, but with the animal (or joke) still alive. much like a dissection, vivisections are used mostly for research purposes. with this in mind, one should say, "jokes are like frogs, if you vivisect them, they die." see what i did there? i took the common phrase of "jokes are like frogs, if you dissect them, they die" and i vivisected it. one would think that i in fact dissected it, but as i previously explained, the joke was very much alive before i started my explanation, thus making it a vivisection.	7

you have 10 birds in the tree if one gets shot how many left? here the programmer version   you have 10 birds in a tree. you shot one. how many are left?  there is a programmer version for this question:  one day, when the teacher wanted to test the students' iq in class, he asked a boy, "there are 10 birds in a tree. you shot one. how many are left?"  the boy asked, "is it a silent pistol, or other guns without sound?"  "no, it has gunshot."  "how loud is the gunshot?"  "80-100 decibels."  "that is to say, the sound of the gunshot will make your ears ache?"  "yes."  "is it illegal to shoot birds in this city?"  "no, it won't break the law."  "are you sure that bird was really killed? how do you verify that?"  "sure." the teacher is impatient. "please, tell me how many are left, ok?"  "ok. are there any deaf one in the birds?"  "no."  "is there a bird with mental problems in it, which too stupid to know to fly away when it hear the gunshot?"  "no, they all have an iq of more than 200!"  "are there any birds kept in cages?"  "no."  "are there any other trees by the side and any other birds on the trees?"  "no."  "how about…ten miles around?"  " there are just such a tree! "  "are there any disabled or hungry birds that can't fly?"  "no, their health and body all in great shape."  "do we count the birds in the pregnant belly? can they also be counted as one?"  "they are all male."  "they can't be pregnant?"  "no... it's impossible. "  "is the shooter dazzling? is his eyesight good? how does he make sure 'they are ten birds'? "  "he has no dim eyesight or blurred vision. there are only ten birds." the sweat on the teacher's forehead has come down,  after class, the bell rang, but the boy continued to ask, "are there any birds that are too stupid to be afraid of death?"  "no. they all are afraid of death."  "did some of them choose to stay and ready to die, because his lover was shot?"  "fool, i said that they were all male!"  "is homosexuality ok? how do you determine their sexual orientation? "  “... their sexual orientation is hetero! "  "will he kill two birds with one shot?"  "no."  "kill three birds with one shot?"  "no!"  "how about four?"  "no!!"  "and five?"  "absolutely not!!!"  ...  "will the bullet have knocked out the tree? if there were no trees, there would be no birds! "  "no. it's just an ordinary pistol which is not so powerful. "  "... well, are all the birds free to fly? "  "absolutely yes."  "will they panic and bump into each other when they take off?"  "no, every bird has installed a satellite navigation system, and it can fly automatically."  "well, if your reply is not deceiving me…" this student replied confidently, "if the dead bird is hanging on a tree and does not fall from it, there will be one left; if he falls, there will be no one left."  the teacher tried to resist his feeling of fainting, and said with trembling: "you can become a programmer..."	4

a perfectly triangular lake has 3 kingdoms on its 3 sides.  the first kingdom is rich and powerful, filled with wealthy, prosperous people, the second is more humble, but has its fair share of wealth and power. the third kingdom is struggling and poor, and barely has an army.  the kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. the first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. the second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. the third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire.  the night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. the knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night.  in the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. he fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight.  the next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. in place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. the battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom.  and it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.	8

[oc] a programmer walks into a coffee shop a programmer walks into a coffee shop on his lunch break with his pet, a black labrador. he comes in with a scowl on his face and a furrowed brow, his expression showing a frustrated yet pensieve look about him. he asks for a plain, black coffee.     the barista compassionately eyed the man for a moment and asked, "excuse me, i can't help but notice you seem seem upset, is everything alright?" the programmer replies, "yeah, yeah i'm fine... i just have this project at work where i need to integrate several complicated functions into one software application, but they're all written in different languages and nothing i do seems to work!" the barista understandingly smiles, and suggests he go walk his dog and mull things over. he thanks her, and decides it would be a good idea to get some fresh air and get some circulation going after sitting for so long in front of his computer at work, so he sets out on a short trek down the nearby street.     incidentally, he walks past a pet shop, and upon seeing the animals in the window, his dog, stops, turns to his owner and begins to bark excitedly. "you want to go in boy?" he asks. "come on, let's go check it out."      the dog immediately makes for the window section of the shop he had seen from outside, which contained a large, dull brown colored constrictor snake. the top of the enclosure was open, and not very high off the ground, which the programmer's dog took full advantage off, sprinting headfirst to get to the snake. the programmer, surprised by the sudden explosive movement, spills the rest of his coffee, getting it everywhere - all over his shirt, the floor, and even both of   animals got  in front of him got splashed with the  now-lukewarm brew.      immediately, the dog whimpered and retreated from the  mess as far as the leash would allow him, and the snake recoiled and likewise put as much distance between him as he could to the puddle of coffee that had formed in the enclosure. the pet shop owner jogged over to clean it up, and, amid profuse apologies, waved down the programmer's offer to help  and said it was all okay, no real harm was done. as soon as the coffee had been mopped up, though, the dog went back to trying to get at the snake, but now the man was ready and held the leash back a safe distance.      "hmph" the programmer grunted. "this is just like my project at work. the matte lab, the python, and the java elements are not compatible with each other".	2

itching powder once upon a time there lived a beautiful queen with large breasts.  syd, the dragon slayer, obsessed over the queen for this reason. he knew that the penalty for his desire would be death, should he try to touch them, but he had to try.  one day syd revealed his secret desire to his colleague, nathan the erudite lawyer, the king's chief adviser. nathan thought about this and said that he could arrange for syd to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 100 gold coins to arrange it. without pause, syd readily agreed to the scheme.  the next day, nathan got a batch of itching powder and poured a little bit into the queen's bra while she bathed. soon after she dressed, the itching commenced and grew intense.  upon being summoned to the royal chambers to address this incident, nathan informed the king and queen that only a special saliva, if applied for four hours, would cure this type of itch, and nathan advised that only the saliva of syd would work as the antidote to cure the itch.  the king, eager to help his queen, quickly summoned syd to their chambers. nathan then slipped sid the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, syd worked passionately on the queen's large and magnificent breasts. the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and syd left satisfied and hailed as a hero.  upon returning to his chamber, syd found nathan demanding his payment of 100 gold coins. with his obsession now satisfied, syd couldn't have cared less knowing that nathan could never report this matter to the king and with a laugh told him to get lost.  the next day, nathan slipped a massive dose of the same itching powder into the king's underwear. the king immediately summoned syd.	5

yoda and luke are walking through the swamp. part of their usual training course involves shimmying along a cliff ledge, but today, there’s a long break in the ledge they can’t cross...   “something for this i have.” yoda says. he reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape.  he tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.  when they get back to yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around yoda’s garden.  “something i have for this.” yoda says again. once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.  yoda and luke return to yoda’s home, where yoda looks through his bag. he’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.  “that’s ok master." luke says, wanting to be helpful. “i’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”  so he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.  he looks down at yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.  “master yoda!” he asks. “what did i do wrong?”  yoda replies sagely, “a jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. never for a tack!”	8

"i didn't want to kill the beast in front of my little girl, who was with me for the trip. so, i growled at the lion." the king continued.  "then what happened?" a courtier asked.  "the lion growled back to me but i growled back, even harder. the lion was taken aback by my deep and loud growling so it turned around and ran away," the king said proudly.  "wow, the lion ran away by just king's growling." the courtiers said to  each other, impressed.  suddenly, a boy came running in. " your highness, a lion just entered the town. what should we do?"  "i'm not afraid of a lion. let me know when it comes to the palace." the king said. the boy nodded and ran.   after a few minutes, the boy came back. "your highness, the lion just entered the palace gates".  the courtiers were stunned by the news.  "no need to be afraid, i'm here. let me know when the lion enters the palace." the king said. the boy nods and leaves.  after a few minutes he comes back. "your highness, the lion is here."he said pointing at a huge lion at the entrance of the court.   it was the biggest beast the king ever saw. the courtiers were afraid and looked to their king to save them. the lion walked in.  with no other option, the king growled at the lion. the lion kept on walking.  sweat starts forming on king's forehead. he growled again, but louder. 'aaarrgggh".  the lion kept on walking with a mean look on his face. the courtiers were trembling with fear but had trust on their king.   drenched with sweat, the king growled again with all his strength. "aarrrgghhhhrrrowwwllll".  unaffected, the lion kept on walking.  suddenly, the king jumped up and shouted. " run! the lion is fucking deaf!"	8

a new guy starts to work at a bakery he's handed his rota and his eyes lighten up: "great, it's dinner-roll day!". the supervisor is puzzled to see such enthusiasm for so mundane a task as baking dinner rolls, but sure enough, the new guy goes to it with zest and panache and is soon turning out dinner rolls the like of which the supervisor has never seen or tasted, imaginatively designed and with a taste and texture beyond all praise or even description.  it's the same again the next day when the new guy comes in and looks at the rota: "wow, wholemeal loaf day!". and sure enough, he puts the same verve and expertise into making wholemeal loaves as he did into dinner rolls the day before, and soon they are selling like something for which there ought to be a suitable simile when you're telling a story about a bakery.  on the wednesday he takes one look at the words "danish pastry day" on the rota and immediately bursts into song, turning out tray after tray of beautifully formed and succulent danish pastries, and on thursday the excited shriek of "doughnut day! yes!!!" heralds an eight-hour shift of doughnuts that god himself would forgive the sins of a whole world for.  but on friday:  "i don't understand it," says the disappointed supervisor to the master baker. "it's his cake day and he's made barely any effort at all."  thanks to u/gil-gandel  also i was able to get 6,660 karma on this day which is fun	6

"  the businessman replied calmly, "i went there with intentions of getting tested, i thought it was free, but they asked me for $150!"  his partner was reminded of his partner's stingy nature, yet he felt frustrated by this. he asked, "so what are you going to do now?"  the businessman replied with a very calm and proud tone, "well, don't worry about that! while i was talking to the doctor i sneezed on him. now i'm waiting for his result!"  &#x200b;  &#x200b;  ps: i just translated this fresh joke from my native language. hope it's translated well and you liked it.  also, i stay in a country where a couple of months ago we had to pay a lot for corona tests.	6

once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.  sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.  and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note...  and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note. people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. words cannot do justice to the experience. the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings.  and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday. all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note. from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there.  suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted! the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. soon the entire monastery was aflame. by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.  the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.  the mayor approached the lead monk of the order. "what happened?" he asked, exasperated.  the old monk shook his head sadly. "isn't it obvious?" he said. "sam sung note 7."	6
the rain was pouring and there was a big puddle in front of the pub. a ragged old man was standing there with a rod and hanging a string into the puddle.  a curious gentleman came over and asked what he was doing. "fishing", the old man said simply. "poor old fool", the gentleman thought, and he invited the ragged old man to a drink in the pub.   he felt he should start some conversation while they were sipping their whiskey, so he asked the old man, "and how many have you caught?"   "you're the eighth", the old man answered.	8

my dad used to abuse my mom (long) as a little kid, i remember countless nights of being awake at night scared by all the yelling and screaming downstairs. a few times my mom would be bruised on her arms. i'd ask her about it and she wouldn't say anything.  one day she got the courage to call the police and have him taken away to prison. my dad served a 6 year sentence. surprisingly my mom was gonna stay with him when he got out. she had waited for him despite all the pain of the past.  however when my dad rang the doorbell upon coming back from prison, we found him wearing pink lipstick, a blonde wig and a sundress. my mom and i were so shocked at the sight of him.  taken aback, my mother asked "what happened to you?!"  my dad replied, "well i've learned my lesson from the past and am determined to be better. abusing you was very wrong and i'll never do it again. but you know what they say: if you can't beat 'em, join 'em."	1

a woman was at her hairdresser's getting her hair styled for a trip to rome with her husband. she mentioned the trip to the hairdresser, who responded:  "rome? why would anyone want to go there? it's crowded and dirty. you're crazy to go to rome. so, how are you getting there?”  "we're taking united” was the reply. "we got a great rate!”  “united?" exclaimed the hairdresser. " that's a terrible airline. their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. so, where are you staying in rome?”  "we'll be at this exclusive little place over on rome's tiber river called taste.”  "don't go any further. i know that place. everybody thinks it's gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump.”  "we're going to go to see the vatican and maybe get to see the pope.”  "that's rich," laughed the hairdresser. ”you and a million other people trying to see him. he'll look the size of an ant. boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. you're going to need it.”  a month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. the hairdresser asked her about her trip to rome.  "it was wonderful," explained the woman, "not only were we on time in one of united’s brand new planes, but it was overbooked, and they bumped us up to first class. the food and wine were wonderful, and we had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on us hand and foot..  and the taste hotel was great! they'd just finished a $5 million remodeling, and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. they, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!”  "well," muttered the hairdresser, "that's all well and good, but i know you didn't get to see the pope.”  "actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the vatican, a swiss guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if i'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the pope would personally greet us.  sure enough, five minutes later, the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! i knelt down and he spoke a few words to me..”  "oh, really! what'd he say?”  he said: "who fucked up your hair?	8

"correct," said dr. parker.  "and now, miss smith, i have three things to say to you.  one, you have not studied your lesson.  two, you have a dirty mind.  and three, you will some day be faced with a dreadful disappointment."	8

what a set up, for a dad joke. it's worth it tho full disclosure, this isn't my joke, was sent to me    i knew a bloke who was a massive fan of tractors his whole life.  when he was a kid, he didn't have toy cars or posters of lambos on his bedroom wall, he had toy tractors and trailers and posters of the latest john deeres.  he didn't go on holiday to spain, france or even the lake district. no, his family holidays were centred around the agricultural shows, especially the great yorkshire show and the appleby show.  sometimes, the tractor salesmen would even let him go for a ride on a tractor while they moved them about the ground!  as he grew up, his love for tractors never waned or faded, and was just as strong on his wedding day as when he was a child, to the point, he didn't have wedding cars, but tractors!  on his honeymoon, he and his new wife travelled north to stay at appleby manor hotel and go to the show, telling everyone that they were honeymooning.  one of the salesmen, who'd known him for years, asked if he'd like to drive his new wife around the showground in the newest machine.  obviously, he leapt at the chance! to take control of a tractor? this was a dream come true!  so, he and his wife climbed aboard and he drove a full circuit of the ground, loving every single second.  of course, it couldn't last forever and all too soon, they got back to the salesman. they jumped down and thanked the salesman gratefully. the salesman asked if they'd like a photo with the tractor. of course, they said yes and they stood next to the tractor, he with his hand on the step in front of the big wheel and his wife to the outside.  unknown to anyone, he had forgotten to put the handbrake on and a sudden gust of wind, combined with the slight incline the tractor was on caused it to roll forward.  before anyone realised what was happening, he'd slipped on the grass and the big wheel had run straight over him.  the great north air ambulance service was in attendance and flew him straight to the cumberland infirmary at carlisle. nearly every bone in his body was broken, several of organs were damaged and he had huge internal bleeding.  it took hours of surgery to stabilise his condition, followed by a medically induced coma lasting several weeks and repeated surgical treatments to realign bones and repair what damage they could.  he then was put into an intense physiotherapy regime to teach him to walk and rebuild the strength he had lost over the past six months.  obviously, all this time in the hospital gave him a lot of time to think about his life and he came to the realisation that being such a huge fan of tractors had been a massive waste of time and had, in the end, cost him a lot more than it had ever been worth. he vowed, silently, to leave his obsession behind and move on with a more normal life.  as he laid in his hospital bed, day after day, week after week, month after month, subsisting on the hospital food and whatever his beloved and devoted wife bought to him, he realised that when he got out of there, what he really fancied was a proper pie and a pint in a proper pub.  so when the day came, and he was finally discharged from the loving care of the infirmary, he hurpled on his stick across the road to the pub he'd seen. he got his pint from the bar, ordered a steak and ale pie with creamy mash, peas and gravy and took a seat at a table next to the window.  he was sipping away, soaking up the ambiance and listening to the old man at the end of the bar put the world to rights, when the door to the kitchen flew open and a huge billow of smoke plumed into the bar and filled the room.  everyone was panicking, trying to get out of the pub, but not my mate.  he just calmly stood up, using the table for support and opened the window. he turned his head into the smoke and inhaled deeply, turned back to the window and blew out. he did this twice more and the smoke was gone.  everyone just stopped and looked at him. after a moment the bartender spoke, “how the fuck did you do that???”  “easy,” replied my friend, as he took his seat and picked up his pint, “i'm an ex tractor fan.”	6
a woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, "i played on my college's golf team. i was pretty good. mind if i join you next week?" no one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot… finally, one man says, "okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m."  he figures the early tee-time will discourage her.  the woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.  they roll their eyes, but say, "okay."  she's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.  she's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.  they congratulate her and invite her back the next week.  she smiles, and says, "i'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45."  the next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.  only this time, she plays left-handed.  the three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.  they're totally amazed.  they can't figure her out.  she's very pleasant and a gracious winner.  they invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.  the third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.  this week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.  the men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.  however, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.  this woman is a riddle no one can figure out.  they have a couple of beers in the clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, "how do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?"  the lady blushes, and grins. "when my dad taught me to play golf, i learned that i was ambidextrous." she replies. "i like to switch back and forth."  "when i got married after college, i discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. from then on, i developed a silly habit. right before i leave in the morning for golf practice, i pull the covers off him. if his willie points to the right, i golf right-handed; if it points to the left, i golf left-handed."  the guys think this is hysterical.  astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, "what if it's pointing straight up?"  she says, "then, i'm fifteen minutes late."	7

a father and his young son go to a restaurant and to keep him occupied, he gives the boy three pennies to play with. suddenly, the boy starts choking and his face starts turning blue! the father realizes the boy has swallowed the pennies and starts slapping him on the back...   the boy coughs up two of the pennies, but keeps choking.  looking at his son, panicking, the father starts shouting for help.  a well dressed, serious looking woman, in a blue business suit is sitting at a nearby table reading from her laptop and sipping a cup of coffee.  at the sound of the commotion, she looks up, puts her coffee cup down, gets up from her seat and makes her way, unhurried, across the restaurant.  reaching the boy, the woman carefully drops his pants, takes hold of the boy’s testicles and starts to squeeze and twist, gently at first and then ever so firmly.  after a few seconds the boy convulses violently and coughs up the last penny, which the woman deftly catches in her free hand.  releasing the boy’s testicles, the woman walks back to her seat at the coffee bar without saying a word, but keeps the penny.  as soon as he is sure that his son has suffered no ill effects, the father rushes over to the woman and starts thanking her saying, “i’ve never seen anybody do anything like that before, it was fantastic. are you a doctor?”  “no,” the woman replied. “i’m with the internal revenue service.”	8

a man walking down the street saw an old woman carrying two bags in her hands, one of which was filled with money. he asked her, "where did an old woman like yourself get a bag of money?"  she said, "well, there's a golf course behind my house and when golfers need to take a piss they stick their dicks in a hole in my fence and piss all over my flowerbed. it became a problem, so i sat next to the hole with a pair of shears and every time one of them sticks it in to take a piss, i scream "give me a hundred or i'll cut it clean off".  he said, "uh huh. and what's in the other bag?"  "not all of them pay".	4

[nsfw] a joke my dad told me  (repost with edits (i was the original poster))  a young man wanted to buy a christmas present for his new girlfriend. they hadn't been seeing each other for very long and she lived  far away from him. he consulted with his sister and decided, after careful consideration, that a pair of good quality gloves would strike the right note... not too romantic and not too personal. off he went with his sister to the shops and they selected a dainty pair of fur lined quality leather gloves. his sister bought a pair of sexy knickers for herself at the same time. the shop had a free gift wrap offer but the assistant mixed up the two items, the sister got the gloves and the man unknowingly got the knickers. he sent off his gift wrapped present in a parcel with the following letter.  dear maggie  i chose these because i've noticed that you are not wearing any when we go out in the evenings. if it had not been for my sister i would have chosen the long ones with buttons, but she wears shorter ones (which are easier to remove). these are a very delicate shade, but the lady i bought them from showed me the pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and i hardly noticed any marks. i had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart in them even though they were a little bit tight on her. she also said that they rub against her ring which helps keep it clean. in fact she hasn't needed to wash it since she began wearing them.  i wish i was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt many other hands will touch them before i have a chance to see you again. when you take them off remember to blow into them a little bit because they will be naturally a little damp from wearing. just imagine how many times my lips will kiss them during the coming year. i hope you will wear them for me on our next date. all my love, patrick  p.s. my mum tells me that the latest style is to wear them folded down with a little bit of fur showing.	5

the blondes convention 80,000 blondes meet in a football stadium for a "blondes are not stupid" convention.  the leader says, "we are all here today to prove to the world that blondes are not stupid. can i have a volunteer?"  a blonde gingerly works her way through the crowd and steps up to the stage.  the leader asks her, "what is 15 plus 15?"  after 15 or 20 seconds she says, "eighteen!"  obviously everyone is a little disappointed. then 80,000 blondes start cheering, "give her another chance! give her another chance!"  the leader says, "well since we've gone to the trouble of getting 80,000 of you in one place and we have the world- wide press and global broadcast media here, gee, uh, i guess we can give her another chance."  so he asks, "what is 5 plus 5?"  after nearly 30 seconds she eventually says, "ninety?"  the leader is quite perplexed, looks down and just lets out a dejected sigh -- everyone is disheartened - the blonde starts crying and the 80,000 blondes begin to yell and wave their hands shouting, "give her another chance! give her another chance!"  the leader, unsure whether or not he is doing more harm than good, eventually says, "ok! ok! just one more chance -- what is 2 plus 2?"  the girl closes her eyes, and after a whole minute eventually says, "four?"  throughout the stadium pandemonium breaks out as all 80,000 blondes jump to their feet, wave their arms, stomp their feet and scream... "give her another chance! give her another chance!"	4

i was driving in the desert in my 1989 jeep wrangler. i was going for a drive in the vast, dry deserts of nevada. i had just gotten in a fight with my wife, and yes, i might have had a little too much to drink and a little too poor a sense of direction to be doing what i was doing. cacti and tumbleweeds blurred past me as i tried my best to ignore the clunking sound coming out from under the old wrangler's hood. one stretch of road blended into the next. as the road got bumpier, i realized i wasn't even on a road after all, but rather wandering the desert on an uncharted course.  *slortch!* a sickening crunch sent me and my battered mount spiraling and screeching over the coarse, sandy dunes. sand got everywhere. the jeep rammed into a dune with a *thud* and i blacked out.  *"fool of a crook!"* i heard in a thunderous voice. i looked around, panicked. my legs were caught under some jeep guts that had spilled all over me. i couldn't move. *"are all you humans this stupid, or are you an extra rare shiny specimen?"*  "what?! who's there? what's going on?" was all i could spew from my confused mouth.  *"i am na'thwhqangq'yi, though those of your kind often call me nathaniel. do you not know what you nearly crashed into?"*  still looking around, i shrugged. "a wedding party?" i offered. out of the corner of my eye, a slimy silver snake slithered silently into view.   "ahem. do you see any extravagant mate pairings in the vicinity? you're hardly doing anyone any favors."  staring into his beady little eyes, i was shocked to realize that the voice was coming from the snake! it seemed to be some kind of telepathic ability. not only that, he had lowered his voice now that he was closer.  "well, *nate the snake,*" i quipped, "it's not like you've exactly been handing out favors either! what are you, anyway? some kind of area 51 experiment?"  despite the stupidity of my remarks, i heard something like a muffled chuckle. "nate the snake... i like that. what i am is very old, and beyond your mortal understanding. but i have been imprisoned within this serpentine body for the purpose of guarding the terminus obelisk. it is one spoke of a wheel that, when turned, will ignite ancient flames within this planet that will destroy everything on it. and above it. and outside it, in dimensions you cannot imagine."  "huh... and what are the other spokes of this wheel? what does that metaphor even mean?" i asked.  nate the snake scoffed. "it's literally a wheel, pal. see that stick over there? in the mud?"  i looked over at some kind of branch-looking thing protruding from a mud pit nearby. a stick in the mud.   "i'm not your pal, guy! the name's jesse. so... you're telling me if i had hit that switch over there, the entire universe and beyond would have ended?"  nate nodded sagely. "a stick. a switch. an on/off button for existence, if you will, but more of a lever than a button."  i snapped "i'm not will, i'm jesse! pay attention, geez."  again, that stupid sexy chuckle. "well i'm not geez, either! nate the snake, remember?"  "right. by the way, help a pal out and get my legs free, please? i'm not a badass snake like you. i really need to pee."  the car parts holding me down dimly glowed and were lifted from my legs. i thanked nate heartily and tried to get the jeep started. no luck.  finding i was stuck here, in the middle of the desert, i did what any sane man would do: make conversation with nate the snake. i found out he'd been guarding this obelisk thing for centuries. it really didn't look like an "obelisk" to me, though, so i just started calling it the lever of doom, and it stuck.   when i got thirsty, nate was kind enough to lead me to a nearby spring hidden just under a dune that i would have completely missed otherwise. as i drank greedily from the spring, i talked to nate about my life and my problems.  despite coming off as a bit of a jerk at first blush, nate was actually pretty interested in my life. turns out women in lakes handing out swords is no basis for government, but ancient spirits in snakes handing out advice is an excellent basis for turning your life around. we talked for hours and hours about my wife, jamie, how all the little times i pissed her off had added up, how she rearranged my things only because she loved me and wanted to clean up the place.  days passed as i tried to fix the jeep and failed. no cell reception. i had no idea where the nearest town was. nate the snake took pity on me and helped guide me to some wild berries that kept me fed near that mysterious hidden spring. we talked more - about how i felt i was at a dead end at my job, about the career i wanted to pursue and how my manager seemed so much more selfish than other managers in my division. we talked about his abilities, and he showed me some more of the mystical secrets of the desert. he gave me a killer flan recipe. it was all information that i would later take to improve my life immeasurably.  eventually, i found out what was stopping the wrangler from starting. with a few zaps from nate, the engine roared to life.  "i'm going to miss you, nate the snake. i feel like we really connected these past few weeks."  "and i you," nate replied. "but this needn't be goodbye forever. return to this desert, take a left, then a right, and repeat. when you are wandering, when you are lost, you can find me and we can chat once more. however, you must promise ne that you will never tell anyone about the lever of doom."   i took his blessing and warning to heart. can't believe i even got the old coot to call it the lever of doom, too.  and return to him i did. over the years, as he said, whenever i felt lost in life, i would return to the desert, play the left-right game, and find warm-blooded counsel from nate. he helped me find solace after my first divorce; he held me stable when the market crashed and i felt totally responsible for it; i bought some guns and helped him defend the lever of doom from void-faced legions from hell. nate became my dearest friend in life.  one last day, in my hairs of gray, i took one last drive in the deserts of nevada. i drove my 1989 jeep wrangler, repaired multiple times over the years, like i had many times before. as always, i played the left-right game.  i was glad to see nate's figure in the distance as my jeep approached. old friend, one final visit from me.  *clunk!*   uh oh.  that was not a sound my jeep should have made.  i slammed on the brakes, but nothing happened. the engine roared faster and faster. i was directly on a collision course with the terminus obelisk! that stupid little stick in the mud that could destroy the universe. sweating, i knew i had to make a split second decision... but i knew nathaniel would never forgive me if i didn't do it.  at the last minute, i swerved into my dearest friend, killing him instantly, and yelled,  *better nate than lever!*	7

it’s getting crowded in heaven, so one day saint peter decides to only accept people who make him laugh. a man came walking up to the pearly gates, and saint peter said to him:  “alright bud, you’re only getting in today if you can make me laugh, so why don’t you tell me about how you died.”  the man looked at saint peter and said, “oh man, it was awful! i was absolutely sure my wife was having an affair, so i left work early to come home and try to catch her in the act. when i got home, sure as shit there she was, naked on the bed! i looked all over the apartment, but i couldn’t find the guy anywhere. so i went outside on our 25th story balcony, and there he was!! hanging over the edge by his fingertips! so i ran inside, and grabbed my hammer and ran back outside and started smashing his hands and fingers with it! he finally let go, and he fell down 25 stories but he landed in some bushes, so i ran inside and using all of my might, i grabbed my refrigerator, picked it up, and threw it over the rail and on top of the guy, crushing and killing him!! but all of the strain and exertion from picking up the refrigerator gave me a heart attack and i died.”  saint peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let the poor soul in.   another man came walking up to the pearly gates, and saint peter told this man the same thing—that in order to get in, he was going to have to make saint peter laugh. so the second started to tell saint peter how he died.   “oh man, it was awful! i was doing aerobics out on my 26th story balcony of my apartment, when all of a sudden a flock of birds came out of nowhere and started attacking me! i was trying to get away, but i fell over the edge of my railing! however, on my way down i managed to grab the railing of the apartment below mine...but then this maniac suddenly showed up and started smashing my hands and fingers with a hammer until i let go! fortunately for me, i landed in some bushes, but then some guy dropped a freaking refrigerator on me!  saint peter chuckled again, let the second guy into heaven, and was realizing he has found a way he could really start enjoying his job! about that time, a 3rd man comes walking up to the pearly gates, and saint peter gave him the speech about needing to make him laugh, and asks him how he died.  “oh man, you’re never going to believe this shit! alright, so picture this—i’m butt naked and hiding in a refrigerator...”	8
there was an old man who lived by a forest as he grew older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald. that day, he called his children to a meeting.  he said, “look at my hair. it used to be so magnificent, but it’s completely gone now. my hair can’t be saved. but look outside at the forest. it’s such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they’ll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair.”  “what i want you to do,” the man continued, “is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. tell your descendants to do the same. it shall be our family’s duty to keep this forest strong.”  so they did. each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them. and for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.	8

"hey, have you fellas seen my goat?" "yeah, we just saw him run outta the woods and jump straight into this hole" the old man replies "nah, couldn't have been my goat, my goat was tied to a log"	7

a blonde wants to travel abroad. she parks her car in front of a bank near the airport and gets out with her trolleys. she then enters the bank and walks to the next teller.  blonde: hello, i want to get a loan for $1000,-  teller: very well. but i need a credit security in order to grant you that loan.   blonde: how about my car? it is right in front of the bank entrance.   the teller takes a look through the glass door: very well, this car is valuable enough.   the blonde and the teller exchange keys and loan. after that, the blonde walks off with her trolleys and gets to her airplane.  two weeks later she returns to the bank with her trolleys and sees the teller she had received her loan from 2 weeks ago.   the blonde approaches the teller: hello mister. i have taken a loan of $1000,- from you and i wish to return it today and get my car back.  teller: very well, i accept your payment of $1000,- with an additional $5,- as interest. if you pay off the total of $1005,- , then you will get your car keys back.   the blonde and the teller exchange the money for the car keys. before the blonde walks off, the teller asks her one last question.   teller: excuse my curiosity, but why did you leave your car for security in exchange of that small amount of money?  the blonde smiles back: because nowhere else you can park that close to an airport for just 5 bucks for two weeks.	8

"how are you, tonight," he greeted, "and what can i get started for you?"'  the woman took one look at joe's feet, and immediately slapped her menu down. "no, no, i can't take it. i need a different waiter!"  joe frowned, a bit hurt. "i'm sorry. i-"  still shaking her head, the woman stood up and hurried straight out of the restaurant, leaving joe standing there, looking confused.  the man let out a deep sigh, even as he stood to follow.

" hello ?"   is your daddy home?" he asked  " yes ,"   whispered the small voice.   may i talk with him?"   the child whispered, " no ."     surprised and wanting to talk with an adult, the boss asked, "is your mommy there?" "  yes ."      "may i talk with her?" again the small voice whispered, "  no ."   hoping there was somebody with whom he could leave a message, the boss asked, "is anybody else there?"    " yes ,"   whispered the child, " a policeman ".     wondering what a cop would be doing at his employee's home, the boss asked, "may i speak with the policeman?"    " no, he's busy ", whispered the child.    "busy doing what?"    " talking to daddy and mommy and the fireman ,"  came the whispered answer.    growing more worried as he heard a loud noise in the background through the earpiece on the phone, the boss asked, "what is that noise?"      " a helicopter "  answered the whispering voice.     "what ! is going on there?" demanded the boss, now truly apprehensive.     again, whispering, the child answered, " the search team just landed a helicopter ."      alarmed, concerned and a little frustrated the boss asked, "what are they searching for?"    still whispering, the young voice replied with a muffled giggle...                     " me!."	8

trump has a heart attack and dies. he goes to hell where the devil is waiting for him. "i don't know what to do," says the devil. "you're on my list but i have no room for you. but you definitely have to stay here, so i'll tell you what i'm going to do. i've got three people here who weren't quite as bad as you. i'll let one of them go, but you have to take their place. i'll even let you decide who leaves." trump thought that sounded pretty good so he agreed.  the devil opened the first room. in it was richard nixon and a large pool of water. he kept diving in and surfacing empty handed over and over and over, such was his fate in hell. "no!" trump said. "i don't think so. i'm not a good swimmer and i don't think i could do that all day long."  the devil led him to the next room. in it was tony blair with a sledgehammer and a room full of rocks. all he did was swing that hammer, time after time after time. "no! i've got this problem with my shoulder. i would be in constant agony if all i could do was break rocks all day!" commented trump.   the devil opened a third door. in it, trump saw bill clinton lying naked on the floor with his arms staked over his head and his legs staked in spread-eagle pose. bent over him was monica lewinsky, doing what she does best.  trump looked at this in disbelief for a while and finally said, "yeah, i can handle this."  the devil smiled and said, "monica, you're free to go".......	8

a new guy starts work at a bakery. he's handed his rota and his eyes lighten up: "great, it's dinner-roll day!". the supervisor is puzzled to see such enthusiasm for so mundane a task as baking dinner rolls, but sure enough, the new guy goes to it with zest and panache and is soon turning out dinner rolls the like of which the supervisor has never seen or tasted, imaginatively designed and with a taste and texture beyond all praise or even description.  it's the same again the next day when the new guy comes in and looks at the rota: "wow, wholemeal loaf day!". and sure enough, he puts the same verve and expertise into making wholemeal loaves as he did into dinner rolls the day before, and soon they are selling like something for which there ought to be a suitable simile when you're telling a story about a bakery.  on the wednesday he takes one look at the words "danish pastry day" on the rota and immediately bursts into song, turning out tray after tray of beautifully formed and succulent danish pastries, and on thursday the excited shriek of "doughnut day! yes!!!" heralds an eight-hour shift of doughnuts that god himself would forgive the sins of a whole world for.  but on friday:  "i don't understand it," says the disappointed supervisor to the master baker. "it's his cake day and he's made barely any effort at all."	7

an old joke in china: why doesn’t al-qaeda attack china? because osama bin laden sent 6 terrorists to china, but they all failed:  the first one was sent to plant a bomb at a traffic interchange, but he lost his directions once he got there.  the second one was sent to attack a bus wearing a suicide vest, but he tried for two hours and still couldn’t get on the bus.  the third one was sent to blow up a supermarket but his remote control was stolen as soon as he got inside.   the fourth one tried to attack a skyscraper, but before he was able to enter, the security guard beat him up, yelling “i told you guys to stop asking for your wages!” (note: lots of contract workers at construction sites don’t get paid properly, so they keep visiting their boss, demanding to get paid)  the fifth one actually managed to blow up a coal mine, killing hundreds of workers. but when he reported back, bin laden thought he was lying and killed him because the attack could not be found anywhere in chinese news reports.  the sixth one was a woman. but before she was able to do anything, she got kidnapped by human traffickers and was sold to a rural village; no one ever heard back about her again.   (not part of this joke but something i really want to say: china gets mentioned a lot in reddit, both on the front page and in this sub; but most of the time people in the comments section are just repeating the same things over and over again, and making jokes that are neither creative or accurate, so i thought i’d just post things to show how jokes are actually done in china. stuff like this was very popular over chinese internet a few years ago, before xi became president.)	6

"the diet you are providing is working wonders. it is different from before but can't say what it is?"  the cook calmly states "fuhrer as a matter of fact it is. you see i have studied under the best of teachers, taken feedback from your associates and done my best to gradually introduce you to this change in philosophy"  hitler asks "philosophy? and what is this philosophy?"  the chef clears his throat and states "in order to lead a healthy and prosperous life one must learn to accept the peas and embrace the juice"	6

a cowboy had spent many days crossing the montana prairies without water. his horse had already died of thirst. he's crawling along the dusty ground, certain that he has breathed his last breath, when all of a sudden he sees an object sticking out of the ground several yards ahead of him.   he crawls to the object, pulls it out of the ground and discovers what looks to be an old briefcase. he opens it and out pops a genie.   but this is no ordinary genie. she is wearing an irs id badge and a dull grey dress. there's a calculator in her pocketbook.  she has a pencil tucked behind one ear. 'well, cowboy,' says the genie, 'you know how i work....you have three wishes.'   'i'm not falling for this,' said the cowboy, 'i'm not going to trust an irs genie.'   'what do you have to lose? you've got no transportation, and it looks like you're a goner anyway!'   the cowboy thinks about this for a minute and decides that the genie is right.   'ok! i wish i were along-side a lush spring with plenty of food and drink.'   --poof-- the cowboy finds himself beside the most beautiful spring he has ever seen, and he's surrounded with jugs of wine and platters of delicacies.   'ok, cowpoke, what's your second wish.'  'my second wish is that i was rich...beyond my wildest dreams.'   --poof-- the cowboy finds himself surrounded by treasure chests filled with rare gold coins and precious gems.   'ok, cowpuncher, you have just one more wish.  better make it a good one!'   after thinking for a few minutes, the cowboy says, 'i wish that no matter where i go, beautiful women will want and need me.'   -- poof -- he was turned into a tampon.   moral of the story:  if the u.s. government offers to help you, there's going to be a string attached.	2

several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to convert to catholicism or leave italy. there was a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he'd have a religious debate with the leader of the jewish community...   if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.  the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.  however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.  on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other.  the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.  the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.  next, the pope waved his finger around his head.  the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.  the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.  the rabbi pulled out an apple.  with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever.  the jews could stay in italy!  later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened.  the pope said, "first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs. then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us. finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin. he bested me at every move and i could not continue!"  meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won.  "i don't have a clue!!!" the rabbi said.  "first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger. then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here."  "and then what?" asked a woman.  "who knows!!" said the rabbi. "he took out his lunch, so i took out mine!"	8

john and the cab driver one cold, winter evening john finished his office job in london victoria and went straight to the pub. he had few drinks too many that night and decided to take a cab home, but when he looked in his wallet he only had last £20 inside. he approached a black cab outside the pub and asked how much would it cost him to go to kings cross and the cabbie replied £25. after asking if he could possibly take him for £20 the cab driver declined and told him to get a buss. john was desperate for that cab so he asked again and again but without any luck, the cab driver just wouldn’t change his mind. so having no choice john had to take a bus home. the next morning he woke up with a sore head and it was time to go back to work. when he left his apartment and was walking past kings cross station he passed a long line of black taxis and on the end of that line was the cabbie from last night. john went back to the first taxi and asked the driver how much was it to victoria, he replied £25. john said “ i’ll give you £50 if you suck me off on our way” the cabbies response was “fuck off you pervert”. then john approached the second cab in line and popped the same question and pretty much got the same response. he carried on from cab to cab asking the same question and getting the same answer until he finally got to the last cab, the one from previous night in victoria. he asked the driver “how much is it to victoria?” he responded “it’s £25 mate”, then john said “ i tell you what, i’ll give you £50 if you drive off slowly and we both wave to all of your cabdriver friends”	6

upon hearing that her elderly grandfather had just passed away, katie went straight to her grandparent's house to visit her 95 year-old grandmother and comfort her. when she asked how her grandfather had died, her grandmother replied, "he had a heart attack while we were making love on sunday morning." horrified, katie told her grandmother that 2 people nearly 100 years old having sex would surely be asking for trouble. "oh no, my dear," replied granny. "many years ago, realizing our advanced age, we figured out the best time to do it was when the church bells would start to ring. it was just the right rhythm. nice and slow and even. nothing too strenuous, simply in on the ding and out on the dong." she paused to wipe away a tear, and continued, "he'd still be alive if the ice cream truck hadn't come along."  fair warning, this is a repost, not oc	2

two men are shipwrecked on an island... (long) they decide to explore the island to look for food as they are quite hungry. after a while of searching they find a cabin hidden in the middle of the woods and there's smoke coming from the chimney.  the first man tells the second he'll go knock and check it out and that the other should stay outside in case he doesn't come back out then at least one of them can escape.  so he goes up to the door and knocks and the other man hides in the bushes. an old and hairy looking woman answers the door. he says " excuse me miss but myself and a few others washed up on this beach and we're quite hungry, would you happen to have some food to spare?"   she beckoned him inside "of course dear, come on in." once inside he sees a table brimming with food and his stomach rumbles. the old woman turns to him and says " it's been such a very long time since i've seen a man, make love to me and i'll give you all the food you could possibly want."  the man thinks about it, the woman is very old and hairy and does not smell pleasant... but looking around the room he spies a plate of fresh boiled corn cobs, so he tells the woman " you have yourself a deal, but you must close your eyes for i'm quite shy."  so she closes her eyes and the man grabs a piece of corn off the table. he makes love to her with the piece of corn until she's satisfied and throws it out the window. she brings him a plate of sandwiches and he's about to leave when she stops him.  "you know it's been so long i could go for a second round, how would you like some drinks to go with those sandwiches?" so the man says why not, again she closes her eyes, he makes love to her with the corn, and throws it out the window.  he finally emerges from the house with the plate of sandwiches and cups of drinks and yells out to his friend. " hey, i'm okay! i've got sandwiches and even drinks to go with it! "  his friend says back " forget the sandwiches did you bring anymore of that hot buttered corn?"	4

my girlfriend and i had been dating for over a year... ...and so we decided to get married. my parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? she was a dream! there was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. my prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. she would regularly bend down when near me and i got many a pleasant view of her underwear. it had to be deliberate. she never did it when she was near anyone else.   one day her little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. she was alone when i arrived. she whispered to me that soon i was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. she told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before i got married and committed my life to her sister. i was in total shock and couldn't say a word. she said, "i'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me." i was stunned. i was frozen in shock as i watched her go up the stairs. when she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. i stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. i opened the door and stepped out of the house. i walked straight towards my car. my future father-in-law was standing outside. with tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, "we are very happy that you have passed our little test. we couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. welcome to the family".  the moral of this story is:  always keep your condoms in your car.	7

"that's simple," she said. "by the nail that's over its stall," she explains very confidently.  laughing rudely at her, the man says, "and what, pray tell, is the  nail for?" the blonde turns to walk away and says sweetly over her  shoulder, “i guess it’s to hang your pants on,” she replied.	7

a cowboy rode into town and stopped at a saloon for a drink. unfortunately, the locals always had a habit of picking on strangers, which he was. when he finished his drink, he found his horse had been stolen. he went back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air, caught it above his head without even looking and fired a shot into the ceiling.    "which one of you sidewinders stole my horse?!" he yelled with surprising forcefulness. no one answered.    "alright, i'm gonna have another beer, and if my horse ain't back outside by the time i finish, i'm gonna do what i dun in texas! and i don't like to have to do what i dun in texas!"   some of the locals shifted restlessly.  the man, true to his word, had another beer, walked outside, and his horse has been returned to the post.  he saddled up and started to ride out of town. the bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, "say partner, before you go... what happened in texas?" the cowboy turned back and said, "i had to walk home."	8

this was a joke that i was told last year by my tour guide in berlin about cold war-era russia. every morning, general secretary leonid brezhnev would go out onto his balcony and stretch. he would look up at the sun, rising in the east and go, “good morning, sun. it is a beautiful day outside.”  the sun would reply, “good morning, general secretary! thank you for admiring my work!”  during lunch, brezhnev would walk back out onto his balcony and look up, seeing the sun directly overhead, and say, “good afternoon, sun. thank you for making such a lovely day!”  the sun would always reply, “good afternoon, general secretary! and you are very welcome for the weather.”  as the sun began to set, brezhnev would walk onto his balcony again, stretching before going to bed, and say, “good night, sun. thank you for the beautiful day you gave me.”  the sun would reply, “fuck you, old man! i’m in the west now, and can say whatever the hell i want!”	6

the joke my great-grandpa told me about 15 years ago a man kisses his wife goodnight and goes to sleep one day. after he wakes up, he notices an old man in white robes lying next to him instead of his wife.   - who are you and why are you in my bed?! - he asks.   - this is not your bedroom. i am st peter and you're in heaven.   - what?! i'm dead? it can't be! bring me back to earth, now!   - it's not that easy. you can either come back as a chicken, or a dog.   the man thinks about it and figures that a chicken's life is more calm then dog's life.   - bring me back as a dog. - exclaims the man.      suddenly, the man appears as a chicken on a farm. another chicken approaches him and says:   - you must be the new chicken that st peter told me about.   - oh yes that's me.   - so, how do you like being a chicken?   - well, i feel like my rump is going to explode!   the other chicken shrugs with his wings and says:   - you got to lay an egg to get some relief.   - and how am i supposed to do that?!   - cackle two times and then push as hard as you can.      the man-chicken cackles and pushes as hard as he can.   - wow, that was great! i want to lay some more eggs!   and he pushes, and lays another one, and another. suddenly, he hears his wife screaming:   - john, wake up! you have shat all over the bed!	2

bubba joe is a down to earth farm boy from east texas and falls in love with a girl after some time, they decide to get married, but before that can happen his fiance tells him that he must become christian. now bubba joe was never really religious but he really loves this girl and heads off to the local catholic church and asks the priest if he can become a parishioner. the priest welcomes him but says in order to join the church he must tell him where jesus was born. now bubba joe had never really travelled much and had never even gotten outside of texas. after thinking a bit, he replies "was it dallas?", at which the priest is aghast but gathers himself and says, "bubba joe i'm sorry but our parishioners must be knowledgeable about jesus' life, why don't you try the methodist church down the street?" determined not to let his fiance down, bubba joe goes there and the priest there asks him the same question. bubba joe recalled jesus being from a small town and replies," father, was it tyler?" the methodist priest is also taken aback but composes himself and says, "i'm sorry bubba joe but why don't you try the baptist church, they take everyone in as long you believe in god." feeling defeated a little, but glad that he now has a solution, he heads to the baptist church where the pastor there asks him, "bubba joe do you believe in god?" to which he responds, "yes father, i do," and the pastor responds with, "well then you will be attain salvation by the grace of god!"   glad that he has now fulfilled his fiance's request but still confused as to where jesus was from, bubba joe asks the pastor the question to which he responds, "oh that's easy, jesus was born in palestine." bubba joe slaps his knee and says "i knew jesus was born in east texas!"	1

on the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence. one day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. "one for you, one for me, one for you, one for me," said one boy. several dropped and rolled down toward the fence. another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. as he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. he slowed down to investigate. sure enough, he heard, "one for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ...."  he just knew what it was. he jumped back on his bike and rode off. just around the bend, he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along.  "come here quick," said the boy, "you won't believe what i heard! satan and the lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!"  the man said, "beat it, kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk." when the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery.  standing by the fence they heard, "one for you, one for me. one for you, one for me."  the old man whispered, "boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. let's see if we can see the lord...?" shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. the old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the lord.  at last, they heard, "one for you, one for me. that's all. now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done...."  they say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him.	7

so a politician dies... and ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. saint peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.  ‟so, you’re a politician...” ‟well, yes, is that a problem?” ‟oh no, no problem. but we have recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in hell. after that however, you’re free to choose where you want to spend eternity!”   ‟wait, i have to spend a day in hell??” says the politician. ‟them’s the rules” says st peter, clicks his fingers, and woomph, the guy dissapears...  and awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he’s in hell. cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... nothing. just the smell of, is that fabric softener? and cut grass, this can’t eb right?  ‟open your eyes!” says a voice. ‟c’mon, wakey wakey, we have only got 24 hours!”. nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he’s in a hotel room. a nice one too. wait, this is a penthouse suite... and there’s a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ‟who are you??” the politician asks. ‟well, i’m satan!” says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ‟welcome to hell!” ‟wait, this is hell? but... where’s all the pain and suffering?” he asks. satan throws him a wink. ‟oh, we have been a bit mis-represented over the years, it’s a long story. anyway, this is your room! the minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there’s extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. but enough of this! it’s a beautiful day, and if you’d care to look outside...” slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ‟it’s one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there’s another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!” says satan, answering his unasked question. so they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. and as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he’s admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he’s admired but died long before his career started. and out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. he spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the tme of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with marylin monroe). as everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... and they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. after 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep...  and is woken up  by st peter. ‟so, that was hell. wasn’t what you were expecting, i bet?” ‟no sir!” says the man. ‟so then” says st peter ‟you can make your choice. it’s hell, which you saw, or heaven, which has choral singing, talking to god, white robes, and so on”. ‟well... i know this sounds strange, but on balance, i think i would prefer hell” says the politician. ‟not a problem, we totally understand! enjoy!” says st peter, and clicks his fingers again.  the man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. as he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. a sudden bolt of lightning reveals satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. ‟what’s this??” he cries. ‟where’s the hotel?? where’s my wife??? where’s the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???”  ‟ah”, says satan. ‟you see, yesterday, we were campaigning. but today, you voted...”	8

hey, it happens as you get older nsfw  30 years ago i saw a sideshow that touted, "harold, the magnificent jew"  intrigued i paid the entrance fee and had a seat in a packed tent with about 50 others.  in the back of the tent was a table on a small stage. the sideshow barker came out with a large fellow in just a bathrobe he introduced as harold the magnificent jew!  the barker then placed 3 whole walnuts spaced out across the table. as a drum roll began off stage the big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, whack, whack, whack shattering each walnut with his penis. the crowd goes wild with applause.  fast forward 30 yrs and i happen to find myself in that same part of town. sure enough that sideshow tent was still there with the same banner advertising  "harold, the magnificent jew". i think to myself this can't be the same guy. so curiosity gets the best of me & i again pay the entrance fee.  sure enough the stage barker intros the big fellow, now grey and a little hunched over as harold, the magnificent jew. only this time the barker sets up 3 coconuts across the table.   again the big fellow steps up to the table, opens his bath robe and takes his enormous manhood and goes, whack, whack, whack shattering each coconut with his penis. the crowd goes wild with applause.  before i leave i happen to catch harold and tell him i first saw his performance 30yrs ago. but that he crushed walnuts back then. so i asked him, what's with him using coconuts now?  with a heavy sigh he confided to me, "vell, i have to tell you young man. one day you may have this happen to you too. so if you please don't think too harshly of me.  my apologies but you just have to understand after 30 yrs:   my eyesight just isn't as good as it used to be!	4

box under the bed when eamonn and ruth first got married eamonn said, *“i am a sex addict and i’m putting a box under the bed to help control my addiction. you must promise never to look in it.”*  in all their 30 years of marriage, ruth never looked. however, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. in the box were 3 empty beer cans and £81,874.25 in cash. she closed the box and put it back under the bed. now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there even was such a box with such contents.  that evening they were out for a special anniversary dinner. after dinner, ruth could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, *“i am so sorry. for all these years i kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. however, today the temptation was too much and i gave in. but now i need to know why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?”* …  eamonn thought for a while and said, *“i guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. whenever i was unfaithful to you i put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.”*  ruth was shocked, but said, *“hmmm,  fiona phillips, penny smith and holly willoughby. i am very disappointed and saddened by your behaviour. however, since you are addicted to sex, i guess it does happen and i guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.”*  eamonn thanked her for being so understanding. they hugged and made their peace.  a little while later ruth asked *"eamonn, so why do you have all that money in the box?"*  eamonn answered; *“well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, i took them to the recycling centre and redeemed them for cash”*	7

an atheist dies and goes to hell the devil welcomes him and says:"let me show you around a little bit." they walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace. "this is your house now, here are your keys." the man is happy and thanks the devil. the devil says:"no need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!"  they continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. "these are your cars now!" and hands the man all the car keys. again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says "everyone down here gets some cool cars! how would you drive around without having cars?".  they walk on and the area gets even nicer. there are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. they arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. she looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. the man couldn´t be any happier. the devil says "everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!"  as they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. he peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. there are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. a stench of sulfur is in the air.  terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil "what is going on there?" the devil just shrugs and says: "those are the christians, i don´t know why, but they prefer it that way".	6

an american went to ireland to play golf... so anyway, the american went down to the local club in killarney and asked around for a playing partner. “i’d be fairly good now so i’d need someone with experience”. “ah, micilín is your man” he was told. so he agreed with micilín to play him for a few quid the next morning at 9. however, micilín did say he might be half an hour late.  so micilín turns up at 9 on the dot with a left handed set of clubs, and beats the american fairly convincingly. the american goes to him “i’ll have to have you again tomorrow”. micilín says “that’s no bother, but again i could be half an hour late.”  so the next day micilín shows up again at 9, but this time with a right handed set of clubs. the american thinks to himself, surely i’ll win this time, but again micilín outplays him a second time. so the american, frustrated now, says “ i’ll have to play you once more”. micilín replies once again “no bother, but i might be half an hour late.” the american, bewildered, goes “i have to ask, how do you decide whether you’ll play right handed or left handed?”. “well”, micilín replies,”in the morning i look at the wife. if she’s on her left side i play left handed, and if she’s on her right side i play right handed”  “what do you do if she’s on her back?”, the american asks.  “well, i’ll be half an hour late.”	6

"that's better, but it's still not very nice to say the word bathroom at the dinner table. and you, little johnny, can you use your brain for once and show us your good manners?"   johnny said: "i would say: darling, may i please be excused for a moment? i have to shake hands with a very dear friend of mine, who i hope to introduce you to after dinner."	8

[long]so, a pianist walks into his local jazz bar... as he's been down on his luck and is looking for work. he asks one of the waitresses there to speak to the manager, who he approaches and asks,   "are you the dumb fucker that runs this shit hole of a bar?"   the manager, taken very much aback, responds, "excuse me? i am the manager, yes, can you please stop swearing in front of my patrons?"  "good! 'cause i need some fucking work and i'm half decent on the keys!"   and he sits down and begins to play the sweetest, grooviest, bluest-of-blues tracks the bar manager has ever heard.   "d..did you write that? that was beautiful! what's it called?"   "that i did! it's called, why don't you go fuck the ass off of a low flying duck you insolent cunt?"   aghast, the manager gestures for the pianist to hush, and quietly asks "do you know any jazz? anything a little more intricate?"   "'course i do!"   and again the pianist plays the most delightful and devilish jazz piece the manager has heard.   bracing for the name of this track, he asks "well what do you call it?"   "i'll fuck your mother's hairy minge under the cover of pale moonlight!"   appalled, though aware of the man's talents, the manager offers him a spot on the bill, on the proviso that he doesn't name his songs after he plays them, and the pianist happily agrees.   *later that evening...*   about 5 from showtime, the pianist has set himself up on stage and is perusing the crowd, gauging the energy of the room, when he suddenly spies the most beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous woman he's ever seen - tight fitting red dress with red lipstick to match, high heels - you name it. after slight deliberation, and with the 5 minutes to spare, the pianist decides it a good idea to go try rub one out in the men's room, to "deal with the stress of performing", as he justifies it.   well, lo and behold it takes a little longer than 5 minutes, and the manager comes bursting into the bathroom (on the other side of the stall, mind you), and yells  "christ mate, where have you been?! the people are getting agitated - you've a show to play! don't you fuck this up for me!"  before leaving the bathroom abrutply.   the pianist rages on with the task at hand, and after wrapping up he bursts from the bathroom back onto the stage and sets right to playing.   after his first song, the lovely woman he had spied earlier approaches him from the side of the stage, leans into his ear and whispers   "excuse me, do you know your dick is hanging out of your pants and there's cum dribbling onto your shoe?"  stunned, the pianist turns to her and says   "know it?! i wrote that fucking song!"	5

at the command it was opening night at the orpheum and the amazing claude was topping the bill. people came from miles around to see the famed hypnotist do his stuff. as claude took to the stage, he announced,  "*unlike most stage hypnotists who invite two or three people up onto the stage to be put into a trance, i intend to hypnotize each and every member of the audience.*"  the excitement was almost electric as claude withdrew a beautiful antique pocket watch from his coat.   "*i want you each to keep your eye on this antique watch. it's a very special watch. its been in my family for six generations.*"  he began to swing the watch gently back and forth while quietly chanting,   "*watch the watch, watch the watch, watch the watch....*"  the crowd became mesmerized as the watch swayed back and forth, light gleaming off its polished surface. hundreds of pairs of eyes followed the swaying watch, until suddenly it slipped from the hypnotist's fingers and fell to the floor, breaking into a hundred pieces.  "*shit!!!*" said the hypnotist.  it took three weeks to clean up the theater.	6

the family history of jack schitt we find ourselves at a loss when someone says, "you don't know jack schitt!" so, i just researched about his family history for y'all.  jack schitt is the only son of awe schitt.  awe schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married miss o. needeep they had one son, jack.  in turn, jack schitt married noe schitt. the deeply religious couple produced six children: holie schitt, giva schitt, fulla schitt, bull schitt, and the twins deap schitt and dip schitt.  against her parents' objections, deap schitt married her cousin dumb schitt, a high school dropout. after being married 15 years, jack and noe schitt divorced.  noe schitt later married ted sherlock, and, because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. she was then known as noe schitt sherlock.  meanwhile, dip schitt married loda schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition named chick n. schitt.  two of the other six children, fulla schitt and giva schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the happens brothers in a dual ceremony.  the wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the schitt-happens nuptials.  the schitt-happens children were dawg, byrd, and hoarse. bull schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. he recently returned from italy with his new italian bride, pisa schitt.	5

please enjoy my best ever star wars themed joke... irving was proud of his daughter faith. she was the prettiest, smartest, most charming girl in all the empire. and when faith was asked to attend the winter gala by conan antonio, irving was justifiably pleased, for conan was a well-decorated and many-times-promoted military man of great respect.  on the night of the gala, however, conan stood faith up, and a horrified irving approached conan’s overseer, darth. irving wanted darth to know what a disreputable man conan actually was. darth, concerned, went to the gala with irving, where they both found conan dancing with some other girl. irving was seething, and he turned to darth and demanded: is there nothing you can do?  darth reached out and grabbed conan antonio by the throat, choking the life out of him, and intoned harshly:   “i find your lack of faith dissed irving!”	1

an engineer, a psychologist, and a theologian were hunting in the wilderness of northern canada. an engineer, a psychologist, and a theologian were hunting in the wilderness of northern canada.  suddenly, the temperature dropped and a furious snowstorm was upon them. they came across an isolated cabin, far removed from any town. the hunters had heard that the locals in the area were quite hospitable, so they knocked on the door to ask permission to rest.   no one answered their knocks, but they discovered the cabin was unlocked and they entered. it was a simple place ... 2 rooms with a minimum of furniture and household equipment. nothing was unusual about the cabin except the stove. it was large, potbellied, and made of cast-iron. what was strange about it was its location ... it was suspended in midair by wires attached to the ceiling beams.   "fascinating," said the psychologist. "it is obvious that this lonely trapper, isolated from humanity, has elevated this stove so that he can curl up under it and vicariously experience a return to the womb."   "nonsense!" replied the engineer. "the man is practicing the laws of thermodynamics. by elevating his stove, he has discovered a way to distribute heat more evenly throughout the cabin."   "with all due respect," interrupted the theologian, "i'm sure that hanging his stove from the ceiling has religious meaning. fire lifted up has been a religious symbol for centuries." the three debated the point for several hours without resolving the issue.   when the trapper finally returned, they immediately asked him why he had hung his heavy potbellied stove from the ceiling. his answer was succinct. "had plenty of wire, not much stove pipe."	5

"i should be in charge," said the legs, "without me the body couldn't go anywhere."  "i should be in charge," said the eyes, "i allow the body to see where it goes."   "i should be in charge," said the anus, "i am responsible for waste removal."  all of the other body parts laughed at the anus and insulted him, so he decided to go on strike.  within a few days, the brain had a terrible headache, the stomach was bloated, the legs got wobbly, the eyes got watery, and the heart pumped toxic blood. they all decided that the anus should be the boss.  what is the moral of the story? even though everybody else does all of the work, the asshole is usually in charge.	8

"you bloody fool!" he cried, "you have ruined me!"  the actor was bewildered, "what happened, did i forget my line?"  "no!" screamed the director. "you forgot the rose!"	5

a lady about 8 months pregnant got on a bus. she noticed the man opposite her was smiling at her. she immediately moved to another seat. this time the smile turned into a grin, so she moved again. the man seemed more amused. when on the fourth move, she had the man arrested.  the case came up in court. the judge asked the man (about 20 years old) what he had to say for himself.   the man replied, " well your honour, it was like this. when the lady got on the bus, i couldn't help noticing her condition. she sat under a sweets sign that said, "the double mint twins are coming" and i grinned.   then she moved and sat under a sign that said, " logan 's liniment will reduce the swelling", and i had to smile.   then she placed herself under a deodorant sign that said, "william's big stick did the trick", and i could hardly contain myself.   but, your honour, when she moved the fourth time and sat under a sign that said, "goodyear rubber could have prevented this accident"...i just lost it."  case dismissed!	3

after many years of hard work, joe rewarded himself with a long, luxurious stay at an exclusive carribean resort. while relaxing on the beach, he was surprised to see a former high school classmate who he hadn't seen since they graduated. his old friend had been something of a "burnout" in high school, and this was the last place joe expected to see him.   joe approached the man, and seized his hand. "pete, it's joe. from high school. it's sure been a long time. you look great! you must really be doing okay for yourself."  "i am," whispered pete. "i am a partner with a very successful law firm. but don't tell mother. she got the idea that i was a drug dealer back when i was in high school, and she would be terribly disappointed if she figured out how i really make my money."	1

a man walked into a bar on the 100th floor of a building, chugged a pint, then jumped out of an open window. ten minutes later, with no injuries, he ran back into the bar, chugged a pint, then jumped out of the same window.  when he returned ten minutes later, a man asked him how he survived.  “you see, alcohol makes you warmer and heat rises. so if you chug a pint really quickly then concentrate really hard as you fall, you temporarily float just before you hit the ground.”  the man was so amazed that he too chugged a pint even faster than the other man, then jumped out of the window. he fell and fell and fell... and then landed on the ground with a splat. he died instantly.  the bartender then turned to the man in the bar and said, “you’re such a dick when you’re drunk, superman.”	8
taxis are foolproof! a couple of nights ago, i was out for drinks with a few friends. had a couple beers and topped it off with shots of tequila. not a good idea.   knowing fully well that i was over the acceptable limit, i did something i never did before: i took a taxi home.  surely enough, i passed a police block, but since it was a taxi they let me through without any problems.  i arrived home safely without incident, which was a real surprise to me the next morning.  i had never driven a taxi before.	3

a guy suffering from banging headaches, finally gets to see a specialist after baffling doctors for years. he explains to the specialist that for years now he has been suffering from banging headaches, and everything he has tried so far has no impact on the headaches at all.  the specialist carries out an examination, pokes and prods around a bit and has an idea. he runs a couple tests to be sure, but is confident he has found the answer to his patients problems  the specialist explains that the issue is that his balls are pushing up against the base of his spine, and as a result is causing these severe headaches. he recommends that they get removed in order to receive the pressure, and hopefully this will cure the headaches.  after careful consideration, the guy decides to have his balls removed, he just can't cope with the headaches any longer.  the operation was a resounding success, and the guys headaches have been cured. he decides to treat himself to a nice new suit so he can make the most of his new lease of life, and enjoy going out again and looking and feeling great. he goes to visit his local taylor's.  he walks in and explains what he wants, and the taylor looks him up and down, rubs his chin and says, "16" collar regular for your shirt" ... "32" waist 34" leg for the trousers" ... "40" chest for the jacket"  the guy is stunned, every measurement was spot on, and not a tape measure in sight. very impressed he tells the taylor "amazing, how did you know all that just looking at me?"  the taylor smiles and explains he has been doing the job all his life, and then asks "we have some excellent new underwear in right now, the most comfortable you will have ever worn in your life, would you like a couple pairs?" the guy agrees, i mean why not, he deserves it. "ok so 32" medium then" says the taylor and he turns away to go and get everything he needs for the sale. as he is walking away the guy says "aha! wrong! im a 32" small" thinking he has got one over on this experienced taylor.   the taylor turns back and says " no no sir, if you wore a 32" small, then your underwear would push your balls up against the base of your spine and cause these banging headaches, i'll get you a 32" medium"	5

old mary and frank have been having some matrimonial issues... no matter how hard he tries, frank just can't bring mary to orgasm anymore.   they decide to visit the doctor for help, because they love each other, in all the ways, and this lack of intimacy is bringing them both down emotionally.   thankfully the doctor has the answer. he advises frank to get a strapping young buck of a man to come over one evening and assist in the love making. all this young man needs to do is stand by the side of the bed as frank and mary get down to business, and wave a bathroom towel over them. guaranteed orgasm from mary the doctor promises.   so the next night frank nervously asks one of his young attractive male work colleagues for a favour.   'hey greg, can you come over and watch me and my wife have sex? you don't have to get involved, just wave a towel over us as we get jiggy. then you can go home. i'll give you $200'  greg agrees. 200 dollars is 200 dollars. he arrives at frank's house that evening and as the lovemaking commences he gently wafts a towel over the copulating geriatrics.   no dice though. mary still can't orgasm. dejected, frank and mary visit the doctor again the next day.   'it didn't make a difference doc... i was doing all my best tricks and we had greg there waving the towel over us but still my poor mary can't orgasm'.  the doctor thinks for a second then replies 'ok.. we can try one more thing. get greg over again tonight. but this time, have greg make love to mary while you stand at the side of the bed and wave the bathroom towel over them. see how that goes'.   and so it was done. mary lays back in bed, greg agrees to come over again, $200 is $200 after all, gets into bed with mary and starts to make love to her while frank stands at the side of the bed waving the towel over them with all he's got   well. mary had orgasm after orgasm. she couldn't stop herself. she was going all night long and has the best 8 hours of her life.   completely spent, mary flops back onto her pillow with the biggest grin on her face that frank has ever seen. mission accomplished.   'you see!?!?' says frank to greg 'that's how you wave a bloody towel!'	3

in sweden we have what is called bellman jokes disclaimer:  carl michael bellman was a swedish author, singer, composer etc. for no  particular reason swedes tell jokes about him. usually involving him  and two other guys from different nationalities. bellman usually wins  out in the end somehow.  on to the joke  there  was once a german, a norwegian and then bellman. they would spend the  night in a hotel. unfortunately all the rooms were occupied but they  were allowed to sleep in the attic if they wanted. the hotel owner told  them that there were ghosts there, but since they were not afraid of  ghosts, they decided to accept the proposal. the german got up first.  when he was up in the attic, he heard a voice saying:  \\- i'm the ghost with the red eyes.  then the german got scared and jumped out the window. the norwegian was the one who then got up. he heard the same voice.  \\- i'm the ghost with the red eyes.  he got so scared that he ran straight through the wall. so it was bellman's turn to go up to the attic.  \\- i'm the ghost with the red eyes, the voice whispered.  \\- well, said bellman, and i'm bellman with the red-spotted underwear.	2

my first condom i was 14 the first time i went to the  neighborhood drugstore to buy a pack of condoms. in those days it took a  lot of guts to walk into the drug store and ask for condoms because  everyone knew everyone else.  mary, the girl behind the counter,  was almost 20 and knew what they were for. she could see that i was  really embarrassed because i turned red and started stuttering.  when mary handed me the package and asked if i knew how to wear one, i said ‘no, not really.'  so she unwrapped the package, took one out, and slipped it over her  thumb. she cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure.  mary could tell that i was still confused, so she looked all around the  store to see if there were any other customers. then she said 'just a  minute,' and walked me into the storage room. then mary took off her  blouse and bra and said ‘do these excite you?'  well, i was so  dumb-struck that all i could do was stand there with my mouth open and  nod my head. mary told me to put the condom on, and then she dropped her  skirt, took off her panties and laid down on a desk.  'well, come  on', mary said, 'we don't have much time.' so i climbed on her and it  felt so incredible that i couldn’t hold back and kapow, i was done in  less than a minute.  mary looked at me with a big frown and said,  'did you put that condom on?' she asked. i said, 'sure did,' and held up  my thumb to show her.  then she beat the shit out of me....  women have always been hard for me to figure out.	6

another lawyer joke a very successful attorney parked his brand-new bentley in front of his office, ready to show it off to his colleagues. as he was getting out, a truck came along too closely and completely tore off the driver's door.  fortunately, a cop in a police car was close enough to see the accident and pulled up behind the bentley with his lights flashing.  before the cop had a chance to ask any questions, the attorney started screaming hysterically about how his bentley, which he had just purchased the day before, was completely ruined and would never be the same, no matter how any car body shop tried to make it new again.  after the lawyer finally wound down from his rant, the cop shook his head in disbelief. "i can't believe how materialistic you lawyers are," he said. "you are so focused on your possessions that you neglect the most important things in life."  "how can you say such a thing?" asked the lawyer  the cop replied, "don't you even realize that your left arm is missing? it was severed when the truck hit you!"  "oh, my god!!!"screamed the lawyer.  "my rolex!"	7

"excuse me, general," she asks quietly,  "but could i ask you what magic words you used on that little boy?"      the old man smiles serenely and gently confides, "i showed him my  pilot's wings, service stars, and battle ribbons, and explained that  they entitle me to throw one passenger out the plane door on any flight i choose.	6

bud the cowboy a cowboy named bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in montana when suddenly a brand-new 2019 audi advanced towards him out of a cloud of dust. the driver, a young man named cliff in a brioni® suit, gucci® shoes, rayban® sunglasses and ysl® tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, "if i tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?"     bud looks at the man, who obviously knows more than the cowboy, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, "sure, why not?"      the yuppie parks his car, whips out his dell® notebook computer, connects it to his apple iphone, and surfs to a nasa page on the internet, where he calls up a gps satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another nasa satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo.      the young man then opens the digital photo in adobe photoshop® and exports it to an image processing facility in hamburg, germany     within seconds, he receives an email on his apple ipad® that the image has been processed and the data stored. he then accesses an ms-sql® database through an odbc connected excel® spreadsheet with email on his galaxy s5® and, after a few minutes, receives a response.    finally, he prints out a full-color,15 page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized hp laserjet® printer, turns to the cowboy and says, "you have exactly 1,586 cows and calves."      "that's right. well, i guess you can take one of my calves," says bud.  he watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car. then bud says to the young man, "hey, if i can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?"        the young man thinks about it for a second and then says, "okay, why not?"    "you're a congressman for the u.s.government," says bud.     "wow! that's correct," says the yuppie, “but how did you guess that?"      "no guessing required." answered the cowboy.  "you showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer i already knew, to a question i never asked. you used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know  how working people make a living –you know nothing about cows, for that matter. this is a herd of sheep.”     “now give me back my dog”	6

once upon a time in a kingdom once upon a time in a kingdom, there lived a queen who was a tramp(had multiple sexual partners all the time). the king was frustrated by this but couldn't do anything because she was extremely beautiful. one day the king had to leave for war but he knew that his wife would have sex with a lot of men in his absence, so the clever king inserted a blade in her vagina before leaving. a few weeks later the king returned from the victorious war, and a lot of joy and pomp was observed in the village. after getting back the king had to know how many people had sex with his wife, so he went to every house in the kingdom and pulled down the pants and underwear of every man in the house. to his disappointment everyone's dick was cut off because of the blade; from the peasants and farmers to the chief minister and advisors, all had their dicks cutt off because every man in the kingdom had sex with the queen. the king was infuriated and very dissapointed, as he was inspecting the last houses of the kingdom, he came across a man who's dick was intact. it was a very small penis but it  wasn't cut. seeing this, the king became extremely happy and impressed by him and he said,"i am proud of you, young man! you have proven to be the most loyal person in this kingdom! tell me what you would like and i shall shower you with gifts!" to that, the man disappointingly blabbered, "awahaheahshwaswassah    awahaha   awhahshshwa"	4

timmy just loves clowns. favourite thing in the world. he's got clown bed spread, posters in his room, the whole shabang. totally idolizes them  one day, timmy sees that the big top circus is coming to town. he gets so excited that, when it finally arrived, he camps outside the ticket booth, waitimg to get the best seat in the house. and when he gets it, he camps for another two weeks outside the big top in anticipation.  the circus finally comes around to starting, and timmy is ready. he buys his big popcorn and soda, and sits in the front row. the lights dim. then the elephants come out on their balls, then the tigers and the acrobats. then the clowns roll up in their mini vw beatle, all piling out one by one. then the head clown steps out and heads straight for timmy, who is bristling with excitement.  "are you the horse's head?" the clown asks. timmy was dumbfounded, not knowing how to respond. "then you must be the horse's ass!" the clown finishes. the crowd roars with laughter  himself decimated. his idol, role models, had just humiliated him in front of hundreds of people. so timmy made a plan.  for the next few years, timmy dedicates himself to studying the art of witty comebacks. all through highschool and into college he obsesses over it, finally graduating with an english degree majoring on witty comebacks. timmy then goes on to found his own school, the university of witty comebacks, where he can teach people in the art of the comeback.  then, after a few decades, he sees the big top circus is back in town. so he camps out for two weeks in front of the ticket booth, and gets the very best seat in the house. then waits another two weeks before the show starts again.  he goes in without popcorn or a drink. he needs to focus, make sure he is perfect. then the lights fade. and the elephants come out, and the tigers and acrobats, and finally the clowns. just like before they all pile or if their vw beatle, and the head clown walks straight up to timmy  "are you the horse's head?" asks the clown.  timmy grabs the microphone and yells  "fuck you, clown!"	6
