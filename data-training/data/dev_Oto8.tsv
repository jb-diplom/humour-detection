why was 6 afraid of 7?  i've told this story to many naive greens before me, so self-absorbed in their own notions of human conflict and the meaning of war. whenever i finish the tale they're always pale as lyndon b's corrupt lyin' ass. i can't blame 'em. this story kept me up throughout my whole deployment in those damn jungles. worse still, i was the "protagonist" of this story, if you can call me that. it was october, 1972. we were stationed along the ho chi minh trail to intercept supplies going through a triage of enemy villages 112 kilometers north of the capital. my platoon had set up an encampment on the southside hill in relation to these villages when gunfire began raining down on us. we did what we were trained to do, although i could tell the rest of the boys were scared out of their minds. i can't blame 'em. but when the gunfire became sweeping towards our position from farther south was when we all realized we were in some deep shit. we were rats snapped snug into a trap. we called for reinforcements, but the higher ups all had their hands tied up in other ambushes throughout the valley. air support was limited, although we relished the brief pauses in the bloodshed it would give us when they dropped the bombs on the hostiles. during one of the enemy waves i lost four of my fingers to enemy grenade shrapnel. a norwegian recruit, sven alfoldssen, saved my ass during that same encounter. the men began calling me "six", and alfoldssen "seven". we became pretty good friends. we shared a few drinks together, spoke about our women, reminisced about times before we were drafted into this whole shit show. but we were proud to serve, and would die for our respective countries willingly if it meant stopping the commies from encroaching on our freedoms. but that all changed after a few weeks of no reinforcements and dwindling supplies. some men began eating flour mixed with dirt to sate their unrelenting appetites. there were some scuffles for the last few mres that got pretty violent. before we had some hope help would arrive to push the commies off the hill to get us some goddamn food. now, it was no secret we were in some dire fucking straits. three weeks passed since the last mre was eaten. if the viet cong made a significant offensive on our position during then, we would've certainly kissed all our lives goodbye. the men found it hard just to stand up in the morning. our rip-cages were all showing, and we just started isolating ourselves from one another. there's no point in making small talk if all you can think about is the next bite to eat. this is where i'm struggling to recollect my thoughts. it's not that i \\*can't\\* remember, mind you. i don't \\*want\\* to remember. who on this fucking marble called planet earth \\*wouldn't\\* want to forget this? seven began talking to me for the first time in three days. i didn't want to reciprocate, because i had to patrol the perimeter that day and he was obviously compromising my position with his banter. he was saying some shit about one of our foreign recruits hailing from germany. saying things like "we should take him by surprise" and "he'd make for some nice company during dinner." i mostly ignored what he said, but the little i retained sent chills up my spine. that night, i went to see how the german was doing. this was the worst mistake of my life, and what i saw would never leave my memories till the day i die. i opened up the tent and saw seven with a bloody fistful of the german over his mouth. i saw the poor man moaning his dying breaths as seven bit on his intestines. i'll never forget what the german said. \\*nein ... nein ...\\*. in absolute rage, i grabbed a nearby rope and strangled the cannibal seven to death. i strangled to death a man who was once my friend. when the deed was done, the german had already passed. i cried, holding his bloodied head in my arms. i couldn't find a dogtag on the german's body. seven must've thrown it away somewhere in some inane attempt to cover-up his crime. the rest of my comrades, upon hearing about what happened, began calling the poor soul "nein". reinforcements and supplies arrived a couple days afterwards. after a few weeks in the hospital, we were sent back into the thick of it all. war is like that. it never forgets, but also never cares. i've told this story to so many naive greens during my time in these jungles. this story kept me up through it all, and not in a good way. i'll never forget what i saw that night. when i saw how sven ate nein.	7

my brother and i both went to the mall today. we were both hanging around, having a nice time together. then suddenly out of a blue, a guy came up to us, holding a lighter in his hand. he looked awfully fishy and he gave us a strange stare.    "hey, boys. ya mind if i ask ya a question?"   "what is it?" my brother asked, unperturbed by the man's strange behaviour.   "i just wanted to know... you two know each other well?" he raised his eyebrow.   "what? of course we do!" i replied, confused.   "i see, i see..." the man nodded his head mysteriously. "lemme guess... you're related? siblings, maybe?"   "yeah, you got it. why do you ask?" my brother asked, now as perplexed as i was.   "heh, it's nothing. it's just as i thought, huh..." the man took his lighter and turned it on.   "wait, what the hell are you doing with that thing?" i asked, a bit nervous now. the man didn't respond. instead, he took his lit lighter towards us. we both backed away, but he approached us.   soon, we had to call for help. it was clear this man was trying to burn us, for whatever reason. thankfully, the other mallgoers nearby heard our cries and managed to come and get him away from us. he still tried to approach us, however.   "sir, put the lighter down!"   "you're going to hurt them!"   "wait, wait! why're you guys tryna stop me?" the man asked. "is it wrong for a man to try and smoke now?"   "smoke?!" i cried out. "what the hell?! are we just cigarettes to you?!"   the man then looked me in the eye clearly.   "yeah. i thought you just said you were mall-bros, sonny."	5

a man walks into a restaurant with a rooster under his arm. a limousine stops before a restaurant and a well dressed man steps out, with a rooster under his arm.  after he's shown to a private table, he puts the rooster on the table and orders every item on the menu.  flabbergasted, the waiter asks: "excuse me sir, but are you sure you want all this, it's quite a bit of food."  unfazed, the man replies:  "no, no, this is for the bird. for me, just bring me a glass of water and a salad."  at that point the waiter goes "the customer is always right" and starts bringing the mountain of food.  true enough, the rooster starts eating.. and eating.. and eating, slowly making his way trough all that food.  the waiter can no longer contain his curiosity and asks the man what the deal is with that rooster.  the man smiles and answers:  "well, you see.. a few years ago i was in egypt and found an old rusted oil lamp. i rub it and lo and behold, a genie jumps out and says i get three wishes."  "so my first wish was: i want so much money, that i must throw it away, because i don't know where to put it. and i got it."  "my second wish was: i want so many women, that i must kick them for them to leave them alone. and, heh, i'm well covered in that department."  the man then sighs and is lost in thought for a while, so the waiter prods him on:  "and the third wish?"  a bit  reluctantly, the man continues:  "there we had a bit of a miscommunication, i'm afraid. you see, i asked for an insatiable cock..."	6

a joke my dad, who is polish, tells me all the time so i'm convinced it must be real funny it is the cold war and there is a global military convention where each military boasts how their army is the best. after a long day of watching each country's army marching with their strongest and most masculine men, the generals sit down in the banquet hall. an american, german, and soviet general all sit at the same table and they are all waiting for a chance to come out as the strongest military.  the soviet general begins first by boasting, "our comrades are the strongest soldiers in the world because they eat 4000 calories of glorious motherland food every day!"  the german general, with a grin on his face states, "each und every von of our soldiers eats 5000 kaloriez per day!"  the american general finally declares "yeah? well our killin machines motherfuckers chow down 7000 calories per day, guaranteed!"  it gets real quiet at the table for a moment as the german and soviet generals are shocked at how much the american soldiers eat. then rustling can be heard coming from the soviet general as he pulls out his handy mini pocket calculator and performs a spectularly complex calculation.  "that is impossible!" he states, "there is no way an adult male can consume 50 kilos of potato in one day"	1

a tale of two friends !!  one was a very bright student while the other one was quite dumb. the brighter one always helped the other passing exams be it a class test or end term exams. the teachers were quite furious with them and at last, called upon a meeting to discuss with the principal what could be done. all came to the conclusion that both of them will be interviewed separately and have to pass it in order to move onto a higher standard. first, the brighter student was interviewed. the panel asked him "when did india get its freedom ?". he answered, " the struggle started way back in 1943 and finally it happened in 1947". the panel was impressed and asked him one more question - "can you name at least one freedom fighter who died fighting for the struggle for freedom ?". he answered, "sorry sir, but i should not name only a single one because it will be disrespectful for the others who all fought for the cause.  ". the panelists were awestruck. they asked the student to send in the dumb one after him. but, being his best friend, he told his dumb friend everything that was asked in the interview and also told him exactly what to answer. the student went in and the panelist started asking him questions. first, they asked him "when were you born ?". he replied in a very confident voice "sir, the struggle started way back in 1943 but finally it happened in 1947". the panelists were shocked and couldn't hold their laughter. next, they asked, "what is your father's name ?". being confident he answered in a very fluent way "sorry sir, but i should not name only a single one because it will be disrespectful for the others who all fought for the cause".	8

a 15 year old amish boy and his father were in the mall... ...they were amazed by almost everything they saw, but especially by two shiny, silver walls that could move apart and then slide back together again.  the boy asked, 'what is this, father?' the father (never having seen an elevator) responded, 'son, i have never seen anything like this in my life, i don't know what it is.'  while the boy and his father were watching with amazement, a fat old lady in a wheel chair moved up to the moving walls and pressed a button.  the walls opened, and the lady rolled between them into a small room. the walls closed and the boy and his father watched the small numbers above the walls light up sequentially. they continued to watch until it reached the last number. and then the numbers began to light in the reverse order.  finally the walls opened up again and a gorgeous 24-year-old blond stepped out. the father, not taking his eyes off the young woman, said quietly to his son.....

a joke is like a frog… when you dissect it, it dies.  get it? just like a frog dies when you dissect it, so does a joke when you explain it. basically, the frog is used as an analogy, to help people understand that jokes shouldn’t be explained, because the joke will die, or more specifically, become unfunny.  so, just like when a frog dies when you dissect it, so does a joke when you dissect, or explain it.	1

"she's finally gone...yeah i know, about bloody time, i'm coming to see you, put on that sexy french nightie.  i love you...can't wait to see you...we'll do all the naughty things you like."  he hung up, grabbed his keys and left.  she heard the car drive off as she came out from under the bed.  seething with rage and with tears in her eyes she grabbed the note to see what he wrote...

i hadn't put my own picture up on my dating profile, just a picture of my pickup i hadn't put my own picture up on my dating profile, just a picture of my pickup.  but that's okay, because she'd just put a picture of her dog.  i sent her a message, something almost-clever like "your dog can ride in my pickup any time," and she responded.  we clicked pretty quickly, and started chatting regularly.  every day, sometimes throughout the day.  slowly we learned more about each other.  her dog's name was daisy.  my truck's name was dodge ram (i apologized for my lack of creativity).  she was a cpa.  i was a beekeeper.  and at this, she stumbled.  "if we ever meet in real-life, i want you to know that i could never date a beekeeper."  but we were still far away from that point, so it was moot.  but time went on, and we gradually became closer to that point.  more personal information.  what firm she worked for.  where my farm was.  names of relatives.  names of high schools.  all the things that just come up in conversation eventually if you talk to someone long enough.  but, oddly, after all this time, neither of us had thought to send any pictures.  until one day i got a message from her: "i never thought i'd say this, but i really do want to meet you in person.  i think we have a rare connection, and i don't want to squander it.  i want to send you my picture, and i want you to send me yours, but i'm telling you, i can never date a beekeeper."  i couldn't imagine a life without my bees.  but i also couldn't imagine a life without her.  tentatively, reluctantly, i clicked on the image attached to her message.  then i saw her face.  now i'm a bee leaver.  edit: credit for this joke goes to u/fishamaphone	8

the sex shop fatality. a man walks into a sex shop to purchase smoe see-through lingerie for his wife. he is shown several possibilities that range from £50 to £150 in price, the more see-through, the higher the price. he opts for the sheerest item, pays the £150 and takes the lingerie home. he presents it to his wife and asks her to go upstairs put it on and model it for him.   upstairs the wife thinks 'i have an idea. it is so see-through that it might as well be nothing. i will not put it on - do the modelling naked, return it tomorrow and get a £150 refund and keep the money for myself'.   so she appears naked at the top of the stairs and strikes a pose.   ‟stone me!” exclaims her hubby. ‟it wasn't that creased in the shop!”     his funeral is on thursday.	3

"no problem," said the doctor, "i'll get it for you."     while he was gone, one of the attorneys picked up the   doctor's shoe and spat in it. when he returned with   the coke, the other attorney said, "that looks good.   i think i'll have one too."     again, the physician obligingly went to fetch it,   and while he was gone the other attorney picked up   the other shoe and spat in it.     the doctor returned and they all sat back and enjoyed   the flight. as the plane was landing, the physician   slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately   what had happened.     "how long must this go on?" he asked. "this fighting   between our professions? this hatred? this animosity?   this spitting in shoes and peeing in cokes?"	2

a time keeper at a factory is in charge of blowing the whistle for the lunch break at noon. when it's almost noon he looks at his watch and right when it strikes 12pm he blows the whistle.  one day he bumps his watch against something and he fears that it is a little off.  wanting to make sure that he can do his job correctly he decides to go get his watch set by a professional clock maker.  the man goes to the shop and has the clock maker set his watch to the correct time. he tells the clock maker what he does for a living and that it is important that his watch keeps correct time.  the clock maker tells him that he needn't worry because he set his watch by the clocks in the back and that he can be sure that they're on time because he sets them every sunday when the church bells ring at 6am.  the man leaves the shop but starts to ask himself how does the church know exactly when it is 6am?  so he goes to the church and finds the bell ringer and asks him how does he know when to ring the bells and how does he make sure that he has the correct time.  the bell ringer tells him that he rings the bells right when his watch strikes 6am and he's sure his watch is correct because he checks it every day at noon when the factory goes on break.	7

a guy is constantly suffering from terrible headaches... a guy is constantly suffering from terrible headaches. he goes to a bunch of doctors, runs any test imaginable, and no one can figure out why. one day a doctor tells him- “i think we figured out a solution, but you’re not going to like it. if we cut off your balls, the constant headache will stop”. the guy was shocked, but he didn’t want to continue the torture, so he agreed.  after the procedure, the pain suddenly went away. he was relieved that the headache was finally gone, but still felt terrible, because he didn’t feel like a man anymore.  in order to cheer himself up, he went to an expensive store to get himself a tailored suit. the tailor, who spent 50 years working there was a real pro and said that he doesn’t need to take measurements, he can just correctly guess every size.  at first the guy didn’t believe but the tailor gave him a pair of pants that fit just perfectly. then the tailor gave him a dress shirt, that fit exactly right, without any measurements. then the tailor gave him a jacket, that also fit perfectly, the guy was amazed.  the tailor said : “let’s also get you some silk underwear, it is very nice. from looking at you , i can tell you wear large. ” the guy suddenly says: “nope! you’re finally wrong. i wear small, looks like even you aren’t perfect” the tailor: “sir, i’ve been a tailor for 50 years, your underwear size is definitely large. if you were wearing small, it would squeeze your balls so tight that you would suffer from constant headaches”   edit: spelling	8

the tale of the unlicensed doctor a man walks into a doctor's office one day with full garb on. stethoscope, reflex hammer, the little ear light, the works, except none of it actually worked, seeing as they were just replicas for movies and such. he sees a lady sitting in the corner and offers to help her then and there. she says yes and he gets to work. the doctor comes back to call her and sees the man doing the exam there. they were friends in high school, but grew apart.   "hey dave," dr. marcy says, "you think you could stop? this is my job."   dave reluctantly says yes and dr. marcy goes back. dave immediately offers another exam to another patient, and soon enough, dr. marcy is back watching him do the same thing. dave drops his reflex hammer and it falls with a plasticy bang on the ground, also dropping his fake eye light.  "christ's sake, dave," marcy yells, "you're really testing my patients with all this fake doctor shit!"	2

three men are lost in the desert with no supplies, when the devil appears before them. the devil looks at their skin and bones, their cracked lips, and says, “i see you’re in a bit of a rough spot. i can help you - let’s play a little game. you each get one chance to name a task i can’t do. if you succeed, i’ll save you.”  the first man immediately replies, “i bet you can’t build a highway that goes around the entire world!” the devil snaps his fingers, and instantly, a road appears that circles the globe. the first man expires on the spot from a mixture of thirst and despair.  the second man, looking at the corpse of his friend, thinks for a minute. he thinks of his job, his family, his friends, and the life he has to return to.   after spending some time drawing figures in the sand and doing some calculations, he hesitantly says, “there’s no possible way you can build a ladder that reaches space.” but the devil simply smirks and taps his pitchfork on the ground, and at once, a ladder to the stars appears. the second man perishes where he stands, muttering the name of his wife and children until his last breath.  the third and final man calmly looks at the bodies of his companions and sits down in the sand to brainstorm. he thinks of the time his spouse first kissed him, the moment he first saw his son, and the last words of his late father telling him how proud he was of him.   having made up his mind, he quietly tells the devil, “first make a chair.” puzzled, the devil creates a simple wooden chair.   “next, poke 20 holes in it about an inch in diameter.” the devil follows these instructions. the man suddenly pulls down his pants, sits on the chair, and passes a loud fart.   as the devil looks on in amazement, the man stands up and asks “which hole did i fart through?”   so the devil points to the hole three rows down, in the second column. “that one.” and sure enough, it is.  but the man smiles and bends over, pointing to his rear, and replies, “wrong - i farted through this hole.”	6

for the last time, no! no! noooo! so, there's this man. he's young, healthy, reasonably attractive, good job, etc.  only problem is, he has a 25 inch penis. this might might sound great if you're a 12 year old, but it soon becomes the bane of his existence. every time he meets a nice lady, eventually things lead to the bedroom and without fail, they all run screaming. he can't seem catch a break.  fed up, the man goes to the doctor and tells him of his woes, shows him his giant problem, asking if anything can be done for him.  "i'm sorry," the doctor replies. "the only thing that we can do to reduce the size of your penis is surgery. it's not covered by your insurance, unfortunately, and as an elective procedure, its exorbitantly expensive."  the man slumps his shoulders, crestfallen and dismayed. seeing his reaction, the doctor grows sympathetic.   "you know", he begins. "it's a long shot but there's something you could try"   the man perks up, filled with hope.   "please, please tell me, doctor. i'll do anything" he says.   the doctor takes a deep breath.   "ok. you know the woods over on the south side of town?"   the man nods, curious as the doctor continues.   "well, if you go into the woods you'll come across a trail. and if you take that trail for about 5 miles, you'll come to a small pond."   the man listens intently, unsure of what this doctor could be getting at.   "now, near the deep end of the pond you'll find a lily pad, and on top of the lily pad, you'll find a frog."   the man gives the doctor his undivided attention, his mind racing at how any of this information could possibly help him. the doctor continues.   "you walk up to the frog. make your wish silently to yourself and then you ask the frog to marry you. when the frog says no, your wish will be granted."   the man is angry. this doctor got his hopes up only to play the cruelest of pranks on him. he gets up and storms out in a huff.   a month goes by, and another lovely woman he just knows could be the one flees in terror from him after the 3rd date. the man is beside himself with despair.   on one particularly low afternoon, the man decides to go for a long walk. by chance, he finds himself on the south side of town and stops before a line of trees leading to a stretch of woods beyond.   wandering through the woods, the man comes to a path leading deeper in. almost without thinking, the man begins to follow it. after walking just long enough to forget why he's walking, the man sees the trail end off in the distance. as he gets closer, he sees that beyond the trail is a small pond.   it can't be, he tells himself. there's no way the doctor's story could be true.   sure enough, at the deep end of the pond, he sees a lily pad, and a large, cartoonishly green frog sitting on top.   the man is bewildered. the frog looks at him, staring straight into his eyes. am i really going to do this? he slowly walks up to the frog, repeating to himself, "i wish i had a smaller penis", over and over.   he reaches the frog and asks, "hey frog. will you marry me?"   the frog blinks, eyes still locked to the man, and calmly says, "no." immediately, his penis shrinks 5 inches.  the man is shocked and elated. he can't believe it worked. he's just about to turn back home when he thinks to himself, 20 inches is still way too long. he steels himself to try again, and walks up to the frog a second time.   "hey frog," he says, a bit louder"will you marry me!?"   the frog says again, matching the man's tone "no!" his penis shrinks another 5 inches.  the man can barely contain himself. he's overcome with joy and he thinks to himself, just one more time and it'll be perfect!   he proudly walks up to the frog and shouts, "hey frog, will you marry me!?!?"   the frog immediately replies, "for the last time, no, no, noooo!!!"	6

two aliens and a gas pump two aliens land next to a petrol station on a lonely highway.  they leave their ship and waddle towards the first thing that looks like a life form - a gas pump.  "earthling, take me to your leader", utters the first alien in a harsh voice. obviously he is not getting any response. "earthling, take me to your leader!", he repeats now with a stern look on his face.  after the gas pump is not responding to his second attempt he pulls out his laser blaster and says "if this earthling is not paying any respect i will teach him some!"  "ehm. do what you think is right", his buddy says, "but wait until i got some safety distance".  slightly surprised the first alien lets his companion waddle about 50m away from the petrol station, before he aims again his weapon at the gas pump. "earthling, take me to your leader immediately!", he yells and a few seconds later pulls the trigger.  after the huge explosion he finds himself a good distance away from what is left of the petrol station. moaning and lying in the dirt he asks his friend "why you didn't warn me if you knew what would happen?"  "i didn't know this would happen", he replies, "but i am smart enough not to challenge someone who can wrap his penis twice around his hips and still stick it in his ear!"	5

a newly hired operations manager spends a week with the outgoing operations manager in order to learn his new duties and responsibilities. as the outgoing manager gets ready to leave for good, he tells the new manager that he has placed three numbered envelopes in the top drawer of the desk. he tells the new manager that each time he runs into a crisis that he cannot solve to open an envelope, starting with the first one, and follow the instructions inside.  for the first couple of months, everything seemed to be moving smoothly for the new manager until some issues with production developed and his division began to underperform. trying to figure out what to do, he went to the envelopes and opened the first one. the note inside said: "blame everything on your predecessor since he's gone and isn't here to defend himself." so the new manager blames the present problems on the previous operations manager and everything works out.  about a year into the job, something causes the poducts to have defects which then causes a dip in sales for the company. not knowing how to solve this problem, the manager goes to his desk and opens the second envelope. the note says: "reorganize." so the manager reorganizes his division and the company recovers.  another year goes by when a shortage of raw materials causes the cost of production to sky rocket and the manager can no longer stay on budget while meeting his production quota. unable to think of a solution, he goes and opens the third and final envelope. in it was a note with instructions that read: "prepare three envelopes."	1

a farmer had a problem; his hogs were not mating. at the feed store he ran into the local veterinarian and asked for advice. the vet said, “farmer heffelfinger here had that same issue and managed to resolve it himself by artificial insemination”.  the farmer, not knowing exactly what that term meant asked how he will know if it has worked.  “well, they’l be real sleepy the next day”.  back on the farm he loads all the pigs in his flat bed truck, drives them out to the back 40, and screws them all himself. the next morning he looks out the farm house window and sees the pigs behaving as usual. so, he loads them up and screws them all again. the next morning he’s too exhausted and sore to get out of bed and asks his wife to take a peak out and report on the pigs activity level. “you’re not going to believe this...they’re all in the flat bed and one of them is behind the wheel honking the horn.”	3

a politician dies... and ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. saint peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.  "so, you're a politician..." "well, yes, is that a problem?" "oh no, no problem. but we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in hell. after that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!"  "wait, i have to spend a day in hell??" says the politician. "them's the rules" says st peter, clicks his fingers, and woomph, the guy dissapears... and awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in hell. cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... nothing. just the smell of, is that fabric softener? and cut grass, this can't be right?  "open your eyes!" says a voice. "c'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!". nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. a nice one too. wait, this is a penthouse suite... and there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. "who are you??" the politician asks. "well, i'm satan!" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. "welcome to hell!" "wait, this is hell? but... where's all the pain and suffering?" he asks. satan throws him a wink. "oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. anyway, this is your room! the minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. but enough of this! it's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..." slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. "it's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!" says satan, answering his unasked question. so they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. and as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. and out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. he spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with marylin monroe). as everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... and they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. after 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... and is woken up by st peter. "so, that was hell. wasn't what you were expecting, i bet?" "no sir!" says the man. "so then" says st peter "you can make your choice. it's hell, which you saw, or heaven, which has choral singing, talking to god, white robes, and so on". "well... i know this sounds strange, but on balance, i think i'd prefer hell" says the politician. "not a problem, we totally understand! enjoy!" says st peter, and clicks his fingers again.  the man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. as he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. a sudden bolt of lightning reveals satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. "what's this??" he cries. "where's the hotel?? where's my wife??? where's the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???"  "ah", says satan. "you see, yesterday, we were campaigning. but today, you voted..."	8

when beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard.  a couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where beethoven was buried. terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. the priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.   when the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "ah, yes, that's beethoven's ninth symphony, being played backwards."   he listened a while longer, and said, "there's the eighth symphony, and it's backwards, too. most puzzling." so the magistrate kept listening; "there's the seventh... the sixth... the fifth..."   suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, "my fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. it's just beethoven decomposing.	7

an extremely modest man was in the hospital for a series of tests... the last of which had left his bodily systems extremely upset. upon making several false alarm trips to the bathroom, he figured that the latest episode was just that, so he stayed put.  suddenly, however, he filled his bed with diarrhea and was embarrassed beyond his ability to remain rational. in a complete loss of composure, he jumped out of bed, gathered up the bed sheets, and threw them out the hospital window.  a drunk was walking by the hospital when the sheets landed on him. the drunk started yelling, cursing, and swinging his arms violently, in an attempt to free himself of the sheets. he ended up with the soiled sheets in a tangled pile at his feet.  as the drunk stood there, staring down at the sheets, a hospital security guard who had witnessed the entire incident, walked up to him and asked, "what the heck is going on?"  the drunk, still staring down at the sheets, replied, "i think i just beat the shit out of a ghost."	7

a panicked mathematician rushes into his professors’s office... the professor looks up in shock from his work to see one of his students slamming a high school geometry textbook on his desk.   “what’s wrong?!” exclaims the professor.  “they’ve updates the syllabus,” the mathematician replies.  the professor, still confused, watches the mathematician frantically flip through page after page of textbook until he lands on one littered with questions.  “sir, just look at this maths problem,” the mathematician explains, pointing to a particular geometry question, “there’s a detailed explanation beside it with step-by-step instructions! now high school students will never be challenged and never retain enough knowledge from mathematics!”  the professor looks at the question, and sure enough there was a written procedure to solve each question.  “the students won’t apply the relating formulas to solve anything because it’s already written for them!” says the professor in frustration.  “exactly!” responds the student.  the professor thinks for a moment, and then says, “so these new-clear questions... they’re weapons of maths destruction!”	2

seven lessons of life **lesson 1:**  a man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. the wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. when she opens the door, there stands bob, the next door neighbour. before she says a word, bob says, “i’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” after thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of bob.  after a few seconds, bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. the woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. when she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…  “who was that?” “it was bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “great!” the husband says, “did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”  *moral of the story:*  if you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.  **lesson 2:**  a sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. they rub it and a genie comes out. the genie says, “i’ll give each of you just one wish” “me first! me first!” says the administration clerk. “i want to be in the bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” poof! she’s gone. “me next! me next!” says the sales rep. “i want to be in hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of pina coladas and the love of my life.” poof! he’s gone. “ok, you’re up,” the genie says to the manager. the manager says, “i want those two back in the office after lunch.”  *moral of the story:*  always let your boss have the first say  **lesson 3:**  a priest offered a lift to a nun. she got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. the priest nearly had an accident. after controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. the nun said,”father, remember psalm 129?” the priest removed his hand. but, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. the nun once again said, “father, remember psalm 129?” the priest apologized “sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. on his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up psalm 129. it said, “go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”  *moral of the story:*  if you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity  **lesson 4:**  a crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. a rabbit asked him, ”can i also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” the crow answered: “sure, why not.” so, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.  a fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.  *moral of the story:*  to be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up  **lesson 5:**  power of charisma  a turkey was chatting with a bull “i would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but i haven’t got the energy.” “well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “they’re packed with nutrients.” the turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. the next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.  *moral of the story:*  bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there  **lesson 6:**  a little bird was flying south for the winter. it was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. while he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. as the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. the dung was actually thawing him out! he lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. a passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.  *moral of the story:*  1. not everyone who shits on you is your enemy 2. not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend 3. and when you’re in deep shit, it’s best to keep your mouth shut!  **lesson 7:**  the psalm 129 and it doesn't contain the words "go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."  *moral of the story:*  don't believe everything posted on reddit, dummy	8

“forgive me father, for i have sinned.”    a man goes to the confessional and begins “forgive me father, for i have sinned.”  “what is your sin, my son?” the priest asks back.”well,” the man starts, “i used some horrible language this week and i feel absolutely terrible.” “when did you use this awful language?” asks the priest.  “i was golfing and hit an incredible drive that looked like it was going to go over 250 yards, but it struck a phone line that was hanging over the fairway and fell straight down to the ground after going only about 100 yards.”  “is that when you swore?” “no, father,” says the man.  “after that, a squirrel ran out of the bushes and grabbed my ball in his mouth and began to run away.”  “is that when you swore?” asks the father again. “well, no,” says the man.  “you see, as the squirrel was running, an eagle came down out of the sky, grabbed the squirrel in his talons and began to fly away!”  “is that when you swore?” asks the amazed priest. “no, not yet,” the man replies.  “as the eagle carried the squirrel away in his claws, it flew toward the green. as it passed over a bit of forest near the green, the squirrel dropped my ball.”  “did you swear then?” asks the now impatient priest.  “no, because as the ball fell it struck a tree, bounced through some bushes, careened off a big rock, and rolled through a sand trap onto the green and stopped within six inches of the hole.”  the priest sighs, “you missed the putt, didn’t you??”	5

"i'm a great gambler, and i can prove it," says grandpa. "how about a demonstration?"  the auditor thinks for a moment and said, "okay. go ahead."  grandpa says, "i'll bet you a thousand dollars that i can bite my own eye."  the auditor thinks a moment and says, "it's a bet."  grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. the auditor's jaw drops.  grandpa says, "now, i'll bet you two thousand dollars that i can bite my other eye."  now the auditor can tell grandpa isn't blind, so he takes the bet. grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye.  the stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with grandpa's attorney as a witness. he starts to get nervous.  "want to go double or nothing?" grandpa asks. "i'll bet you six thousand dollars that i can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between."  the auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there's no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.  grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can't make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he ends up urinating all over the auditor's desk.  the auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. but grandpa's own attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.  "are you okay?" the auditor asks.  "not really," says the attorney. "this morning, when grandpa told me he'd been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you'd be happy about it!"	8

a young man was wandering, lost, in a forest when he came upon a small house .  knocking on the door he was greeted by an ancient chinese man with a long, gray beard. "i'm lost," said the man. "can you put me up for the night?"      "certainly," the chinese man said, "but on one condition. if you so much as lay a finger on my daughter i will inflict upon you the three worst chinese tortures known to man."      "ok," said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. before dinner the daughter came down the stairs. she was young, beautiful and had a fantastic figure. she was obviously attracted to the young man as she couldn't keep her eyes off him during the meal. remembering the old man's warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. but during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. he was careful to keep everything quiet so the old man wouldn't hear and, near dawn, he crept back to his room, exhausted but happy.      he woke to feel a pressure on his chest. opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read, "chinese torture 1: large rock on chest." "well, that's pretty crappy," he thought. "if that's the best the old man can do then i don't have much to worry about." he picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw the boulder out. as he did so he noticed another note on it that read "chinese torture 2: rock tied to left testicle." in a panic he glanced down and saw the line that was already getting close to taut. figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration, he jumped out of the window after the boulder. as he plummeted downward he saw a large sign on the ground that read, "chinese torture 3: right testicle tied to bedpost."	6

a toronto man dies and goes to hell.  when he gets there, the devil comes over to welcome him. the devil then says, “sometimes it gets pretty uncomfortable down here.”  the man says, “no problem. i’m from toronto.”  so the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 100, and the humidity up to 80. he then goes back to the toronto man to see how he’s doing. to the devil’s surprise, the man is doing just fine.  “no problem…just like toronto in june,” the man says.  so the devil goes back over to the thermostat, and turns the temperature up to 150, and the humidity up to 90. he then goes back over to see how the toronto man is doing. the man is sweating a little, but overall looks comfortable.  “no problem. just like toronto in july,” the man says.  so now the devil goes over to the thermostat, turns the temperature up to 200, and the humidity up to 100. when he goes back to see how the man is doing, the man is sweating profusely, and has taken his shirt off. otherwise, he seems ok.  he says, “no problem. just like toronto in august.”  now the devil is really perplexed. so he goes back to the thermostat, and turns the temperature down to minus 150 degrees. immediately, all the humidity in the air freezes up, and the whole place (meaning hell) becomes a frigid, barren, frozen, deathly cold wasteland.  when he goes back now to see how the toronto man is doing, he is shocked to discover the man is jumping up and down, and cheering in obvious delight. the devil immediately asks the man what’s going on. to which the toronto man replies…..  “the leafs won the stanley cup!!!”  “the leafs won the stanley cup!!!”  now watch the leafs win it all and make me look like a jerk.	6

a man gets in a terrible car crash and his vehicle ends up going off the side of a mountain. it was snowing and the man had broken his leg, lucky for him a group of monks were on the way back to their monastery so they took him with them. while they were healing the man they kept taking him on walks to make sure his leg was healing fine. on his walks he would always pass a golden door, it was the most beautiful door he had ever seen. if the man listened closely he could hear a faint music. everyday the man asked the monk walking him what was behind that door, and everyday the monk said “i cannot tell you, you are not a monk”. this went on the entire time he was there and after he was healed the man decided to stay to become a monk so he could look behind the door. he spent years and years training, he was told to do chores to look after animals and to solve issues that were basically impossible. after almost a decade the man was finally a monk. he asked the monk who had guided him all those years ago to show him behind the door. as they walked to the door the faint music became louder and louder. the monk slowly opened the door. what was behind the door? “i can’t tell you, you aren’t a monk”	3

two clever nuns   there were two nuns  one of them was known as sister mathematical (sm),  and the other one was known as sister logical (sl).  it is getting dark and they are still far away from the convent.   sm: have you noticed that a man has been following us for the past thirty-eight and a half minutes? i wonder what he wants.   sl: it's logical. he wants to make love to us.   sm: oh, no! at this rate he will reach us in 15 minutes at the most! what can we do?   sl: the only logical thing to do of course is to walk faster.  a little while later...   sm: it's not working.   sl: of course it's not working. the man did the only logical thing. he started to walk faster, too.   sm: so, what shall we do? at this rate he will reach us in one minute.   sl: the only logical thing we can do is split. you go that way and i'll go this way. he cannot follow us both.   so the man decided to follow sister logical.   sister mathematical arrives at the convent and is worried about what has happened to sister logical.   then sister logical arrives.   sm: sister logical! thank god you are here! tell me what happened!  sl: the only logical thing happened. the man couldn't follow us both, so he followed me   sm: yes, yes! but what happened then?   sl: the only logical thing happened. i started to run as fast as i could and he started to run as fast as he could.   sm: and?   sl : the only logical thing happened. he reached me.   sm : oh, dear! what did you do?   sl : the only logical thing to do. i lifted my dress up.   sm : oh, sister! what did the man do?   sl: the only logical thing to do. he pulled down his pants.   sm: oh, no! what happened then?   sl : isn't it logical, sister? a nun with her dress up can run faster than a man with his pants down.	8

there's this bartender . . . it's the wild west and a bartender is behind the bar, polishing glasses and going about his normal day's work. suddenly,  a man bust through the saloon doors and yells, "y'all gotta get out of here! big bad barts comin!"  half of the patrons rush out the front, while the other half runs to the back room and hides. the bartender eases out of the saloon doors and looks off into the distance. through the heat rays, he sees a big dust cloud. in the middle of the cloud, he can just make out a figure. the figure looks to be riding an animal, but the bartender can't determine what it is. as the figure draws near, the bartender sees that it is the biggest, meanest, most grizzled looking man he has ever seen. and the man is riding a lion.  this spooks the bartender and he runs behind the bar to hide. moments later, the man boldly rides the lion through the swinging doors and into the bar. he dismounts and kicks the lion into the corner. "lay down," he commands in a gravely voice. he walks over, glares over the bar and spies the bartender. "give me a drink," he demands. the bartender shakily gets to his feet and pours the man a shot. the man throws the shot into his mouth, glass and all. chewing on the glass, the man leans on the bar to rest.  the bartender nervously asks, "you want another?"  to which the man replies, "hell no. ain't you heard? big bad barts comin."	3

"um...well, son. they're making puppies...."  the boy watched the dogs as they passed by, totally confused by what he was seeing.  later that night, the boy was awakened by noises coming from his parent's bedroom.  the boy snuck over to their room, pushed open the door slowly, and was greeted by the sight of his sweaty father frantically pumping away on top of his moaning mother.  "daddy! what are you doing!!!!", the boy screamed.  embarrassed, the father replied, "damnit, boy!! me and your mother are trying to make you a new brother or sister, now go back to bed!!!!"  the boy pondered for a second, "well, flip her over...i'd actually rather have a puppy."	2

"  woman: "i can't do that. "  officer: "why not? "  woman: "i stole this car. "  officer: "stole it? "  woman: "yes, and i killed and hacked up the owner."   officer: "you what?!!?! "  woman: "his body parts are in plastic bags in the trunk if you want to see.  "  the officer looks at the woman, slowly backs away to his car, and calls for back up. within minutes 5 police cars circle the car. a senior officer slowly approaches the car, clasping his half drawn gun.    officer 2: "ma'am, could you step out of your vehicle please!"  the woman steps out of her vehicle, and asks: "is there a problem sir? "  officer 2: "one of my officers told me that you have stolen this car and murdered the owner!"  woman: "murdered the owner? "  officer 2: "yes, could you please open the trunk of your car, please."   the woman opens the trunk, revealing nothing but an empty trunk.   officer 2: "is this your car, ma'am? "  woman: "yes, here are the registration papers. "   officer 2: "one of my officers claims that you do not have a driving license. "  the woman digs into her handbag and pulls out a clutch purse and hands it to the officer. the officer snaps open the clutch purse and examines the license. he looks quite puzzled.   officer 2: "thank you ma'am, one of my officers told me you didn't have a license, that you stole this car, and that you murdered and hacked up the owner."  woman: "betcha the lying bastard told you i was speeding too!"	8

"well, watch this, then, he can speak french too. parlez-vous francais?"  the parrot remains silent. the man is sweating through his jacket, and the bartender is chuckling derisively. "hand over the cash, sir, and have a nice night."  as he walks dejectedly out of the bar, the man turns to the parrot. "you jerk!", he cries. "you cost me ten bucks!"  the parrot, taken aback, ruffles his feathers arrogantly. "cost you? buddy, i just made you a fortune! think of the odds you can get there tomorrow!"	8

pope francis knocks on heaven's gate pope francis knocks on heaven's gate after his death. saint peter opens the door, looks at him and says: "welcome to live after death. what is your name?" the pope is slightly irritated and answers: "i am the pope." "pope who?", peter asks. "pope francis, you should know who i am!" the pope says, a bit upset. peter looks into his book and says: "hmm, i can't find a francis pope in here. are you sure you are at the right place?" the pope doesn't understand what's going on: "this must be a misunderstanding. i am the pope, god's representative on earth!" peter looks at him: "oh. i'm not aware the boss sent somebody down to earth to represent him. please wait a minute, i'm going to talk to him."  so peter goes to god's throne and says: "boss, there's this guy at the door, he says his name is pope and he insists he is your representative on earth. do you know anything about that?" god answers: "i don't know what he means. maybe we could ask jesus?"  so they call jesus and tell him what's going on. jesus says: "i don't know what this guy is talking about either, but i'm going to talk to him." so he goes to heaven's door to talk to the pope. a few minutes later he comes back, laughing: "peter, you won't believe this. do you remember that fishing club we've founded back in our time? it still exists!"	5

a team of nazi spies parachutes in britain during ww2. they're all well-trained, they know their mission, they have their legends. but when they're still above the ocean, suddenly a terrible thunderstorm hits them. the hurricane scatters them, some of them smash into the cliffs, others hit the waves and drown. only one last spy, by sheer luck or miracle, manages to survive and reach the shore. he crawls out of the water, numb with cold, fumbles with his straps for what seems like an eternity and finally manages to stand up, dressed in civilian clothes but wet to the bone.  &#x200b;  he doesn't even care for his mission at this point. he limps along the beach under the chilling wind, shaking, driven by one thought -- get warm. the rest will wait, he'll sort it out assoon as he recovers from this terrible ordeal. he climbs the cliff, almost blind in the dead of night, barely gets up -- and then he sees a distant light!  &#x200b;  the light is warm and orange, a speck of amber against the pitch-black sky. the spy rushes towards it, still limping, tumbles down, springs back to his feet and keeps running under the pouring rain -- if only he could get warm! as the light gets closer, the spy realizes it's a window, lit with a tender light. exhausted, he still darts forward, almost slipping on the wet stones, and he sees a pub, a good old irish pub, homy and welcoming, but above all -- warm!  &#x200b;  he opens the wooden door and walks in, drags himself straight to the fireplace and for a couple of minutes just stands there, reaching out to the fire, soaking up the heat. only after he's come to his senses a bit, he stumps across to the counter, still trembling, greets the bartender with a weak smile and stutters out:  &#x200b;  'whiskey, please.'  'dry?'  'nein, zwei.'	6

"i wonder if old gelbstein still has his shop? it's been so long since i was even in that part of the city."  so morris goes down there, and to his amazement, gelbstein's shoe repair is still there, and through the window he actually sees old mr. gelbstein behind the counter. he was sure that the shoes would be long gone, but it wouldn't hurt to ask, so he walked into the shop and greeted the old man, and showed him the 40-year-old ticket. "you wouldn't by any chance still have these shoes, would you?"  gelbstein took the ticket, said "let me check," and toddled off into the back. then he called out, "here they are!"  "man, this guy is amazing," thought morris. gelbstein comes back out and gets behind the counter. he hands back the ticket to morris, and tells him, "they'll be ready on tuesday."	5

the coach of the detroit lions had put together the perfect football team. but then his quarterback got blindsided and was out for the season with a knee injury. then his backup went down with a concussion. he tried the trading route, free agents, but nobody any good was available. one evening while watching the news from iraq, he saw a young iraqi soldier with an amazing arm. the soldier rifled a grenade on a perfect arc into a 4th story window from 100 yards, bam!  he tossed another directly into a tight group of 12 enemy fighters 80 yards away, ka-bam! then a humvee passed, going 60 kph, boom! another perfect shot!  coach said to himself, “i got to have this guy. he’s got the best arm i’ve ever seen!”  he tracks him down and convinces him to come to detroit. the kid takes coaching perfectly, makes all the plays, and long story short, the lions win the super bowl.  the iraqi is now the conquering hero in pro football, and a huge story. but when the broadcast team tries to interview him, all he wants is to phone his mom.  “mother,” he yells over the phone, “we just won the super bowl!”  “don’t talk to me,” the woman says. “you abandoned us. you can’t be my son.”  the young iraqi begs, “mom, you don’t understand! our team won the biggest game here in the u.s. thousands of fans are screaming for me. the u.s. president is going to call me!”  “i don’t care,” his mother snaps. “right now i can hear gunshots everywhere. our block is like a ruin. your brothers were beaten half to death last night, and your sister was nearly raped.”  then she says, "i can never forgive you for making us move to detroit.	8

"oh, no worries buddy." says vasya.  the communist then turns to another friend.  "petya, remember being sentenced in 1937 to 25 years in the gulag? well, it was me who went to the nkvd. please forgive me."  "no hard feelings, my friend. you are forgiven" says petya.  "kolya, i must confess to you that i had you sent to the penal battalion in 1942. i am terribly sorry about that day."  "please my friend, we all forgive you. you may go in peace" says kolya.  "thank you so much guys for being with me throughout all these years" says the old communist with a tear streaming down his face. "i don't know where i'd be if it wasn't for you. i never knew you loved me that much despite me being a stool pigeon."  his friends are visibly touched by his words. finally, gathers his last strength and says.  "and in honor of our deep friendship i want you to fulfill my last wish. see that cactus plant on the windowsill? as soon as i die, i want you to take it and shove it up my ass."  just as his friends were about to say something, the old communist took his last breath and died.  so petya rushes to the window, takes the cactus plant off and together they shove it up their dead friend's butt. suddenly, the friends hear a loud banging on the door followed by a gruff voice shouting:  "open up, it's the police. we've received information that an old bolshevik has been tortured to death."	5

a man wants to go horseback riding when the man gets to the ranch, he asks the owner if he can ride of the horses. the owner replies “looks like we have one horse you can ride, however this horse is a little different than our other horses”.  the man asks “how so?”  “this horse is religious. i ride this horse to church, it listens to the scripture, and i’m pretty sure it prays when i’m not around. unlike normal horses, it only starts moving when you say ‘thank god’”.  the man replies, “okay, i haven’t ridden many horses, but that isn’t a problem”. he hops on the horse and says “thank god?” and the horse starts galloping.  the horse is going at a slow pace and he says again ‘thank god’ and the horse goes a little faster. after a minute he says ‘thank god’ again and goes even faster. the man gets the hang of it and repeats until the horse is running at full speed.   as the horse is going at quick speed the man figures this wasn’t that hard. as the horse continues, he notices the end of a cliff ahead. he tried to have the horse change direction, but it keeps going straight. he tries to get the horse to slow down. he pulls on the reins, but the horse continues. he yell “woah woah” and “stop” but the horse is still running full speed.   the edge is getting closer and the man starts yelling every religious phrase he can think of. “hallelujah”, “praise god”, “jesus saves”, nothing happens. he screams “amen”, and the horse stops. the man realizes he was just feet from running off the cliff and signs a breath of relief and said “oh thank god”.	5

"tell you what. i really miss driving" he said to his driver and they agreed to swap seats so the pope would drive and the driver would sit in the back.  the pope had not driven a car for ages and the limousine had a powerful engine so he raced through the streets of new york running red lights and breaking the speed limit. this had to draw a lot of attention and soon he was pulled over by a traffic cop.  as the pope rolled down the window the cop could see that this was not an ordinary speeding case. he went back to his car to call his superiors on the radio.  "i've pulled someone over and i'm not sure what to do. i can tell it's a vip but i'm not sure who it is"  "a vip? don't tell me it's the police commissioner again!"

"you see mr. trump, any day you die will be a holiday in michigan."	3

"anal"tomy on the first day of their anatomy class, first year medical school students gathered around the surgery table with a real dead human body.  the teacher started the course by telling them, “if you really want to become a doctor, you have to have 2 important qualities: the first is that you have to be courageous.” as an example, the teacher stuck his finger in the  anus of the corpse, pulled it out and put his finger in his mouth.  "ok, one by one, do the same," he told his students.  the students panicked, hesitated for several minutes but ended up taking turns pushing a finger into the corpse's anus and sucking it while some even cried as they did so.  when everyone was done, the teacher said, "the second most important quality is to be observant. who among you has noticed that i stuck my middle finger in this anus but sucked on my index finger?"	6

good-bye daddy a father put his 3 year old daughter to bed, told her a story and listened to her prayers which ended by saying,  "god bless mommy, god bless daddy, god bless grandma and good-bye grandpa."  the father asked, 'why did you say good-bye grandpa?'  the little girl said, "i don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do."  the next day grandpa died.  the father thought it was a strange coincidence.  a few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, "god bless mommy, god bless daddy and good-bye grandma."  the next day the grandmother died.  "holy crap" thought the father, "this kid is in contact with the other side."  several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, "god bless mommy and good-bye daddy."  he practically went into shock. he couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office.   he was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock.. he figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay.   he felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there, drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound. finally midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.  when he got home his wife said, "i've never seen you work so late. what's the matter?"  he said, "i don't want to talk about it, i've just spent the worst day of my life."  she said, "you think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. this morning my boss died in the middle of a meeting!"	8

a man walks into a bar he's never visited before, and settles down to order a drink.  before long, he notices someone sitting in the corner - a man who appears normal in every regard except that his head is a gigantic orange. curious, the newcomer asks the bartender "what's up with the guy in the corner? the one with the-" but the bartender interrupts and says "honestly, your best bet is just to buy him a drink and ask him yourself."  so the newcomer buys two drinks and wanders over to the table in the corner. the man with a gigantic orange for a head looks up, sighs, and says "let me guess. you're here to ask about my head being a gigantic orange, aren't you?" the newcomer replies "i'm sorry but i was just so curious", and he hands over the drink.  the man with a gigantic orange for a head shrugs and begins his story: "when i was a younger man, desperate for money, i would spend my days wandering the beach with a metal detector trying to find coins or scrap to sell. one day i found a strange object - an old oil lamp. i scooped the sand away and dusted the lamp off as best i could, and the lamp started to glow with an unearthly light. before i could blink, a genie stood before me, majestic and bold!"  the newcomer looks skeptical. "a genie?" he says, "yeah right!"  the man with a gigantic head for an orange just holds a hand up and continues with the story: "the genie promised me three wishes - anything i could desire! i thought long and hard, because i had read the tales of tricksy genies who would twist your words to change your wish into a dreadful curse. after pondering for an hour, i made my first wish - i wished to be so wealthy that i could live lavishly for my entire life without working another day, and the wealth must be my own wealth, obtained through both legal and ethical means. the genie simply nodded and when i checked my bank balance on my phone, it showed a balance of billions of dollars! i was instantly one of the wealthiest people in the world, and as far as i know the genie hadn't twisted my wish."  "very clever," says the newcomer, "but that doesn't explain why your head is a gigantic orange! that's the part that i'm really interested in!"  "i'm getting to it," replies the man with a gigantic orange for a head. he orders another drink, and once the next round arrives he continues his story: "for my second wish, i still needed to make sure the genie couldn't twist my words against me. i worked for *two* hours to get the phrasing just right! having found the right words, so careful that the genie couldn't find a loophole, i made my second wish - i wished to be loved by, and to love in return, the most perfect woman i could ever meet - suited to me physically, mentally, and emotionally. the genie simply nodded, and suddenly a beautiful woman came running down the beach toward me. she instantly declared her love for me, and we started dating - in fact, we're still happily married today, and she's just as beautiful and kind and passionate as the day i met her. as far as i know, the genie hadn't twisted my wish."  "wow, that's a lovely part of the story," says the newcomer. "i'm glad it worked out well for you, but again i really must insist - please can you get to the part that explains why your head is a gigantic orange?!"  "don't rush me," says the man with a gigantic orange for a head. starting to slur a little, he calls for another drink. once the bartender drops the drink at the table, the man with a gigantic orange for a head continues: "you've been asking about why my head is a gigantic orange, and here's where you get your answer. as you've heard, for my other wishes i was so careful, i spent *hours* thinking of the right thing to say, and those wishes brought me more happiness than you could ever know, but for my third wish... well, the third wish is where i made a foolish mistake. i'll regret it until the day i die, i can't *believe* i did something so stupid! you see, for the third wish, i wished my head was a gigantic orange."	7

your life pursuit long ago in a distant land an explorer and his large team of bearers, trackers, hunters, cooks, handymen, translators and so on came upon a village of people never before known to the outside world.  luckily the translators were able to communicate with the people and soon the explorer was talking with the villagers, whom called themselves ... well, nevermind that as it's unpronounceable by outsiders.  the explorer offered the villagers gifts of whatever he had with him.  to his astonishment, the villagers chose things that were the most mundane and least valuable to the team.  as the villagers were each coming to choose their gifts, the explorer observed that each of them had many white and grey spots and drips on their bodies and clothes (what clothes they wore, anyway), and that each of them had an odd and slightly unpleasant odor about them.  the older the villager, the more spots on their person, and there was a very high portion of elderly people, of well advanced age.  as the last of the villagers trickled by, the explorer spoke with the representatives of the village.  he asked about why they all chose the least valuable items.  the representatives said "walk with us, and see our land as we speak", to which the explorer agreed, bringing several of his team along.  as they walked, the explorer noticed that the growth and good abundance of this land was vastly superior to all other land he'd ever seen in all of his travels around the world.  "we are a simple and happy people. all we need is provided to us by the great foo in the sky, whom we do not anger."  the explorer obviously recognized this as being some spiritual mumbo jumbo, but of course held his tongue and remained polite.  just then, the explorer observed out of the corner of his eye one of his team collapsing.  upon inspection, the team member was dead!  the explorer was concerned and asked the villagers if they knew what happened.  "he angered the great foo in the sky" was all they said.  the explorer had already found the villagers to be warm and friendly, so he was sure there was no foul play and the team member must have stepped on something, or been bitten by a small poisonous creature, or the like.  they continued walking and talking.  thinking of the odor he'd noticed from the people, the explorer offered "can i give you the gift of soap and teach you how to make it?"  "we are a simple people, but we know of soap.  we do not anger the great foo in the sky."  while he contemplated this, another one of his team fell over, also dead!  "kindly villagers, would you please tell me what is killing my team members?"  "he angered the great foo in the sky" they solemnly said.  it was obvious to the explorer that the villagers are superstitious and clueless, but he couldn't help thinking about the fact that there were so many elderly in the village.  as he was thinking to himself, he spotted an unusually large bird soaring in the sky rather far above them.  what could be killing his men so readily, but has not killed the villagers such that there are so many elders.  looking up at the very large bird the explorer asked "what type of bird is that?"  while the villager answered "that is foo" a bird turd landed on the explorers shoulder.  the explorer moved his hand to brush the bird turd off of him, but the villager quickly grabbed his arm and said "do not anger the great foo in the sky."  __the moral of the story is:  if the foo shits, wear it__	1

the waiter and the spoon a married couple decides to brave covid and eat out for their anniversary at a fancy restaurant. they’ve been ordering grubhub for months and are excited to support a local business in person. they order soup, but as it arrives, the man accidentally knock his spoon onto the floor with his elbow. to his surprise a waiter promptly picks up the dirty spoon and gives him a clean one right from his shirt pocket.   "wow, you guys all carry spoons in your pocket?" his wife asks.   "well sure," the waiter replies. "we need to turn tables 20% faster with all the rules in place. we had an efficiency consultant in last week and he told us we could increase overall productivity by 6.8% by carrying fresh spoons in our pockets. now we all do it."  "impressive," the couple agrees. "by the way,” says the man, “i should let you know that you have a piece of string hanging out of your fly."  "oh we all do!" the waiter replies. "the consultant said we were wasting valuable time washing our hands.  he told us to tie this piece of string to ourselves for hands-free operation. when i need to unzip, i just use the string. and since i never actually touch myself, there's no need to wash my hands!"  "i see," says the man, between big spoonfuls of soup. "so, um, how do you get your penis back into your pants when your finished?"  "well. i don't know abut these these other guys, but i use the spoon."	3

i recall the time years ago when my friend and i went on our secret spy mission. like any other highly trained operatives, we were tasked with infiltrating the local mattress store. it had been reported several times for housing a suspicious number of fans. (a code 182).   per our orders, my partner and i snuck into the establishment, taking up hiding under the blankets of some nearby display beds. sure enough, the place was crawling with fans: ceiling fans, upright fans, and worst of all, those folding paper fans. frankly, it was terrifying, but our nerves were steeled from years of spy training. remaining calm we stayed hidden under the blankets gathering intel.  but suddenly, from out of nowhere, i could hear my partner shout in horror and run past my hiding spot towards the store’s exit.  i feared the worst. was he okay? had a fan discovered his location? frightened and confused by his hasty escape, i contacted him through my earpiece. “what’s wrong?! why didn’t you stay in your bed?!”  panting in fear, he responded. “my cover’s been blown!”	3

sex therapy a doctor had a good reputation of helping couples increase the joy in their sex life, but always promised not to take a case if he felt he couldn't help. the browns came into see the successful doctor and he gave them thorough physical exams, psychological exams, and various tests. finally, he concluded, "yes, i am happy to say that i can help you." "on your way home from my office stop at the grocery store and buy some grapes and doughnuts. go home, take off your clothes, and you, sir, roll the grapes across the floor until you make a bulls eye in your wife's love canal. then on hands and knees you must crawl to her like a leopard and retrieve the grape using only your tongue. "then next, ma'am, you must take the doughnuts and from across the room, toss them at your husband until you make a ringer around his love pole. then like a lioness, you must crawl to him and consume the doughnut." the couple went home and their sex life became more and more wonderful. they told their friends, mr. & mrs. green that they should see the good doctor. the doctor greeted the greens and said he would not take the case unless he felt that he could help them; so he conducted the physical exams and the same battery of tests. then he told the greens the bad news. "i cannot help you, so i will not take your money. i believe your sex life is as good as it will ever be, i cannot help." the greens pleaded with him, and said, "you helped our friends the browns, now please, please, help us." "well, all right", the doctor said. "on your way home from the office, stop at the grocery store and buy some apples and a box of cheerios... "	8

in 1986, peter davies was on holiday in kenya after graduating from louisiana state university .  on a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. the elephant seemed distressed, so peter approached it very carefully. he got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. as carefully and as gently as he could, peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.  the elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.  twenty years later, peter was walking through the chicago zoo with his teenaged son. as they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where peter and his son cameron were standing. the large bull elephant stared at peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. the elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.  remembering the encounter in 1986, peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. he walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. the elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.  probably wasn't the same elephant.	3

"god," he said, "i've been a good man all my life.  i've worked hard, i'm raising my children well, i love my wife.  but i've fallen on hard times. please, god, help me to win the lottery".  a few days later he goes back to the church.  "hi, god, it's me again, sam.  i'm still down on my luck, there's no sign of me being able to get a job.  i'm a good man, and have been all my life.  i only ask you this one thing, to please help me win the lottery".  a few more days pass, and sam is back in the church.  he's not so happy, though.  "god, it's sam.  i'm almost at rock bottom here. and i've only asked you this one small thing. why, god, haven't you helped me?"  with this a voice boomed from the heavens:  sam, you've got to meet me half way here.  go and buy a fucking ticket!   edit: spelling (me me!  lol)	1

farmer john and his wife mary lived on a big piece of land in the middle of ohio. they did pretty well for themselves, but as all affluent farmers will know, farming is not easy money. after a few years of living together and working very hard, their marriage started to fall apart. being just as determined to keep their marriage together as they were to keep their farm running, they decided to go to marriage counselling.  sometimes they would do couple's therapy, sometimes they would go by themselves.  after one of his solo sessions, farmer john gets back to the farm and goes straight to the barn where he keeps his prized tractor that he's been working at restoring ever since they bought the property. he closes the door, walks slowly up to it, and starts stroking the wheel well. after a couple of minutes, he gets a little bit closer, telling it how much he loves its new paint job, how nice the thrum of the engine is, and starts kissing it ever so gently.  while this is happening, his brother jed walks into the barn and sees his brother engaged in this bizarre display of affection. not believing his eyes, he watches for a minute until he can't take it anymore and shouts out "john! what the hell are you doing to that tractor?"  john stops abruptly and turns around. "well, you know how mary and i started having some issues and decided to go to counselling?"  "well yeah," says jed, "but what the hell does that have to do with anything?"  john explains, "well, today, the counsellor told me i should try and do something sexy to attract her!"	4

my cake day - my favorite joke - everybody knows david! everybody knows dave!  dave was bragging to his boss one day, "you know, i know everyone there is to know. just name someone, anyone, and i know them."  tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, "ok, dave, how about tom cruise?"  "no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it." so dave and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,   "dave! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!"  although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.  "no, no, just name anyone else," dave says.  "president obama," his boss quickly retorts.  "yup," dave says, "old buddies, let's fly out to washington," and off they go.   at the white house, obama spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, "dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up."  well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.  "pope francis," his boss replies.  "sure!" says dave. "i've known the pope for years." so off they fly to rome.  dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, "this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope." he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.  sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.  making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, "what happened?"  his boss looks up and says, "it was the final straw... you and the pope came out on to the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with dave?'	6

the pianist joke a bar owner has been wanting to spice up the place lately, so he decides to hire a pianist to play there. he holds auditions and takes a day to hear some of the local talent. eventually, the final man comes in to audition and, after introductions, begins to play.  the minute he started to play, the bar owner hears an absolutely amazing song coming from the piano. he’s just tapping his foot to the beat, dancing a little in his chair, and overall having a great time listening to the music. finally, once the music came to an end, the bar owner said, “wow, that was an incredible song. i’ve never heard it before.”  the pianist confidently replies, “of course you haven’t. i wrote it.”  his eyes go wide as he asked, “really!? what’s the name of it?”  the pianist answered, “i call it ‘one kiss from you is worth twenty blowjobs from the whore who lives down the lane’.”  now, the bar owner was understandably shocked, but he just said, “well, can you play me another song?”  smiling, the pianist said, “of course i can.” and, sitting down, he started to play again. yet again, an absolutely incredible song starts up. it’s just so beautiful and heartfelt that the bar owner actually feels himself tear up a bit as it goes on.  finally, once the song came to an end, the bar owner wiped his eyes and said, “wow, that, phew, that was another beautiful song. i haven’t heard this one either.”  the pianist again tells him, “of course you haven’t. i wrote it.”  astounded at this man’s musical talent, he asked, “well, what’s the name of this song?”  this time, the pianist said, “i call it ‘when you sit on my face and tell me lies, my member grows as tall as the pines’.”  left stunned yet again, the bar owner eventually told the pianist, “listen, i think you’re really fantastic, so i’m gonna hire you. but if anyone asks you the name of your songs, do you think you could just say that it’s untitled?”  the pianist nodded and assured him, “of course i can!” and, with that out of the way, he was hired.  the next night, the pianist starts work, and immediately the bar owner can see it has an effect. there are more people around and all of them are just loving the music. eventually, when the pianist decided to take a break, he was bombarded with people telling him what a wonderful talent he was, how beautiful his songs are, and this gets him rather excited. so he excuses himself into the bathroom in order to pleasure himself.  once he was done, he left the bathroom only for the bar owner, who looked rather horrified, to run up and tell him, “do you know you’ve got cum on your hands, your shoes, your pants, and your shirt!?”  the pianist then confidently declared, “know it!? i wrote it!”	5

"please sir," says the waiter, "what did you order?"   the husband replies, "chicken surprise..."   "ah! so sorry everyone," says the waiter, "i brought you peeking duck."	8

job application... this is an actual job application someone submitted at a mcdonald's fast food establishment. not sure if they hired him....  name - greg bulmash  desired position - reclining. ha ha. but seriously, whatever's available. if i was in a position to be picky, i wouldn't be applying here in the first place.  desired salary - $185,000 a year plus stock options and a michael ovitz style severance package. if that's not possible, make an offer and we can haggle.  education - yes.  last position held - reclining on my mom's couch.  salary - less than i'm worth.  most notable achievement - my incredible collection of stolen pens and post-it notes.  reason for leaving - it sucked  hours available to work - any  preferred hours - 1:30 - 3:30 pm, monday, tuesday, and thursday  do you have any special skills? yes, but they're better suited to a more intimate environment.    may we contact your current employer? if i had one, would i be here?  do you have any physical conditions that would prohibit you from lifting up to 50 lbs? of what?  do you have a car? i think the more appropriate question here would be 'do you have a car that runs?'  have you received any special awards or recognition? i may already be a winner of the publisher's clearinghouse sweepstakes.  do you smoke? only when set on fire.  what would you like to be doing in five years? living in the bahamas with a fabulously wealthy super model who thinks i'm the greatest thing since sliced bread. actually, i'd like to be doing that now.  do you certify that the above is true and complete to the best of your knowledge? no, but i dare you to prove otherwise.  sign here: scorpio with libra rising	6

three guys three guys are hiking through the woods when they find a lamp. one of them picks it up, rubs it, and out pops a genie. it booms "you have finally freed me after all these years, so i'll grant each one of you 3 wishes."  the first guy immediately blurts out "i want a billion dollars." poof, he's holding a printout that shows his account balance is now in fact 1,000,000,003.50 the second man thinks for a bit, then says "i want to be the richest man alive." poof, he's holding papers showing his net worth is now well over 100 billion. the third guy thinks even longer about his wish, then says "i want my left arm to rotate clockwise for the rest of my life." poof, his arm starts rotating.  the genie tells them it's time for their second wish. first guy says: "i want to be married to the most beautiful woman on earth." poof, a stunning beauty wraps herself around his arm. second guy says "i want to be good-looking and charismatic, so i can have every girl i want." poof, his looks change and the first guy's wife immediately starts flirting with him. third guy says "i want my right arm to rotate counter-clockwise until i die." poof, now both his arms are rotating, in opposite directions.  the genie tells them to think very carefully about their third wish. first guy does, and after a while says "i never want to become sick or injured, i want to stay healthy until i die." poof, his complexion improves, his acne is gone and his knees don't bother him any more. second guy says "i never want to grow old. i want to stay 29 forever." poof, he looks younger already. third guy smiles triumphantly and says "my last wish is for my head to nod back and forth." poof, he's now nodding his head and still flailing his arms around. the genie wishes them good luck, disappears, and the men soon go their separate ways.  many years later they meet again and chat about how things have been going. first guy is ecstatic: "i've invested the money and multiplied it many times over, so me and my family will be among the richest of the rich pretty much forever. my wife is a freak in the sheets, and i've never gotten so much as a cold in all these years." second guy smiles and says "well, i built charities worldwide with a fraction of my wealth, i'm still the richest guy alive and also revered for my good deeds. i haven't aged a day since we last met, and yes, your wife is pretty wild in bed." third guy walks in, flailing his arms around and nodding his head, and says:  "guys, i think i fucked up."	4

a security guard and a midnight shift this is a joke my father told me long ago.  i probably don't have it word for word, but this is basically how it goes.   so it's midnight and this security guard is making his usual rounds outside some warehouse when all of a sudden, he sees a shadowy figure exit the building. the guard approaches to investigate and sees that it is a man with a bag. the guard calls to the man and asks him to reveal the contents of the bag. the man cooperates, and the guard sees that it is empty. he lets the man go.   midnight that next day, the guard is patroling. again, he sees a shadowy figure, approaches it, and sees the same guy with a bag. he asks him to open it, and it is empty, so he is allowed to leave. this goes on for days, then weeks, and months, which eventually become years.   the guard ends up retiring and goes to the park one sunny afternoon. he looks for a bench to sit, and to his surprise, he sees the "midnight man". the now-retired guard approaches him and asks if he could sit with him and the man says yes. they do some small talk, and after a while the guard says,   "for years i've been working at that warehouse making sure that nothing gets stolen and i always saw you in the area with a bag. i knew you had to have been stealing something, but could never figure out what you stole.  could you please let me know what it was? i swear i won't tell. i'm retired after all. all this time, i have been curious and need to put my mind at ease. "  the man says to the guard,  "oh, i was stealing bags."	1

a man on a business trip in spain decides to take in a bull fight    after  the event, he stops in to the little restaurant next to the venue called  "the matador".  as he checks out the menu trying to decide what he  wants, he sees a waiter bring a dish to another customer.  the  other customer starts eating what appear to be two large meatballs with  great gusto. when the waiter comes to his table, the man asks about the  dish. "oh senor, that is the matador special," replies the waiter in  broken english, "our very best dish!  fresh vegetables, beans and zee  cojones from zee bull. we get the cojones immediately after the bull  fight.  exquisito!"  "okay, that's what i'll have," says the businessman.  "but i am very sorry senor, but that dish is only available once per day."  disappointed, the man chooses another dish and plans to order the matador special the next day.  the  next day the man goes to the bull fight again, and afterwards stops  into the restaurant. just as the waiter is coming to his table, he sees  another waiter bringing the matador special to a customer who got there  before him.  "damn!" he says to himself.  "and tomorrow's my last day  here."  so the next day, he skips  the bull fight, and arrives at the restaurant early.  he is the first  one seated, and proudly proclaims, "i'll have the matador special!"  "an  excellent choice, senor!" responds the waiter.  soon afterwards, the  waiter brings out his dish, but the meat balls are disappointingly  small, and taste rather foul.  "what's with this," the now angry man shouts, "i thought this was your premier dish!"  "i'm very sorry, senor," said the waiter, "but you see, sometimes zee bull, he wins."	1

an old paratrooper joke the original one (at least the one that i know) is in hebrew. the son is joining the army and his father wants him to become a  paratrooper just like he did.   he is not in fit and he is afraid of heights, but his father told him that if he won't become one, he won't be allowed to enter his house again.  the son begins his basic training and comes home after 1 month. the son tells his dad about how the army is, and all the father care is if he did the great first plane jump. the son starts to tell his dad about it.  "well they took 50 of us, gave us our gear and we took the plane, on our way our commander explained everything again, just in case someone didn't understand.  once we arrived our destination the commander told us to jump.30 of us jumped first"  "did you jump?" ask the father in excitement.  "well no, i was afraid.  next the commander told the 20 of us to jump. if not we will stay another week in the base for duty, 15 jumped" "you jumped right? that's why you are here now" said the father.  "umm. no, i stayed week, the rest of the department came home week ago.  the commander was pissed that 5 didn't jump and said that if someone won't jump now he is going to fuck him in the ass untill he passes out"  the father looked at his son and said "you jumped right?".   the son said "yes, a bit at the start."	7

"hey goth girls! tired of dark eyeliner that just runs all day? one simple trick will fix it! find out how in the gym!"  *ok, i'll bite,* the principal thinks to himself. he walks to the gymnasium, pushes open the door...and immediately gets stuck. he looks down and sees the floor covered with flypaper glue.   outraged, he removes his shoes to unstick himself and races around the school until he finds a young man placing a note, this time aimed at math nerds, on yet another locker.   he slaps the note out of his hand and shouts:  "quit posting clique bait everywhere!!"	8
beautiful woman a bloke is sitting in the bar at a busy airport.  a beautiful woman walks in and sits down next to him.  he presumes, because she's got a uniform on, she's probably an off duty flight attendant.  so he decides to have a go at picking her up by identifying the airline she flies for thereby impressing her greatly.  he leans across to her and says the delta airline motto: "we love to fly and it shows".  the woman looks at him blankly.  he sits back and thinks up another line.  he leans forward again and delivers the air france motto: "winning the hearts of the world".  again she just stares at him with a slightly puzzled look on her face.  undeterred, he tries again, this time saying the malaysian airlines motto: "going beyond expectations".  the woman looks at him sternly and says: "what the fuck do you  want dickhead?"  "ah!" he says, sitting back with a smile on his face... ryanair!	8

so here's a story. a couple of years ago, one night, i was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped, and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. it totally ruined the mood... now i didn't know joseph that well, heck, i don't even remember where he was from, but let's say i put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.  &#x200b;  joseph had gotten a big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye, he was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend.  &#x200b;  apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together, leaving me behind without as much as a note. i tried to track them down, but never could.  &#x200b;  in conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye joe, i'd have been married a long time ago. where did you come from... where did you go? where did you come from, cotton eye joe?	5

a father passing by his son's bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. then, he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. it was addressed, 'dad'. with the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands.  dear, dad. it is with great regret and sorrow that i'm writing you. i had to elope with my new girlfriend, because i wanted to avoid a scene with mum and you.  i've been finding real passion with stacy. she is so nice, but i knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than i am.  but it's not only the passion, dad. she's pregnant. stacy said that we will be very happy. she owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. we share a dream of having many more children.  stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. we'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.  in the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for aids so that stacy can get better. she sure deserves it!  don't worry dad, i'm 15, and i know how to take care of myself. someday, i'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.  love, your son, joshua.  &#x200b;  p.s . dad, none of the above is true. i'm over at jason's house. i just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. call when it is safe for me to come home!	8

"yes" responds the nun. "with the tip of my finger".  saint peter nods solemnly and has the nun dip her finger into the holy water. she then proceeds into heaven.  he calls up the second nun and poses the same question. she responds "yes, with my entire hand".   saint peter has her plunge her entire hand into the holy water. she is purified, and enters heaven.  he is about to call up the third nun, when the fourth in line runs forward and interrupts him.  "let me go next. i'm not gargling that shit after she dips her ass in it!".	5

"oh, that's the way my mom teached me how to prepare sausages, she always made them like this for my father and myself"  shortly after this we went over to her parents for a visit, and she brought up the question :" mom, why do you cut off an inch on both sides of the sausages before baking them" "that's the way my mother, your grandmother, thaught me how to prepare them, i've never know otherwise"  as end of the year approached we had a big family gathering and also my wife's grandmother attended, and towards the end of the evening my wife and i sat down next to her "granny, we were wondering, i've been cutting of an inch of both end of sausages, because that's how mom thaught me, and she said she learned it from you, why is that?" "oh dear, it's indeed a bit weird, but it's my mother, your great grand mother, that came up with that, she surely can give you an answer"  my wife's family is blessed with good genes, and they grow quite old, so her great grand mother is still alive, and living in a nursery home. because of the years end we decided to visit her and pay our respect, and with me driving, my wife, her mother and her grand mother came along, as they were a bit curious now to.  we arrived in her room, and after paying our respects and wishes for the new year, my wife's grandmother sat down next to the bed and asked " mother, we have a question, we were wondering, we've been thaught to cut of an inch of both sides of sausages before baking them, and so are my daughter and grand daughter perparing them, it's you who told me to do it, but why is that?"  the 98 year old woman stared to the ceiling for a bit and then said agitated " don't tell me you're still using that undersized skillet??"	7

a man had some trouble lasting during sex the doc told a guy that masturbating before sex often helped men last longer during the act. the man decided, ‟what the hell, i’ll try it.”  he spent the rest of the day thinking about where to do it. he couldn’t do it in his office. he thought about the restroom, but that was too open. he considered an alley, but figured that was too unsafe. finally, he realized his solution.  on his way home, he pulled his truck over on the side of the highwy.  he got out and crawled underneath as if he was examining the truck. satisfied with the privacy, he undid his pants and started to play with his unit. he closed his eyes and thought of his lover. as he grew closer to the big finish, he felt a quick tug at the bottom of his pants.  not wanting to lose his mental fantasy or the orgasm, he kept his eyes shut and replied, ‟what?”  he heard, ‟this is the police. what’s going on down there?”  the man replied, ‟i am checking  out the rear axle, it is busted.”  ‟well, you might as well check your brakes too while you’re down there because your truck rolled down the hill 5 minutes ago.”	7

dead crows researchers for the massachusetts turnpike authority found over 200 dead crows near boston and there was concern that they died from avian flu. a bird pathologists examined and confirmed that the crows did not die from avian flu. the cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.  during greater analysis, it was noted that from the varying colors of paint on the crows, it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks and only 2% by cars. several animal behaviorists were hired to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.  the ornithological behaviorist very quickly found the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.  the conclusion was that when cars were coming, the lookout crow would say "cah, cah" none could say "truck.”	4

two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch  unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. in order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to purchase a bull from the stockyard in a far town so that they can breed their own stock.     they only have $600 left. upon leaving, the brunette tells her sister, 'when i get there, if i decide to buy the bull, i'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home.'     the brunette arrives at the stockyard, inspects the bull, and decides she wants to buy it. the man tells her that he will sell it for $599, no less. after paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her sister a telegram to tell her the news. she walks into the telegraph office and says, 'i want to send a telegram to my sister telling her that i've bought a bull for our ranch. i need her to hitch the trailer to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home.'     the telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then adds, 'it's just 99 cents a word.' well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. she realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.     after a few minutes of thinking, she nods and says, 'i want you to send her the word 'comfortable.'      the operator shakes his head. 'how is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word 'comfortable?'      the brunette explains, 'my sister's blonde. the word's big. she'll read it very slowly ... com-for-da-bull.'	7

a mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up so, he opens the box and picks up the letter. he glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters. when he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail. he thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.  a few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from. he glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address. anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient. he thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.  the next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up. he opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it. the mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.  ding-dong, ding-dong. ding-dong, ding-dong. ding-dong, ding-dong.  the door opens and standing there is a stout buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.  “pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”  “ah, my letter. thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated. please do so again” replies the buddhist monk.  “but sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”  “but that is my intention, dear man,” replies the buddhist monk. “you see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”	7

i can’t bear it a russian scientist and a czechoslovakian scientist had spent their whole lives studying the majestic grizzly bear. each year they petitioned their respective governments to allow them to go to yellowstone to study these wondrous beasts.  finally, their request was granted and they immediately flew to new york and then on west to yellowstone. they reported to the local ranger station and were told that it was the grizzly mating season and it was much too dangerous to go out and study the animals.  they pleaded that this was their only chance. finally the ranger relented. the russian and the czech were given cell phones and told to report in each and every day.  for several days they called in, and then nothing was heard from the two scientists. the rangers mounted a search party and found the scientists' camp completely ravaged. no sign of the missing men.  they then followed the trail of a male and a female bear. they found the female and decided they must kill the animal to find out if she had eaten the scientists because they feared an international incident.  they killed the female and cut open the bear's stomach... only to find the remains of the russian.  one ranger turned to the other and said, "you know what this means, don't you?"  "of course," the other ranger nodded. "the czech is in the male."	6

a young man named theseus moves to a lakeside fishing village looking for work when he arrives, he finds one of the residents, justin, is interested in going out and seeing the world, and wants to sell his fishing boat to fund that trip. thinking that it might be a good way to make a living, theseus buys the boat and spends the next few years learning the trade, establishing a customer base, and building a thriving fishing business for himself.  eventually, he realizes the village's market is saturated and he'd make more money if he could sell his catch to other towns as well. he looks into modifying the small boat into more of a barge, allowing him to carry more cargo and navigate up and down the river which connects his village's lake to the sea. eventually, he realizes he can make more money by trading all sorts of goods, and gets out of the fishing business altogether.  after spending the better part of a decade on the same shipping route up and down the river, he learns that salvage divers are making a ton of money exploring old shipwrecks in the nearby bay. he reasons he could beat the competition to finding if he could modify his boat to dive under water, making it easier to locate and salvage new wrecks. he spends a significant amount of his savings employing the best engineers he can afford, and his ship is successfully turned into a submersible. he quickly makes back his investment and is living large.  one day, while selling his latest batch of salvage in a port town, he runs into justin. after some small talk, justin asks  "whatever happened to that old fishing boat i sold you?"  theseus responds "oh, it's right here", gesturing to the ship.  "that looks nothing like my boat! are you crazy?"  theseus thought about it for a second, and between all of the years of repairs and maintenance, and all of the modifications he's made to expand his business, he's not sure that anything's left of the original ship. he then replies to justin:  "well, i suppose one thing is for sure: nothing original can be found on this sub."	5

three men were flying in a small plane when the engine failed to their disappointment, there were only two parachutes on board. after a couple of minutes of silence, one of the men said:  "look, guys, i need to take one of the parachutes. i'm a single father with three children to feed."  the other two agreed and gave him one of the backpacks. the father put it on and jumped off the falling plane.  "so, it's me or you now, eh?", said one of the two men still on the plane  "oh, just take a parachute and jump off," said the other one  "but then you'll die"  "nah, dude, i'll just take the second parachute"  "what do you mean? you just gave it to that guy that jumped off"  "i gave him the backpack where we kept the food. after all, he said he's got kids to feed."  edit: for all the critics down in the comments - i haven't heard any versions of this joke other than this one, so there's no way i'd know that it's better with donald trump or with a boy scout. it's just an english translation of a random joke i saw in my grandfather's newspaper (yes, english is not my first language).  also, here's the mandatory thank you for all the awards.	8

"you must be an engineer," said the balloonist. "i am," replied the man, "how did you know?" "well," answered the balloonist, "everything you told me is technically correct, but i have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is i am still lost. frankly, you've not been much help so far." the man below responded, "you must be a brexiteer." "i am," replied the balloonist, "but how did you know." "well," said the man, "you don't know where you are or where you are going. you have risen to where you are due to a large quantity of hot air. you made a promise that you have no idea how to keep, and you expect me to solve your problem. the fact is, you are in exactly the same position you were in before we met, but now, somehow, it's my fault."	1

the pope had become very ill and was taken to many doctors the pope had become very ill and was taken to many doctors, all of whom could not figure out how to cure him. finally he was brought to an old physician, who stated that he could figure it out.  after about an hour’s examination he came out and told the cardinals that he knew what was wrong. he said that the bad news was that it was a rare disorder of the testicles. he said that the goods news was that all the pope had to do to be cured was to have sex.  well, this was not good news to the cardinals, who argued about it at length. finally they went to the pope with the doctor and explained the situation. after some thought,the pope stated, “i agree but under four conditions.”  the cardinals were amazed and there arose quite an uproar. over all of the noise there arose a single voice that asked, “and what are the four conditions?”  the room stilled. there was a long pause. the pope replied, “first the girl must be blind, so that she cannot see with whom she is having sex.  “second, she must be deaf, so that she cannot hear with whom she is having sex.  “and third she must be dumb so that if somehow she figures out with who she is having sex, she can tell no one.”  after another long pause a voice arose and asked, “and the fourth condition?”  the pope smiled and replied, “she gotta have big tits.”	5

so there was this man who wanted to be a train conductor (long) so he works really hard at it and one day his dream came true. he was driving his train one day when he got distracted and he crashed killing one passenger. in his country the punishment for this is the electric chair. so they strap him up and then asked if he had a last wish. he asked for 1 banana. well it was a strange request but they still honored it. after he ate his banana they turned the machine on they heard it zap but the conductor was still fine. it was weird but they just let it go. a year or 2 later he somehow managed to get his job back and was driving the train again and, what do you know he crashed. but this time he killed 2 passengers. well the trial happened he was getting the electric chair again and they strap him up again and then asked if he had a last wish. he asked for 2 bananas this time. they thought that it was a really strange request but they still honored it. after he ate his bananas they turned the machine on they heard it zap but the conductor was still fine. it was weird but they just let it go. so about 5 years later he managed to get his job back yet again. he is driving again and crashed yet again. trial happened again he was sentenced to death by the chair again. they strap him up and then asked if he had a last wish. he asked for 3 bananas. this time the executioner yells no bananas this time and turns on the machine. and what do you know the conductor lived. the executioner asks the conductor, "how do you still live?" the conductor replies "i guess i am just a bad conductor".	3

'thanks,' the girl replied. the firefighter looked a little closer. the girl had tied the wagon to her dog's collar and to the cat's testicles.  'little partner,' the firefighter said, 'i don't want to tell you how to run your rig, but if you were to tie that rope around the cat's collar, i think you could go faster. '   the little girl replied thoughtfully, 'you're probably right, but then i wouldn't have a siren.'	4

a man is driving around the backwoods and he sees a sign in front of an old, shanty style house that says - “talking dog for sale.” he rings the bell and the owner appears and tells him the dog is in the backyard.  the guy goes into the backyard and sees a nice looking labrador retriever sitting there.  "you talk?" he asks.  "yep," the lab replies.  after the guy recovers from the shock of hearing a dog talk, he says "so, what's your story?"  the lab looks up and says, "well, i discovered that i could talk when i was pretty young. i wanted to help the government, so i told the cia. in no time at all they had me jetting from country to country, sitting in rooms with spies and world leaders, because no one figured a dog would be eavesdropping.  "i was one of their most valuable spies for eight years running. but the jetting around really tired me out, and i knew i wasn't getting any younger so i decided to settle down. i signed up for a job at the airport to do some undercover security, wandering near suspicious characters and listening in. i uncovered some incredible dealings and was awarded a batch of medals.  "i got married, had a mess of puppies, and now i'm just retired."  the guy is amazed. he goes back in and asks the owner what he wants for the dog.  "ten dollars," the guy says.  "ten dollars? this dog is amazing! why on earth are you selling him so cheap??"  "because the dog's a damn liar. he never did any of that.	8

when beethoven passed away  when beethoven passed away, he was buried in a churchyard. a couple days later, the town drunk was walking through the cemetery and heard some strange noise coming from the area where beethoven was buried. terrified, the drunk ran and got the priest to come and listen to it. the priest bent close to the grave and heard some faint, unrecognizable music coming from the grave. frightened, the priest ran and got the town magistrate.  when the magistrate arrived, he bent his ear to the grave, listened for a moment, and said, "ah, yes, that's beethoven's ninth symphony, being played backwards."  he listened a while longer, and said, "there's the eighth symphony, and it's backwards, too. most puzzling." so the magistrate kept listening; "there's the seventh... the sixth... the fifth..."  suddenly the realization of what was happening dawned on the magistrate; he stood up and announced to the crowd that had gathered in the cemetery, "my fellow citizens, there's nothing to worry about. it's just beethoven decomposing."	1

"but i wanted to congratulate you on yesterday's creations. for the most part, they were spectacular!"   "wha...?" god mumbled blearily. the angel held up a clipboard.   "this majestic creature you deemed "ferret!" it's as if a rodent became a dog!" he manifested one for the lord to behold. "so *cute!"*   god groaned. anxious, the angel disintegrated the ferret and hastily flipped the page.   "a-and this one was graced with the name 'kangaroo,' and look here! you put a little pocket on its belly so it could hold its baby on the outside!"   god grunted and snatched the clipboard, flipping several pages before stopping suddenly, frozen in shock. "and what in my name do we have here...?"   the angel glanced over his shoulder. "oh, um...."   he shuffled uncomfortably. "this was just before you passed out, and we were worried you'd be upset about its creation. but you seemed to like it! you were very adamant about naming it--"   "i wasn't naming it!" he bellowed in disgust. "i saw a duck fucking a beaver, and i told it to stop!!"  the angel's eyes widened. "ohh, that makes much more sense now," he said, glancing at the clipboard. "all you kept shouting was 'pull outta puss, pull outta puss....'"	1

the battle of little big horn you've heard of the battle of little big horn right? well a few months after that, while custer was lauded as a hero of the union, a museum in kansas wanted to generate some business and thought up a great idea.   the curator would hire an artist to paint "general custers last thought". once the painting was done he would hold a grand unveiling where all the big wigs would gather and draw a crowd.  and wouldn't you know, it worked. why even the governor showed up with his wife and kids. and while people were touring the museum the main focus was a floor to ceiling velvet curtain that hid the main attaction.  well after a spell, the curator went up in front of the curtain and spoke with passion about the fallen general and the seventh calvary. once he finished, he gestured to the artist who was holding the rope. the artist did as instructed and pulled the rope.  the curtain flew open  everyone's jaw dropped  the painting itself was simple enough. most of the space on this huge painting was devoted to a simple dairy cow with a little halo over its head. the rest of the painting however, the part that wasnt a massive cow, was filled to the edges with native americans having sex. every position imaginable was on display.  it was akin to the kama sutra.  once the curator had regained his composure, he turned sharply upon the artist.  "what in the name of the almighty is this?"  "custers last thought. just like you asked." the artist replied.  "well what the heck is it"  holy cow. look at all those fucking indians.	4

experience and wisdom can't be beaten due to his owner's negligence, an old dog became lost in the deepest jungles of africa.   wandering around, the poor old dog notices a leopard coming rapidly in his direction with the intention of having lunch.  just then, the old dog noticed some bones laying on the ground close by.   the dog immediately settles down to chew on the bones turning his back to the approaching leopard.   just as the leopard is about to leap, the dog loudly says:   \\- "my, that was one delicious leopard! i wonder if there are any more around here?"  hearing this, the leopard slinks away.   \\- "that was too close," thought the leopard, "that dog nearly had me."  meanwhile, a mischievous monkey had observed the entire scene, and decided to cause trouble for the dog, while getting on the good side of the leopard as well.   the monkey dashed off after the leopard, to tell him what truly happened.  the dog saw the monkey dash off, and suspiciously tailed him from behind.   he overhears the monkey spilling the beans, and quickly decides on a course of action, racing back to the pile of bones.  at the same time, the leopard has decided to take care of the dog once and for all.   the monkey hops on the leopard's back, to watch the demise of the doomed dog.   as the leopard approaches, he can hear the dog talking to himself:   \\- "where's that lazy motherfucker monkey? i sent him off half an hour ago for another leopard, and he's still not back!"  ***moral of the story:***  do not try to mess with the older ones ...  because age and skill overshadows youth and intrigue.  experience comes with the age.   wisdom comes with experience.	5

an 80yr old couple go to the doctors for a routine check up. the doctor comes back with the results and says "physically you are both fit as fiddles for your age. however mentally you are both beginning to lose it a bit. my suggestion for now is write things down when you think of them, that way you can keep on top of your to-do's".  so they go home, relatively happy. as they are relaxing in the living room watching tv, the man gets up and walks towards the kitchen. he turns to his wife and asks "would you like anything from the kitchen dear".  she replies "oo yes please, can i have some ice cream?"  "sure thing" says the husband.   "dont you think you should follow the doctors advice and write it down?" asks the wife.  "nah i'll remember it honey" he says.  "but i'd like strawberries with it too"   "okay" he says "but i dont need to write it down, i'll remember it"  the wife says "but i'd also like whipped cream with it too".  "yep, not a problem" he says.  "are you sure you don't want to write this down?" she asks, concerned.  "i'll remember it all, don't you worry" he replies and goes into the kitchen.   he's in the kitchen for a good 20 minutes and just as the wife starts to wonder what hes doing, he comes through the door with a plate of sausages, bacon and eggs.  she looks at the plate with a mixture of confusion and annoyance. she then looks at him, frowns and says "where's my toast?"	7

three friends die and go to heaven... and meet god at the gate. god tells them that he will give them cars to drive into heaven, but first they have to tell him how many times they cheated on their wives, and they shouldn't bother lying because he has a big record book of every person's actions.  god turns to the first man and asks how many times he cheated on his wife, to which the man responds "twice." god flips through the big book, and sure enough, the man was telling the truth. "since you were honest, you can get into heaven, but for cheating on your wife twice, you have to drive this 1996 chevy lumina for eternity," and he hands the man the keys.  god then looks at the next man and asks the same question. "i cheated on my wife 10 times," the next man replied nervously. god opened his big book, flipped through and saw that the man was telling the truth.  "for cheating on your wife 10 times, you will drive a rusty 1977 ford pinto for eternity" and hands the man the keys.  god then turns to the third man. "how many times did you cheat on your wife?"  "i never did."  god looks at the man skeptically and replies "you know if you lie to me, you will have to spend eternity in hell. i'll give you one more chance to tell the truth. how many times did you cheat on your wife?"  "i didn't cheat on her, god, i was always faithful."  "very well then." god said, and flipped to the man's name in his book. god looks up at the man, surprised, and says "well what do you know? you were telling the truth! here's a ferrari enzo made of solid gold to drive forever! now go enjoy heaven, my children."  they all start driving into heaven, but then the first two men see the golden ferrari stopped at the gate. they go to see what the problem is, and the driver is crying in the front seat.  "you are in heaven and you get to drive a car made of solid gold until the end of time, what could possibly be wrong?"  "i just saw my wife on a skateboard!"	7

"who is it?" asks mike sitting up suddenly. "who is it?"    "mike. it's me, joe..."    "you're not joe. joe just died."    "i'm telling you, it's me, joe." insists the voice.    "joe! where are you?"    "in heaven", replies joe. "i have some really good news and a little bad news."    "'tell me the good news first," says mike.    "the good news," joe says, "is that there's football in heaven. better yet, all of our old friends who died before us are here, too. better than that, we're all young again. and best of all, we can play football all we want, and we never get tired."    "'that's fantastic," says mike. "it's beyond my wildest dreams! so what could possibly be the bad news? "    "you're in the team for saturday."	7

when god created man, all of the parts of the body argued over who would be boss. the brain said that since he controlled the body that he should be boss.  the eyes said that without them man would be helpless, they should be boss.  the legs said that since they took man wherever he wanted to go, they should be boss.  the stomach said that since it digested the food and thus gave man energy to do things, it should be boss.  then the asshole applied for the job. all the other parts of the body laughed so hard that the asshole became angry and closed up.  soon, the brain went foggy, the eyes crossed, the legs got wobbly, and the stomach became ill. they all conceded and made the asshole boss.  thus, more often than not, the boss in the room is not a brain, but an asshole.	5

'o.k., thank you,' said the american.  he then travelled to york , durham and liverpool   in every cathedral he saw the same golden telephone with the same '£10,000 per call' sign under it.  the american, upon leaving the n of england decided to travel to scotland to see if the scots had the same phone.  he arrived in glasgow, and again, as he entered the cathedral , there was the same golden telephone, but this time the sign under it read '50 pence per call.'  the american was surprised so he asked the priest about the sign. 'reverend, i've travelled all over england and i've seen this same golden telephone in many churches. i'm told that it is a direct line to heaven, but in england the price was £10,000 per call. why is it only 50pence here?'  the priest smiled and answered, 'you're in scotland now, son .... it's a local call.'	4

an arab sheik was admitted to hospital for heart surgery.... but prior to the surgery, the doctors needed to store some blood in case a need arose.  as the gentleman had a rare type of blood, it couldn't be found locally, so the call went out.  finally a scotsman was located who had a similar blood type. the scot willingly donated his blood for the arab.  after the surgery, the arab sent the scotsman as appreciation for giving his blood, a new bmw motorcycle, diamonds and a substantial sum of money.  a couple of days later, the arab had to go through a corrective surgery.  his doctor telephoned the scotsman who was more than happy to donate his blood again.  after the second surgery, the arab sent the scotsman a thank-you card and a box of quality street chocolates.  the scotsman was shocked that the arab did not reciprocate his kind gesture as he had anticipated.  he phoned the arab and asked him: "i thought you would be generous again, that you would give me another motorcycle, diamonds & money... but you only gave me a thank-you card & a box of quality street chocolates."  to this the arab replied: "aye laddie, but i now have scottish blood in ma veins".	8

a queen told her husband, the king, "you were great in bed last night!" "but i didn't have sex with you last night," said the confused king. "how could this have happened?"  suddenly the queen realized something. she had had sex with someone else!  the king and queen knew that their servants were undyingly loyal to them, so none of them would rape them. that meant that the rapist must have been one of the three knights who were visiting the castle. but how could they determine which one it was?  they asked their wisest servant for help. "have the three knights sit naked in the dungeon," said the servant. "tie a bell to each of their penises. then have the queen remove her robe in front of each knight, one at a time, showing them her naked body. when you hear a **ding**, you will know that the knight that the queen is currently flashing is the rapist, as he is the only one who will get an erection."  so the king and queen had the three knights sit naked in the dungeon. the king tied a bell to each knight's penis.  the queen flashed the first knight. nothing happened. she flashed the second knight. nothing happened. she flashed the third knight. **ding**.  the king knew that he and his wife had caught the rapist. he decided to give him a punishment to fit the crime. he ordered the executioner to chop off the rapist's penis. the executioner bent over to chop off the rapist's penis, showing his plumber butt to everyone else in the dungeon...  **ding**. **ding**.	3

a young woman visits a florist to buy some flowers for her mother. as she's perusing, she notices the most gorgeous rose she's ever seen sitting next to the cashier, and asks for its price.  "oh, sorry," the cashier replies. "that one's not for sale. i got that as a gift from a fellow florist for hooking him up with a woman i met yesterday."  "yesterday?!" she gasps. "how did they hit it off so quickly?"  "well, he's a handsome man, a really nice guy, and a wonderful lover, of course. and to top it off," he says, leaning into a whisper, "he's got a *10-inch cock!"*  she giggles, blushing. "sounds like a catch! where can i find him?"  "he's just a block over. but fair warning...he's also a little...*kooky.* he's only interested in women named after flowers. so if i ever meet a woman with a flowery name, i send her his way."  he points at the rose. "then, he sends me a flower as a thank you. yesterday was rose. a week ago, i recommended violet to him," he says, indicating a slightly wilted violet in a vase behind him.   the woman thanks him and leaves, bitterly cursing her own name. undeterred, she visits the well-endowed florist's shop. stepping up to the counter, she pointedly says, "i heard you are particularly...*skilled*... in certain areas?"  he smirks. "so i have been told. and who might you be?"   she grins. "i was referred by your friend down the street. perhaps you can...assist me?"  "perhaps," he says, "but tell me...what is your name?"  she hesitates. then, pouting slightly, she replies "kristen, but everyone calls me kris."   his smile falters, and his head sinks as he shakes his head. kris's heart drops, knowing she's blown her chance.   "well then...if it's not too much trouble, i'd like some flowers for my mother."  "of course, what kind of...." suddenly, he brightens up again. without another word, he locks the shop door, swoops upon her, and takes her into his arms.   three hours of mind-altering orgasms later, she bids him goodbye with a kiss, as he presents a complimentary bouquet for her mother.   "and please," he says, "tell your sweet mama she is welcome to as many flowers from my shop as she would like."   flustered with ecstasy, she promises to convey the message, and calls her mother that night to tell her everything.  the next day, kris feels incredible, and stops by the original florist's shop.  "i just wanted to thank you for telling me about that dashing gentleman! he was amazing!"  he smiles sheepishly. "i suppose i should thank you too. i just got another beautiful flower for recommending you to him."  "really? what flower could he have possibly sent that was named after me?"  the florist sighs. "chrysanthemum."	8

"what is your name?"   she pouts a little and says "kris." his smile falters, and he sighs and shakes his head.  kris's heart drops. "well...then i'd like some flowers for my mother."  suddenly, he brightens up again. "i think we can make this work." he takes her hand and locks the shop door.   three hours of mind-altering sex later, she stumbles to the shop door and bids him goodbye with a kiss. "and please," he says, "tell your mother she is welcome to as many flowers from my shop as she would like." taken aback, she promises to convey the message, and calls her mother that night to tell her everything.   the next day, kris feels like a million bucks and swings by the original florist's shop.

a woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon.    as she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest. after a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, "i'm sorry, your duck, cuddles, has passed away."     the distressed woman wailed, "are you sure?" "yes, i am sure. your duck is dead," replied the vet.. "how can you be so sure?" she protested.. "i mean you haven't done  any testing on him or anything. he might just be in a coma or  something."     the vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. he returned  a few minutes later with a black labrador retriever. as the duck's  owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his  front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to  bottom. he then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.   the vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. a few  minutes later he returned with a cat. the cat jumped on the table and  also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. the cat sat back on  its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the  room.     the vet looked at the woman and said, "i'm sorry, but as i said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck."     the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..     the duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. "$1,500!" she cried,"$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!"     the vet shrugged, "i'm sorry. if you had just taken my word for it,  the bill would have been $20, but with the lab report and   the cat scan, it's now $1,500."	5

little timmy was taking a math test in class... the first question was 3+2.  timmy used his fingers  and counted 5. easy enough.  for the next question, it was 5+6.  timmy realized he did not have enough fingers so he asked his classmate,   “hey, can i borrow your fingers to do this question?”  the teacher immediately came over and told timmy to not talk during the test.  “but i do not have enough fingers to do this question.”  “just use your toes then!”, the teacher replied.  so, timmy took off his shoes and socks. he was able to count his fingers and toes and find that the answer is 11.  for the next question, it was 11+10.  once again, timmy soon realized he did not have enough fingers and toes to count.  “timmy! put your dick away!”, the teacher said.	6

a united states marine was deployed to afghanistan. while he was there he received a "dear john" letter from his girlfriend. in the letter she explained that she had slept with two guys while he had been gone and she wanted to break up with him.  to add injury to the insult, she said she wanted back the picture of herself that she had given him.  so the marine did what any squared-away marine would do. he went around to his buddies and collected all the unwanted photos of women he could find.  in all, he got more than 25 pictures of various women (some with clothes and some without).  he then mailed them to his now-former girlfriend with the following note:  "i don't remember which one you are. please remove your picture and send the rest back."	8

so there’s this farm. on this farm, there’s a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends. so there’s this farm. on this farm, there's a cow, a chicken, and a horse, and the three of them are best friends.  they do just about everything together. and one day, they're sitting at the window of the house, and the farmer's kid is watching mtv, and they're watching it, and they hear the music, and the horse says "you know what? i'm gonna learn how to do that."  so the horse calls up guitar center, and he says to the guy on the phone, "hey, listen. i wanna learn to play guitar."  guy on the phone says "no problem. come on down."  "no, there might be one problem. i'm a horse."  "naw, it ain't a problem. we'll get some attachments, i can teach you to play. promise."  so horse turns out to be a natural. he gets good. and he calls over cow and chicken and he's like "look what i can do" and he jams out like jimi hendrix. and cow says "holy shit. that's awesome. i want to learn to do something like that too. what's like that?" and horse says "bass. learn to play bass."  so cow calls up guitar center, and she says "hey, listen, i wanna learn to play bass guitar."  guy on the phone says "no problem, miss, come on down."  "eh, this might be a problem. i'm a cow."  "nah, no problem. i helped a horse recently, i can teach you to play too. promise."  so cow learns to play the bass, and cow is fucking amazing at it. so cow and horse are jamming, and chicken gets a bit jealous. he says "damn, i wanna learn something too. but not like that."  horse says "well, i mean, we need a drummer around here."  so chicken calls up guitar center, and he says "hey, listen, i wanna learn to play drums."  guy on the phone says "no problem, man. come on down."  "eh, maybe a problem. i'm a chicken."  "naw. ain't no thing. i taught a horse guitar and a cow bass. i can teach you drums."  so chicken learns the drums, and he's fucking amazing. so cow, horse, and chicken all start having jam sessions whenever the farmer's out. and one day they're playing, and a big record agent is driving down the road. and he hears them, and he's like "what the fuck? that sounds amazing." so he stops at the farm, and he finds them all playing in the barn. and he says "holy shit. you guys sound awesome. i wanna represent you, make this a real band, make some music. you're gonna be huge."  so cow and chicken and horse take this guy's deal, and they move to the city, they cut albums, and they're big. real big. top 10 hits, platinum albums, the works. they get set for their first tour. but there's a problem, see. horse gets a phone call, his mom's real sick. cow and chicken, though, they're cool as hell. they say "listen. go see your mom. we'll delay the first show a couple of days, so fly back home, spend some time with her, and then jump on a plane and come meet us."  horse says "thanks, guys. you're the best," and he takes off.  couple of days later, horse's mom is just fine. turned out to be a real bad cold, she gets over it, and he spends another night there. the following morning, he gets a call. it's his agent. cow and chicken's plane went down, they died in the crash. the band is done. he's lost his best friends. and horse, this breaks him, man. he's been through so much with them, and he feels real down in the dumps. so he takes a walk, and while he's on that walk, he just can't shake the blue, so he figures to himself "alright, alright. one drink, just to get over it."  so horse walks into the local bar. bartender looks at him and says "hey. why the long face?"	8

an optimist and a pessimist were riding a bus together when the optimist got hungry. "let's stop at the next restaurant," said the optimist. "then we can take the next bus and continue our journey."  "i don't think that's a good idea," said the pessimist. "it could cause something bad to happen."  "or it could cause something good to happen," replied the optimist, "and besides, i'm hungry!"  so the two of them left the bus and went into the restaurant.  while they were eating, a news report came on the tv.  "a bus was crushed in an avalanche fifteen minutes ago," said the reporter. "everyone on the bus was killed." the optimist and the pessimist recognized the bus as the one they had gotten off.  "see?" said the optimist. "i told you something good would happen if we got off the bus!"  "good?" sputtered the pessimist. "if the bus hadn't stopped to let us off, it might have missed the avalanche!"	8

a gorilla dies of old age at a zoo right before the zoo opens. it is the only gorilla at the zoo since they are not very profitable. however, the gorilla is their most popular attraction by far, and they can't afford to go a day without it. so the zoo owner asks one of his workers to wear a gorilla suit they have in storage for an extra $100 a day if he will go in the gorilla cage and pretend to be the gorilla until the zoo can afford a new one.  quickly, the new "gorilla" becomes the most popular craze at the zoo. people from all over are coming to see the "human-like" gorilla.  about a month in, the craze has started to wear off. so, to get peoples' attention back, he decides to climb over his enclosure and hang from the net ceiling above the lions' den next to him. a large crowd of people gather watching the spectacle in awe and terror. suddenly the man loses his grip and falls to the floor of the lion's den. the man starts screaming "help!! help!!!" suddenly a lion pounces him from behind and whispers in his ear, "shut the fuck up right now or you're going to get us both fired."	8

"who said that? " she demanded.  jose put his hand up.

the three guys at an interview joke just posted here reminded me of another version we used to tell about 20 years ago.. is it a repost? i don't know, probably yes, but does anyone really care ;) ? three guys interviewing to be a detective.  the final step is with the chief inspector who says, "ahh, so you wanna be detectives, eh? the first skill you need is perception, let's see how you guys do with that"  he calls them into his office one by one.  the first guy goes in and is shown a picture of a recently captured criminal. tattooed face, large scar, he's quite recognisable.  the inspector says, "take a close look, and i want you to memorize and remember all the features that will help you identify this man in a crowd"  after a minute, the man is done.  the inspector turns the picture over and says, "well, go on, describe him to me" the man responds, "well it wouldn't be hard to find this guy, given that he has only one ear".  the inspector stares blankly, turns the picture over and says, "what sort of a moron are you? this is a side profile of the man.. don't tell me you thought... ugh, get out and stop wasting my time!"  the second guy is called in and given the same challenge.  after his minute he says, "well, i couldn't really focus on much other than the fact that he has only one eye"  visibly frustrated, the inspector bellows, "what is wrong with you people, do you not know what a side profile is?! get out, and call the last guy in!!"  the last guy comes in and is given the same challenge. the inspector adds, "you know what, take 5 minutes.. and think carefully before you answer"  5 minutes later, the young man turns the picture over himself and says, "you know, i'll bet he wears contact lenses"  the inspector scrunches his eyebrows and then squints at the young man in silence for a few moments. not wanting to potentially get embarrassed, he excuses himself to go check the man's criminal profile. 2 minutes later, he steps back in.  a pleased but puzzles look on his face, he says, "well, yes.. yes he does wear contacts lenses. how could you tell?"  visibly delighted with himself, the young man beams back with a smile, "oh, it took a while to think of it, but there's no way he could wear regular glasses with only one eye and one ear"	8

silence or dishes    joe wanted to buy a motorcycle.  he doesn't have much luck, until one day, he comes across a harley with a for sale sign on it.  the bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old.  it's shiny and in absolute mint condition.  he immediately buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.  "well, it's quite simple really," says the seller, "whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub vaseline on the chrome. it protects it from the rain." (true story)  and he hands joe a jar of vaseline.  that night, his girlfriend, sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. naturally, they take the bike there. but just before they enter the house, sandra stops him and says, "i have to tell you something about my family before we go in."  "when we eat dinner, we don't talk.  in fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes."  "no problem," he says.. and in they go.  joe is shocked. right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.  in the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.  they sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.  as dinner progresses, joe decides to take advantage of the situation.  so he leans over and kisses sandra. no one says a word.  so he reaches over and fondles her breasts. still, nobody says a word.  so he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her parents.  his girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.  he looks at her mom. "she's got a great body," he thinks.  so he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose right there on the dinner table.  after she has a big orgasm, he sits down again. now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, the mom is pleasantly beaming.  but still.... total silence.  all of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.  joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of vaseline from his pocket.  suddenly the father shouted, **"i'll do the fuckin dishes!!"**	8

pope chauffeur after getting all of pope benedict's luggage loaded into the limo, and he doesn't travel light, the driver notices that the pope is still standing on the curb  'excuse me, your holiness,' says the driver, 'would you please take your seat so we can leave?'  'well, to tell you the truth,' says the pope, 'they never let me drive at the vatican , and i 'd really like to drive today.'  'i'm sorry but i cannot let you do that i'd lose my job! and what if something should happen?' protests the driver, wishing he'd never gone to work that morning.  'there might be something extra in it for you,' says the pope.  reluctantly, the driver gets in the back as the pope climbs in behind the wheel. the driver quickly regrets his decision when, after exiting the airport, the pontiff floors it, accelerating the limo to 105 mph.  'please slow down, your holiness!!!' pleads the worried driver, but the pope keeps the pedal to the metal until they hear sirens. 'oh, dear god, i'm gonna lose my license,' moans the driver.  the pope pulls over and rolls down the window as the cop approaches, but the cop takes one look at him, goes back to his motorcycle, and gets on the radio.  'i need to talk to the chief,' he says to the dispatcher.  the chief gets on the radio and the cop tells him that he's stopped a limo going a hundred and five.  'so bust him,' says the chief.  'i don't think we want to do that - he's really important,' said the cop.  the chief exclaimed, 'all the more reason!'  'no, i mean really important,' said the cop.  the chief then asked, 'who have you got there, the mayor?'  cop: 'bigger.'  chief: 'governor?'  cop: 'bigger.'  'well,' said the chief, 'who is it?'  cop: 'i think it's god!'  chief: 'what makes you think it's god?'  cop: 'he's got the pope as a chauffeur!'	2

a nun and a priest were crossing the sahara desert on a camel on the third day out the camel suddenly dropped dead without warning.  after dusting themselves off, the nun and the priest surveyed their situation.  after a long period of silence, the priest spoke.  “well sister, this looks pretty grim.”  “i know, father.” “in fact, i don’t think it likely that we can survive more than a day or two.”  “i agree.” “sister, since we are unlikely to make it out of here alive, would you do something for me?”  “anything father.”  “i have never seen a woman’s breasts and i was wondering if i might see yours.”  “well, under the circumstances i don’t see that it would do any harm.”  the nun opened her habit and the priest enjoyed the sight of her shapely breasts, commenting frequently on their beauty.  “sister would you mind if i touched them?”  she consented and he fondled them for several minutes.  “father, could i ask something of you?”  “yes sister?” “i have never seen a man’s penis. could i see yours?”  “i supposed that would be ok,” the priest replied lifting his robe.  “oh father, may i touch it?”  this time the priest consented and after a few minutes of fondling he was sporting a huge erection.  “sister, you know that if i insert my penis in the right place, it can give life.”  “is that true father?”  “yes it is, sister.”  “then stick it up that camel’s ass and let's get the fuck out of here.”	4

religious grandma still drives dear grand-daughter,  the other day i went up to our local christian book store and saw a 'honk if you love jesus' bumper sticker.  i was feeling particularly sassy that day because i had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting.  so, i bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.  boy, am i glad i did; what an uplifting experience that followed.  i was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the lord and how good he is, and i didn't notice that the light had changed.  it is a good thing someone else loves jesus because if he hadn't honked, i'd never have noticed.  i found that lot of people love jesus!  while i was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, 'for the love of god!'  'go! go! go! jesus christ, go!'  what an exuberant cheerleader he was for jesus!  everyone started honking!  i just leaned out my window and started waving and smiling at all those loving people.  i even honked my horn a few times to share in the love!  there must have been a man from florida back there because i heard him yelling something about a sunny beach.  i saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air.  i asked my young teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant.  he said it was probably a hawaiian good luck sign or something.  well, i have never met anyone from hawaii, so i leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign right back.  my grandson burst out laughing.  why even he was enjoying this religious experience!!  a couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me.  i bet they wanted to pray or ask what church i attended, but this is when i noticed the light had changed.  so, grinning, i waved at all my brothers and sisters, and drove on through the intersection.  i noticed that i was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and felt kind of sad that i had to leave them after all the love we had shared.  so i slowed the car down, leaned out the window and gave them all the hawaiian good luck sign one last time as i drove away.   praise the lord for such wonderful folks!!  love,   grandma	4

a pro wrestler is down to fight the mad monk, and his manager says to him: "whatever you do, don't let him put you in the mad monk hold. that's his signature move and no-one's ever gotten out of it."  but about five minutes into the fight, sure enough, our boy's all wrapped up like a human pretzel, with one arm going one way, one leg going another way, his spine all twisted and wound up like a spring and he can't even tell which way his head's on, and he realizes he's in the mad monk hold.  then he sees a familiar bulge hanging down just in front of his face, and he's pretty desperate, so he takes a deep breath and bites down as hard as he can.  moments later there is a wild scream and the mad monk is flying out of the ring, and he lands in the fourth row of seats with a godawful crash, and before he manages to pick himself up and scramble back into the ring, he's been counted out.  and our boy staggers back to his corner after the referee has held his arm up, and the manager says "what happened? how did you manage it? no-one's ever gotten out of the mad monk hold!"  and the wrestler says, "well, it's amazing the strength you find when you bite your own ballsack."	8

so this is a story i found and wanted to share it with whoever clicks on this a mom visits her son for dinner who lives with a girl roommate..... during the course of the meal, his mother couldn't help but notice how pretty his roommate was.she had long been suspicious of a relationship between the two, and this had only made her more curious....  over the course of the evening, while watching the two interact, she started to wonder if there was more between him and his roommate than met the eye. reading his mom's thoughts, his son volunteered, “i know what you must be thinking, but i assure you,we are just roommates."  about a week later, his roommate came to him saying, “ever since your mother came to dinner, i've been unable to find the silver plate. you don't suppose she took it, do you?"  he said ,"well, i doubt it, but i'll email her, just to be sure." he sat down and wrote :  dear mother: i'm not saying that you ‘did' take the silver plate from my house, i'm not saying that you ‘did not' take the silver plate but the fact remains that it has been missing ever since you were here for dinner.  love, your son.  several days later, he received an email from his mother which read:  dear son: i'm not saying that you ‘do' sleep with your roommate, and i'm not saying that you ‘do not' sleep with her. but the fact remains that if she was sleeping in her own bed, she would have found the silver plate by now, under her pillow… love, mom.	5

a 15 year old boy.... was at the center of a denver county courtroom drama yesterday when he challenged a court ruling over who should have custody of him.   the boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible. the boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her.   when the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him. after considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him.   after two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the denver broncos, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone....	5

little timmy comes home from school to find his parents in the middle of a fight. timmy's parents keep him pretty sheltered, and they don't normally fight in front of him, so he stops to see what is going on.  the argument is pretty heated and at this point has devolved to plain old shouting insults at one another.  his mother yells at his father "at least i don't have hairy balls!!"  this is a new one to timmy and he has to ask "mom, what are hairy balls?"  thinking fast his mother replies "coats, timmy.  your father has a lot of coats."  not to be outdone, his father shouts back "hairy balls?!  at least i don't have saggy tits!!"  again, timmy is intrigued.  "dad, what are saggy tits?"  "shoes, timmy.  your mother has a lot of shoes."  timmy's mother is furious.  "you bastard!"  timmy inquires again, "mom, what's a bastard?"  not even caring anymore she just responds "men.  like your father."  "bastard, am i?  at least i'm not a bitch!!"  same thing, timmy asks "dad, what's a bitch?"  and his dad, before storming off says "women, just like your mom."  seeing as the combatants have moved on, timmy shrugs and goes to his room to work on homework before dinner.  tonight is special because his parents are having some friends over for a nice dinner.  once he's done with his homework he gets ready.    once he's ready he heads downstairs.  as he's walking past the bathroom his father accidentally cuts himself while he's shaving and it's a good one.  "shit!" his father barks, still worked up from the fight earlier.  this is another new one for timmy and he doesn't hesitate to ask "dad, what's shit?"  "it's shaving cream, timmy.  go help your mother in the kitchen." he says dismissively.   timmy gets to the kitchen just in time to hear his mother cry out "fuck!" as she cuts herself carving the turkey she prepared for dinner.  good, reliable timmy says "mom, what's fuck?"  "carving, timmy.  it's just another word for carving."  and just at that moment the doorbell rings.  their dinner guests have just arrived.  "go get the door timmy, while i finish up here."    timmy, being the helpful boy that he is, trots off to greet their guests.  he's proud that he's learned so many new words today and decides that he just has to show off for his parents' friends.  he opens the door and happily says "hello bastards and bitches.  may i help you with your hairy balls and saggy tits?  dad's upstairs shaving the shit off his face, and mom's in the kitchen fucking the turkey."	4

"give me a chance misther, i'd be the best toofbruth salesman you've ever had!"  "i'm sorry, we don't really work like that. we sell our toothbrushes to stores, and they sell them. i don't actually employ toothbrush salesmen, you see. on top of that, i don't mean to be rude, but your lisp might make sales a little difficult for you. if you need work, maybe i can..."   before he can finish, the stranger cuts him off. "misther, listen. give me a chanthe. i promise i will be the greatestht toofbruth salesmen you've ever seen. misther, you gotta give me a chansthe here."  the owner contemplates it for a moment and decides, 'what the hell'. "ok pal, fine. i'll give you a case of toothbrushes, that's 2,000. you come back in a month or however long it takes you to sell them, and we can talk."   the owner gets him his toothbrushes and assumes he will never see the stranger again. the next morning however, the man is outside the factory again.  "misther, i thold every toofbruth. i need more!"  "what? how the hell did you sell 2000 toothbrushes in a day?"  "it was easy misther. i went to the airport and i put out a big table. on the table i put some chips and some dip. people would come up and take a chip, dip it in the dip, and then say, 'mither, this sthuff tastes like sthit!' and i would say, 'it is sthit lady, want to buy a toofbruth?"	1

"and would you let her wear my old clothes?"  "i suppose, if she wanted to," said the husband.  "really," said the wife icily. "and would you take down the pictures of me and replace them with pictures of her?"  "yes. i think that would be the correct thing to do."  "is that so?" said the wife, leaping to her feet. "and i suppose you'd let her play with my golf clubs, too!?"  "of course not, dear," said the husband. "she's left-handed."	7

the husband store a new store that sells new husbands has opened in new york city , where a woman may go to choose a husband. among the instructions at the entrance is a description of how the store operates:  you may visit this store only once! there are six floors and the value of the products increase as the shopper ascends the flights. the shopper may choose any item from a particular floor, or may choose to go up to the next floor, but you cannot go back down except to exit the building!  so, a woman goes to the husband store to find a husband. on the first floor the sign on the door reads:  floor 1 - these men have jobs.  she is intrigued, but continues to the second floor, where the sign reads:  floor 2 - these men have jobs and love kids.  "that's nice," she thinks, "but i want more." so she continues upward. the third floor sign reads:  floor 3 - these men have jobs, love kids, and are extremely good looking.  "wow," she thinks, but feels compelled to keep going. she goes to the fourth floor and the sign reads:  floor 4 - these men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead good looking and help with housework.  "oh, mercy me!" she exclaims, "i can hardly stand it!" still, she goes to the fifth floor and the sign reads:  floor 5 - these men have jobs, love kids, are drop-dead gorgeous, help with housework, and have a strong romantic streak.  she is so tempted to stay, but she goes to the sixth floor, where the sign reads:  floor 6 - you are visitor 31,456,012 to this floor. there are no men on this floor. this floor exists solely as proof that women are impossible to please. thank you for shopping at the husband store.  please note:  to avoid gender bias charges, the store's owner opened a new wives store just across the street.  the first floor has wives that love sex.  the second floor has wives that love sex and have money and like beer.  the third, fourth, fifth and sixth floors have never been visited.	7

making a baby the smiths were unable to conceive children and decided to use a surrogate father to start their family. on the day the proxy father was to arrive, mr. smith kissed his wife goodbye and said, 'well, i'm off now. the man should be here soon.'  half an hour later, just by chance, a door-to-door baby photographer happened to ring the doorbell, hoping to make a sale. 'good morning, ma'am', he said, 'i've come to...'  'oh, no need to explain,' mrs. smith cut in, embarrassed, 'i've been expecting you.'  'have you really?' said the photographer. 'well, that's good. did you know babies are my specialty?'  'well that's what my husband and i had hoped. please come in and have a seat!'  after a moment she asked, blushing, 'well, where do we start?'  'leave everything to me. i usually try two in the bathtub, one on the couch, and perhaps a couple on the bed. and sometimes the living room floor is fun. you can really spread out there.'  'bathtub, living room floor? no wonder it didn't work out for harry and me!'  'well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a good one every time. but if we try several different positions and i shoot from six or seven angles, i'm sure you'll be pleased with the results.'  'my, that's a lot!', gasped mrs. smith.  'ma'am, in my line of work a man has to take his time. i'd love to be in and out in five minutes, but i'm sure you'd be disappointed with that.'  'don't i know it,' said mrs. smith quietly.  the photographer opened his briefcase and pulled out a portfolio of his baby pictures. 'this was done on the top of a bus,' he said.  'oh, my god!' mrs. smith exclaimed, grasping at her throat.  'and these twins turned out exceptionally well - when you consider their mother was so difficult to work with.'  'she was difficult?' asked mrs. smith.  'yes, i'm afraid so. i finally had to take her to the park to get the job done right. people were crowding around four and five deep to get a good look'  'four and five deep?' said mrs. smith, her eyes wide with amazement.  'yes', the photographer replied. 'and for more than three hours, too. the mother was constantly squealing and yelling - i could hardly concentrate, and when darkness approached i had to rush my shots. finally, when the squirrels began nibbling on my equipment, i just had to pack it all in.'  mrs. smith leaned forward. 'do you mean they actually chewed on your, uh....equipment?'  'it's true, ma'am, yes.. well, if you're ready, i'll set-up my tripod and we can get to work right away.'  'tripod?'  'oh yes, ma'am. i need to use a tripod to rest my canon on. it's much too big to be held in the hand very long.'  mrs. smith fainted	8
a man decides to become a farmer... so he went to his neighbour to buy some animals to make a start.  first he wanted a hen, for fresh eggs everyday. "i'll sell you a hen for $2, but for $3 i'll sell you a pullet. it's much longer living and provides bigger eggs". no brainer thought the man, so he bought the pullet.  next thing he wanted was a rooster. the farmer said "i'll sell you a rooster for $3, but for $4 i'll sell you one of my cocks. it's younger and it's plumage.is far more impressive". ok said the man, so he paid him $4.  finally he wanted a donkey. "i don't have a donkey i'm afraid" said the farmer, "but i'll sell you an ass. they have a much better temperament than donkeys. if they ever get stubborn and refuse to move, give them a little rub behind the ear and they'll start moving again." so the man bought the ass too.  the man packed up his purchases, hopped on the donkey and started off home. but before they got home the ass refused to move, it stopped in the middle off the road. the man swore and slapped the ass, tried to coax it with food, but nothing would work. but then he remembered what the farmer told him.  a woman was coming up the road and asked the man if he needed help. the man said "yes please! if you could just hold my cock and pullet while i rub my ass, that would be great!"	1

the husband leans over and asks his wife.. "do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? we went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and i made love to you."  yes, she says, "i remember it well."  ok, he says, "how about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?"  "oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!"  a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.  the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..  then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.  the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.  after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.  the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.  so, as the couple passes, he says to them, "excuse me, but that was something else. you must've had a fantastic sex life together. is there some sort of secret to this?"  shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,  "fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence."	6

i recently i received a parrot as a gift. the parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. every word out of the bird's mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.  i tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else i could think of to "clean up" the bird's vocabulary.  finally, i was fed up and i yelled at the parrot.  the parrot yelled back.  i shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even ruder.  so, in desperation, i threw up my hands, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.  for a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. then suddenly there was total quiet.  not a peep was heard for over a minute.  fearing that i'd hurt the parrot, i quickly opened the door to the freezer.  the parrot calmly stepped out onto my outstretched arms and said "i believe i may have offended you with my rude language and actions. i'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and i fully intend to do everything i can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior."  i was stunned at the change in the bird's attitude.  as i was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued,  "may i ask what the turkey did?"	7

[long]husband takes wife to play golf. husband takes his wife to play her first game of golf.   of course, the wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the biggest house adjacent to the course.   the husband shouted , "i warned you to be careful! now we'll have apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us."   so the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door.   a warm voice said, "come on in." when they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the broken window.   a man reclining on the couch asked, "are you the people that broke my window?"   "uh...yeah, sir. we're sure sorry about that," the husband replied.   "oh, no apology is necessary. actually i want to thank you. you see, i'm a ghost, and i've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. now that you've released me, i'm allowed to grant three wishes. i'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, i'll keep the last one for myself."   "wow, that's great!" the husband said. he pondered a moment and blurted out, "i'd like a million dollars a year for! the rest of my life."  "no problem," said the ghost. "you've got it, it's the least i can do. and i'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!"   "and now you, young lady, what do you want?" the ghost asked. "i'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every country in the world," she said.   "consider it done," the ghost said. "and your homes will always be safe from fire,burglary and natural disasters!"   "and now," the couple asked in unison, "what's your wish, ghost?"   "well, since i've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have your wife."   the husband looked at his wife and said, "honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. what do you think?"   she mulled it over for a few moments and said, "you know, you're right. considering our good fortune, i guess i wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?"   "you know i love you sweetheart," said the husband.   "i'd do the same for you!" so the ghost and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon. the ghost was insatiable.  after about three hours of non-stop fun, the ghost  looked directly into her eyes and asked, "how old are you and your husband?"   "why, we're both 35," she responded breathlessly. ghost smile –  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  really???  thirty-five years old and both of you still believe in ghosts???	2

a young ensign in the navy was arriving at his first posting in king’s bay, a submarine base in georgia. he was assigned to one of the submarine there.     as he walked onto the base carrying his duffel a young sailor carrying a duffel joined him. after exchanging salutes they began talking. the sailor was fresh from basic training and this was his first assignment too. after further comparing notes they discovered they would be on the same submarine. they began excitedly speculating about what life in a submarine would be like. they agreed to explore the submarine when they had finished reporting in and stowing their gear.   after reporting in with the captain they stowed their gear and met up as agreed. the young sailor was animated and cheerful, commenting on everything they saw. the ensign liked him and was sure they would become good friends. as they went they met the rest of their shipmates who smiled and shook their heads at the young pair’s enthusiasm, remembering their own first day in a submarine. they ended their tour by having coffee together in the galley before going their separate ways for the evening. before parting they agreed to meet the next morning after breakfast for another quick tour before starting their new jobs.   the next morning the ensign ate in the officers’ mess and then quickly headed out to find the sailor. he was waiting and they took off together to explore the two football field long vessel. the sailor started the tour every bit as enthusiastic as he had been the previous day, but as they went he became gradually more and more subdued. the officer noticed and asked him what was wrong and the young sailor looked around the radio room before frowning and shaking his head. he didn’t look sad, just, not excited. by the end of the tour he was serious and nearly silent. the young officer was concerned for his new friend and decided he would keep an eye on the sailor and make sure he was okay.   they both headed to their posts which happened to be in the same area and the officer watched the sailor all day. he was thoroughly competent and a hard worker but he didn’t speak much outside of necessary talk for work. the officer noticed the sailor walked the length of the vessel every single day.  day after day this went on and every time the officer asked the sailor about it he only shook his head and gave a sad smile.   aside from being serious, the sailor was a hard worker and quickly became an expert in his job. every morning the ensign saw him walk the entire length of the vessel inspecting it and he often joined the other man. their first year flew by and at the end of it both men found themselves receiving promotions. they celebrated together by touring the sub and reminiscing about their first year in the navy. the sailor smiled fondly when the newly promoted lieutenant reminded him how excited they had been their first day and how new everything had seemed. again they finished their tour with a coffee before going about their evening.   it felt like their first full tour flew by as quickly as the first year had and through it all the sailor walked the submarine in his daily ritual. together the friends had toured the world, pulling into foreign ports and seen dozens of countries. finally, after three years they pulled back into king’s bay. it was good to be back in their home port. both men were promoted again.  and so the years went. every morning the sailor walked the entire length of the submarine. after a while the officer just accepted it as a weird tradition and most mornings he still joined in. both men were hard workers and competent and got promoted at regular intervals. by some strange twist of fate they were never transferred to a newer vessel. then one day the officer was promoted to captain on the same day as the sailor was promoted to master chief. the captain was given command of the submarine as the old captain retired. after the previous captain left, the two friends walked he submarine just like they had thousands of times before. they ended their tour with the now ritual cup of coffee. the captain commented on how much had changed over the years. the master chief just gave him a sad smile and quietly shook his head.  the two friends moved on to discuss their careers. they decided this would be their last tour. after more than 20 years in the navy they planned to retire. the last cruise flew by and soon they were pulling into king’s bay for the final time. they had maintained their daily walks together and the captain knew he would miss them when this was all over. they decided to hold their retirement ceremonies together on their beloved vessel and invited all their friends and former shipmates. the ceremony was a grand affair during which their former shipmates shared their favorite memories of the two men. many commented on their daily walks.  after ceremony was over they walked the length of the vessel one last time and met for one last cup of coffee before returning to their hometown. the captain looked at his old friend and said, “i have to know something. on our first day you here you were as excited as i was, but the second day you got serious and you haven’t ever seemed excited since. what happened?”  the master chief smiled his quiet smile and was silent for so long the captain worried he wouldn’t speak. but then he began, “every morning i go through this place from end to end looking and hoping. on that first day everything seemed so new. i made sure i saw everything. but on the second day i realized something: there’s nothing new on this sub.”	5

my neighbour used to sell ukranian eggs.  if you don't know what those are, it's when you draw on eggs with wax and then soak them in coloured dyes to create special designs. it's an art form called pysanky - you should look it up.     he used to sell them out of a little stall in his front garden. i never really saw many people buy them, but i figured it was just a hobby and didn't think too much about it. i once asked him what he did for a living.     "eggs," he said. "i sell ukranian eggs."     for context, he drove a fancy car, took long holidays to exotic places, and generally seemed to be quite well off, so i was pretty surprised to hear he made all his money off of selling little dyed eggs out of his garden. they must have fetched pretty high prices...     one day i got home and there were police all around my neighbour's house. they'd arrested him. turns out he'd been money laundering.     that egg stand? it was a shell corporation.	1

new woman joins a golf club. when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, "i played on my college's golf team. i was pretty good. mind if i join you next week?" no one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot. finally, one man says. "okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m." he figures the early tee-time will discourage her. the woman says this may be a problem, and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late. they roll their eyes, but say, "okay." she's there at 6:30 a.m. sharp, and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round. she's fun and pleasant, and the guys are impressed. they congratulate her and invite her back the next week. she smiles, and says, "i'll be there at 6:30 or 6:45." the next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp. only this time, she plays left-handed. the three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand. they're totally amazed. they can't figure her out. she's very pleasant and a gracious winner. they invite her back again, but each man harbours a burning desire to beat her. the third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys. this week she plays right-handed, and narrowly beats all three of them. the men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part. however, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge. this woman is a riddle no one can figure out. they have a couple of beers in the clubhouse, and finally, one of the men asks her, "how do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?" the lady blushes, and grins. "when my dad taught me to play golf, i learned i was ambidextrous," she replies. "i like to switch back and forth." "when i got married after college, i discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. from then on, i developed a silly habit. right before i leave in the morning for golf practice, i pull the covers off him. if his willie points to the right, i golf right-handed; if it points to the left, i golf left-handed." the guys think this is hysterical. astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, "what if it's pointing straight up?" she says, "then, i'm fifteen minutes late."	7

area 51 encounters a cessna. you've all heard ofthe air force's ultra-high-security,  super-secret base in nevada, known simply as "area 51?"   well, late one afternoon, the air force folks out at area 51 were very surprised to see a cessna landing at their "secret" base. they immediately impounded the aircraft and hauled the pilot into an interrogation room.  the pilot's story was that he took off from vegas, got lost, and spotted the base just as he was about to run out of fuel. the air force started a full fbi background check on the pilot and held him overnight during the investigation.  by the next day, they were finally convinced that the pilot really was lost and wasn't a spy.  they gassed up his airplane, gave him a terrifying  "you-did-not-see-a-base" briefing, complete with threats of spending the rest of his life in prison, told him vegas was that-a-way on such-and-such a heading, and sent him on his way.   the day after that though, to the total disbelief ofthe air force, the same cessna showed up again. once again, the mp's surrounded the plane... only this time there were two people in the plane. the same pilot jumped out and said, "do anything you want to me, but my wife is in the plane and you have to tell her where i  was last night!"   idk if this was posted here before, found this on another joke app.	1

challenge jar a man walks into a bar. he approaches the bartender to order his drink and can’t help but notice a huge glass jar packed to the brim with $100 bills.   so the man asks the bartender, “what’s the deal with that jar?”  the bartender replies, “that’s our challenge jar. you put $100 in and if you can complete the challenges you get all the money in the jar.”  intrigued, the man asks what the challenges are.   the bartender says, “well, first you have to eat a plate of 5 rotten eggs. second, there is a bear in the basement that has an abscess tooth. you’ll have to pull it. and finally, there’s a 90 year old lady upstairs who has never had an orgasm. you have to give her one.”  the man replies, “honestly, i was out at the rotten eggs. thanks though.”  so the man sits down and has a drink. then another. then another. and before long, he’s had enough liquid courage to tell the bartender, “you know what? screw it, i’ll go for it.”  so he places his $100 in the jar and the bartender brings out the eggs. they smell awful and taste even worse, but the man is drunk and there’s gotta be thousands in that jar, so he chokes them down.   “great,” says the bartender. “the bear is downstairs. good luck.”   so the man goes to the basement. everyone in the bar gathers at the door to hear what’s happening. it’s quiet at first, and the suddenly there’s a huge commotion. the bear is roaring, the man is screaming, glass is smashing, walls are breaking. it’s pandemonium down there.   after 10 minutes, the man opens the basement door. he’s covered in blood and his clothes are torn to shreds, but he’s still standing.   the bartender asks him, “are you okay?”  “yeah,” the man replies. “now where’s that old lady with the bad tooth?”	2

there was an old man who lived by a forest. as he grew older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald. that day, he called his children to a meeting he said, "look at my hair. it used to be so magnificent, but it's completely gone now. my hair can't be saved. but look outside at the forest. it's such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they'll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair."  "what i want you to do..." the man continued. "is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. tell your descendants to do the same. it shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong."  so they did.  each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.  and for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.	7

"see, sir? i've told you i'm educated."    a few weeks later the student returns a third time.

in celebration of my cake day, here's the worst joke i've ever created. there are two identical twin brothers that live together.  one happens to be a well-respected dentist, and the other can't seem to keep a job.  instead of actively looking for work, he likes to sit around at home.  one saturday, the dentist is hungry, and puts his brother on the spot.  he tells him to get off his lazy behind and go get them some food.  after some protest, the lazy brother takes the car and leaves for the store.  in the meantime, the dentist takes a nap on his day off.  he turns off his phone so he won't be interrupted.        about 30 minutes later, the lazy brother gets into a head-on collision in the intersection by the grocery store.  his vital signs are fading; he's unconscious and barely moving.  an ambulance picks him up and rushes him to the hospital.  he ends up in the emergency room under observation, but his condition is critical.  they try calling his dentist brother, but he doesn't pick up because his phone is off.        the dentist wakes to a knock on the door.  suspecting a solicitor, he ignores it, but the knocking continues.  eventually, he resolves to get up and yell at the person at the door.  when he does, he reveals--- the grim reaper.  he is just as he appears in movies; a full skeleton underneath a tattered cloak.        the grim reaper swears.  "oh no!  this always happens with identical twins".        "what do you mean?"  asks the dentist.      "well... if you must know, your brother was in a critical car accident, and i've come to take him to the underworld.  i'm afraid his time on earth has ended.  i'll take my leave now."        the dentist is noticeably upset.  he says "wait!  isn't there some way i can challenge you for my brother's life?  after all, you made the mistake.  certainly there must be a way i can bargain for his life."        the grim reaper asks "what do you have in mind?"        the dentist thinks.  "how about a challenge?  if i beat you, you let my brother go free."        the grim reaper laughs.  "i will beat you in any challenge.  what challenge do you propose?"        the dentist smiles.  "i propose we see who has the cleanest teeth.  5 minute of brushing each, then we decide."        "very well" says the grim reaper, who makes his way to the bathroom.        once there, he pulls back his tattered cloak to reveal his skull.  it's glistening.  he takes a toothbrush from the bathroom, loads it with toothpaste, and brushes.  after 5 minutes, the shiniest teeth anyone has ever seen glisten and make the room bright.  the grim reaper grins.  "you are foolish human.  but, you are entitled to your chance."      the dentist takes another toothbrush, loads it with toothpaste, and starts brushing like a madman.  when his 5 minutes are up, he spits out the paste.  he smiles.        it's unbelievable.        the shine from the dentist's teeth is so beautiful that he can see the grim reaper's reflection in his perfectly clean teeth.        the winner is obvious.  the grim reaper hangs his head in shame.  "you win, human.  this time.  your brother will live."  he disappears in a puff of smoke.  at the same instant, the bed-ridden brother wakes up in the hospital.  not only is he uninjured, he seems perfectly healthy.  suddenly, the phone by his bed rings.  it's his brother, the dentist.  he picks up.  "hey bro.  you'll never believe what happened.  apparently, i went out to the market and got hit by a car.  they say i almost died."        the dentist smiles on the phone and says.  "that's interesting, bro.  today you might say that i also had a brush with death."	7

"if the only way i can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do i become a monk?"  the monks reply, "you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles, when you find these numbers, you will become a monk." the man sets about his task. some 54 years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery.  he says," i have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. there are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth".  the monks reply, "congratulations. you are now a monk. we shall now show you the way to the sound".  the monks lead the man to a wooden door where the head monk says, "the sound is right behind that door". the man reaches for the knob, but the door is locked.  he says, "real funny. may i have the key?" the monks give him the key, and he opens the door. behind the wooden door is another door made of stone.  the man demands the key to the stone door. the monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. he demands another key from the monks, who provide it.  behind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire, and so it went until the man had gone through doors of emerald, silver, topaz, and amethyst.  finally, the monks say, "this is the last key to the last door".  the man is relieved to know that he has finally reached to the end.  he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is amazed to find the source of that strange sound.  but he can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.	8

great coffee this elderly lady went to the doctor for a check-up.  everything checked out fine. the old lady pulled the doctor to the side and said, ”doctor, i haven’t had sex for years now and i was wondering how i can increase my husband’s sex drive.”  the doctor smiled and said, ”have you tried to give him viagra?” the lady frowned. ”doctor, i can’t even get him to take aspirin when he has a headache,” she claimed. ”well,” the doctor continued, ”let me suggest something. crush the viagra into a powder. when you are giving him coffee, stir it into the coffee and serve it. he won’t notice a thing.” the old lady was delighted.  she left the doctor’s office quickly.  weeks later the old lady returned.  she was frowning and the doctor asked her what was wrong. she shook her head.  ”how did it go?” the doctor asked. ”terrible, doctor, terrible.” ”did it not work?” ”yes,” the old lady said, ”it worked. i did as you said and he got up and ripped his clothes off right then and there and we made mad love on the table. it was the best sex that i’d had in 25 years.” ”then what is the problem, ma’am?” ”well,” she said. ”i can’t ever show my face in mcdonald’s again.	6

a mathematician and a physicist... ... are invited to participate in a psychological experiment.  the first one is the mathematician.  he is guided into a room where his wife sits on a chair, only wearing lingerie, looking at him with lust and desire. the surprised mathematician is placed on a chair a few meters away.  the instructor: "so your wife has consented to participate in this experiment. every 30 seconds, this robot will divide the distance between your chairs in two, so that you'll come closer to each other. we won't be watching what you do to each other, just observe your heart rate and breathing.  but under no circumstances can you leave your chairs! are you ready?"  the mathematician, instantly grasping the consequences of the repeated division by two, shouts at the instructor: " you monsters! you know i'll never reach her!" and thus he storms out of the lab.  after writing a few notes on his clipboard, the instructor leads the physicist into the room with his wife, explains the experiment and asks him "are you ready?"   the physicist, happy and enthusiastic, places himself on the chair and looks at the instructor "let's do this!"  "sir, are you aware of the fact that you will never actually reach her?"  "of course! but i'll get close enough to do all my planned experiments!"	2

there's this kid named tommy. he has no body. he is just a head. tommy was born without a body or any limbs, so his entire life he has existed as a head only-- he learned to roll around, use his mouth to maneuver things, and live just like a normal kid.   one day tommy rolled into school just like any other day, banged against his locker to open it, started to get his books when, all of a sudden, he spots a new student.  tommy thinks she's absolutely beautiful. her hair is perfect, her body is amazing (which tommy slightly envied, but had gotten over those thoughts mostly by now), and she had an amazing sense of fashion. there was just one thing off about this girl though; she only had one eye, and in place of her other eye was a prosthetic eye made of wood. it didn't even look like a real eye, it just looked wooden.  tommy saw her and his jaw dropped to the floor-- "what's her name?" he asked a friend.  "oh, her? that's sally, the girl with a wooden eye."  tommy saw past her wooden eye and was starstruck ever since he first laid eyes on sally. he made it his mission to ask sally to prom.  weeks later, tommy finally gathered the courage to ask his crush the big question. he rolled up to her in the cafeteria and said, "hey sally, i'm tommy. i was wondering if you wanted to go to prom with me?"  sally looked down at him for a second, and said, " uhmm.. i'm sorry tommy.. i don't think so."  this devastated tommy. he had felt all sorts of pain and denial in his life from not having a body. he knew what rejection and denial felt like having been left out of all the activities full bodied people could do. but nothing hurt quite as much as this. his heart was shattered. and then tommy turned into a grape.  so now tommy is a grape, just rolling around school, and he is depressed like never before. people see tommy and notice that something is off with him. he's so depressed, that he turned into a grape.  sally sees this and begins to feel really bad. "was i too harsh?" she asked a friend, " maybe i should go try to make it up to him." now sally made it her mission to ask tommy to the prom, and hopefully he would return to normal.  after school, sally went by tommy's house and knocked on the door. tommy answered, and she was surprised for a second that a grape could answer the door-- but nonetheless, she moved forward with her mission.  "tommy, i wanted to ask you something... would you go to prom with me?"  tommy didn't believe his ears for a second-- the most beautiful girl he had ever seen had just asked him to the prom! without thinking, he replied,  "oh wood eye, wood eye!"  sally was offended and crushed him.  the moral of the story: stop while you're a head.	8

i see your non-offensive joke about jews, and make my own humble contribution for cultural context, this joke was originally told to me in russian while i lived in ukraine... and please bear with me on the translation  an old rabbi was lying on his deathbed, and called out for the nurse to come near. she hurried over and asked what he needed. "fetch me a representative of the communist party as quickly as you can!" a bit surprised, the nurse did as she was asked and found a campaign manager from the communist party. the old rabbi explained that he wanted to join the communist party, much to the campaign managers surprise. "well all it takes is a bit of paperwork and you will be registered!" said the manager. he excitedly assisted the old rabbi to fulfill his dying wish. the communist was still a bit puzzled as to why a jew would want to join the communist party, but was really excited about how much good publicity it would make for a jewish rabbi to announce that he had joined them. "may i ask, why a jew would join the communist party on his deathbed?" to which the old rabbi exclaimed; "because it means today, another communist will die!"	7

the caretaker of a generation ship was on his death bed many years before, jacques had helped place all his friends and family into cryogenic sleep. he was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. they said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.  in the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. he formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. he would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. he didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. but a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.  with his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. something that looked real. something that felt real. something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away. he didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. by the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of jacques himself. he named the robot jacques 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? and as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.  well, years passed as they are wont to do. he grew old and frail on the journey, but jacques 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.  as the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. he wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. he did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. so when the day finally came, jacques 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.  but the journey was not over. jacques 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. as the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. one by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. when they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. there was jacques, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.  “how can this be?” they asked. “surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. it has been so long since we left earth.” jacques 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “do not worry. i am here to send you a message of love and care from jacques. i was created to help him complete his mission. i may look like him, but in truth, i am not him. for you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real jacques is in the comets.”	6

six lessons of life **lesson 1:**  a man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. the wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. when she opens the door, there stands bob, the next door neighbour. before she says a word, bob says, “i’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” after thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of bob.  after a few seconds, bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. the woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. when she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…  “who was that?” “it was bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “great!” the husband says, “did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”  *moral of the story:*  if you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.  &nbsp;  **lesson 2:**  a sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. they rub it and a genie comes out. the genie says, “i’ll give each of you just one wish” “me first! me first!” says the administration clerk. “i want to be in the bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” poof! she’s gone. “me next! me next!” says the sales rep. “i want to be in hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of pina coladas and the love of my life.” poof! he’s gone. “ok, you’re up,” the genie says to the manager. the manager says, “i want those two back in the office after lunch.”  *moral of the story:*  always let your boss have the first say  &nbsp;  **lesson 3:**  a priest offered a lift to a nun. she got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. the priest nearly had an accident. after controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. the nun said,”father, remember psalm 129?” the priest removed his hand. but, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. the nun once again said, “father, remember psalm 129?” the priest apologized “sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. on his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up psalm 129. it said, “go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”  *moral of the story:*  if you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity  &nbsp;  **lesson 4**  a crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. a rabbit asked him, ”can i also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” the crow answered: “sure, why not.” so, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.  a fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.  *moral of the story:*  to be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up  &nbsp;  **lesson 5:**  power of charisma  a turkey was chatting with a bull “i would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but i haven’t got the energy.” “well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “they’re packed with nutrients.” the turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. the next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.  *moral of the story:*  bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there  &nbsp;  **lesson 6**  a little bird was flying south for the winter. it was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. while he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. as the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. the dung was actually thawing him out! he lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. a passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.  *moral of the story:*  1. not everyone who shits on you is your enemy  2. not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend  3. and when you’re in deep shit, it’s best to keep your mouth shut!	8

on her wedding day, the mother of the bride has a talk with her daughter. "sweetheart," says she, "your husband-to-be is a great catch.  handsome, kind, and rich.  but he's greek.  and you need to know something about greek men in the bedroom.  there will come a day, maybe soon maybe not, but the time will come when, during intimacy, he'll ask you to "roll over."  when that happens, don't say another word to him.  just come straight home to me."  the daughter promises that she will do as her mother asks.  but she's nervous about it.  the wedding goes forward without a hitch, and so does the honeymoon.  the couple gets on fabulously together, in the bedroom and out.  when they get home, the marital bliss continues, and the young bride discovers that she has quite a sex drive.  she initiates sex even more frequently than her husband.  and the bride's mother's warning never becomes relevant.  on the couple's first anniversary, they have a fantastic, romantic night out.  and when they get home, the have sex for a solid three hours straight.  after all that, the husband leans over and whispers in his wife's ear "honey, roll over for me."    the woman bursts into hysterical tears.  she jumps out of bed, and begins to pack her bags.  "i'm going home to my mother," she wails.  "honey, what's wrong," her husband begs.  "let me fix it," he says.  "my mother warned me about yiu on our wedding day!  she told me that one day you would ask me to "roll over."  "of course, darling," the man replies.  "but don't you ever want to have a baby???"	8

a young lady walks into a pet store to buy a parrot the guy behind the counter says that he only has one and that it's a real smart-ass, with a vulgar vocabulary and a rude temperament.  the woman says that's ok i know how to handle assholes like that, i want the parrot anyway.  so the woman gets the bird home, puts it in her room, and starts to get ready for bed. just as she gets her slacks off the parrot says: "awk... nice legs baby!" well the the woman isn't gonna take this shit so she takes the bird out of the cage and puts it in the freezer for 3 minutes.  while the parrots in the freezer, he becomes real sure that this was the wrong thing to say, and is making a large mental note about saying that again.  the next night, again the woman is getting ready for bed this time the parrot knows not to say any thing about her legs, but after she removes her blouse, and then her bra... the parrot just can't resist any longer. he blurts out "awk... great tits baby lets see ya shake em!".  this once again gets the woman pissed-off and she decides that instead of 3 minutes in the freezer, she is going to keep the parrot in for 5 minutes.  well the parrot has had *lots* of time to think this time, and remorse gives way to desperation, and finally to anger so that the adrenaline will allow him to continue to live.  finally the woman opens the freezer door, takes out the near frozen parrot and asks... "well, have you learned your lesson?"  the parrot still shivering and barely able to speak says... "awk... yeah yeah sure sure, but i just have one question....."  the woman says... "yes?"  the parrot says "awk... what did the turkey do, ask for a blow job?"	5

"that's right!" the third daughter hooted. "you will pay for this grievous insult to my honor!"  "shut up!" her father shouted. "i'm trying to give the man his change!"	5

a recently married couple... ... just purchased their first place together.  it was a beautiful apartment in a high rise with a balcony on the kitchen overlooking the park.  one day, the husband comes home from work early to surprise his wife.  but to his surprise he finds her naked in bed.    enraged, he shouts "where is he?" to which his wife replies "i don't know what you are talking about!" the husband begins searching furiously for his wife's lover.  he looks under the bed, in the closets, behind drapes, everywhere a person could be hiding with no luck.  frustrated, he steps out onto the kitchen balcony to have a cigarette.  while lighting the cigarette, he notices fingers holding onto the balcony.  the husband, realizing his opportunity to quickly end the man who was sleeping with his wife, stomps on his fingers and the man falls two stories into a tree which saved him from death.  the husband saw the man moving on the ground and immediately went into the kitchen, unplugged the fridge, pushed it out onto the balcony and over the railing.  crashing through the tree, the fridge lands square on the man and crushes him dead.   in front of st. peter at the gates of heaven stands three men.  st. peter says to the first "welcome to heaven, please state the manner of death and then you may proceed."   the first man says "well, i came home from work early one day and caught my wife having an affair.  the clever fuck hid by hanging from my balcony.  i found him and sent him falling to the ground.  unfortunately, he did not die, so i pushed the fridge over the rail to crush him and while doing so had a heart attack and died."   st. peter says "i'm sorry to hear that tragic end, welcome to heaven."   the second man approaches and explains "i was working out on my balcony when i lifted too much weight and lost my balance and fell over the railing.  luckily, i was able to catch onto the balcony below and save my life.  but then some lunatic stomped on my fingers and i fell to the ground!  fortunately, several tree branches slowed me down and i survived.  but then a fridge came out of nowhere and crushed me!"   st. peter says "oh my, what a terrible day.  welcome to heaven!"   the third man approaches and explains "you see st. peter, i was fucking this guy's wife and he came home from work early, so i hid in the fridge."	7

big jake it's a quiet day in the salloon when a cowboy runs in. with a panicked look on his face, he says, "everybody run, i just got word that big jake is comin' to town!".  the bartender, who's new in town, is shocked to see everybody get up and run out. he grabs a patron by the bar and asks, "what' happening?".  "d-d-didn't you hear, man? big jake's comin' to town!"  the bartender is confused, but rolls with it. but, since he doesn't want people coming and looting the salloon, he decides to stick around.  just then, the meanest, tallest, ugliest son-of-a-bitch the bartender's ever seen bursts into the room. he slams the door so hard it falls clean off its hinges. he's eight foot tall, and nearly as wide. every inch of his face is either scarred or tattooed. his ears are pierced with two massive railroad spikes. he picks up a table and throws it straight down through the floor, just to show that he can.  he walks up to the bar and slams his fist down on it so hard that it splits clean in two. "**hey, barkeep!**", he yells. "**gimme that bottle o' whiskey!**"  shaking, the barkeeper hands the bottle over. in one massive gulp, he downs the entire bottle before smashing it over his own head. "**now gimme that bottle o' tequilla!**"  again, the barkeeper hands over the bottle, which the stranger downs in a single gulp before breaking the bottle over his head. he scoops up some of the glass and eats it, just to show how tough he is.  wanting to stay on his good side, the bartender asks him, "i-i-is there anything else i can get you, sir?".  the stranger says "**thanks pardner, but i gots to get the hell out of here, fast! i heard that big jake's comin' to town!**"	1

a wise old gentleman retired... ...and purchased a modest home near a junior high school. he spent the first few weeks of his retirement in peace and contentment. then a new school year began.   the very next afternoon three young boys, full of youthful, after-school enthusiasm, came down his street, beating merrily on every trash can they encountered. the crashing percussion continued day after day, until finally the wise old man decided it was time to take some action. the next afternoon, he walked out to meet the young percussionists as they banged their way down the street.   stopping them, he said, "you kids are a lot of fun. i like to see you express your exuberance like that. in fact, i used to do the same thing when i was your age. will you do me a favor? i'll give you each a dollar if you'll promise to come around every day and do your thing."   the kids were elated and continued to do a bang-up job on the trash cans. after a few days, the old-timer greeted the kids again, but this time he had a sad smile on his face. "this recession's really putting a big dent in my income," he told them. "from now on, i'll only be able to pay you 50 cents to beat on the cans."   the noisemakers were obviously displeased, but they did accept his offer and continued their afternoon ruckus. a few days later, the retiree approached them again as they drummed their way down the street.   "look," he said, "i haven't received my social security check yet, so i'm not going to be able to give you more than 25 cents. will that be okay?"   "a lousy quarter?" the drum leader exclaimed. "if you think we're going to waste our time, beating these cans around for a quarter, you're nuts! no way, mister. we quit!"	2

meanwhile at the airport... jimmy and jason are both workers at the atlanta airport, typically working outside to re-fuel the planes after they land.  one day, a very thick fog rolls in grounding all of the planes.  jimmy and jason are bored out of their minds with nothing to do.  "i'm really bored," says jimmy.  "i wish we could get drunk or something."  "we can," responds jason.  "did you know that if you drink jet fuel, it will get you fucked up like regular booze."  "yeah?" asked jimmy.  "and the best part," continued jason, "is that there are no aftereffects.  no hangover or nuthin."  "well, shit," exclaims jimmy, pour me a drink.  so our two heroes spend the night getting absolutely hammered on jet fuel to the point of blacking out.  the next morning, jimmy wakes up.  he raises his head from the pillow expecting the worst.  surprisingly he feels perfect!  no hangover, nausea, nothing.  he gets up and takes a few steps and doesn't even feel lightheaded.  he is shocked.  suddenly his cell phone rings and it is jason.  he picks it up.   "hey man, this is amazing.  i feel great.  i can't believe how much jet fuel we drank last night, but i feel awesome!  that stuff is amazing!"  "that's great," responds jason.  "look, there's something i need to tell you."  "yeah," responds jimmy.  "whatever you do, don't fart!  i'm in cleveland!"	5

a policeman was interrogating 3 guys who were training to become detectives. to test their skills in recognizing a suspect, he shows the first guys a picture for 5 seconds and then hides it. "this is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"   the first guy answers, "that's easy, we'll catch him fast because he only has one eye!"   the policeman says, "well...uh...that's because the picture i showed is his side profile."  slightly flustered by this ridiculous response, he flashes the picture for 5 seconds at the second guy and asks him, "this is your suspect, how would you recognize him?"  the second guy smiles, flips his hair and says, "ha! he'd be too easy to catch because he only has one ear!"  the policeman angrily responds, "what's the matter with you two?!!? of course only one eye and one ear are showing because it's a picture of his side profile! is that the best answer you can come up with?"  extremely frustrated at this point, he shows the picture to the third guy and in a very testy voice asks, "this is your suspect, how would you recognize him?   he quickly adds, "think hard before giving me a stupid answer."  the third guy looks at the picture intently for a moment and says, "the suspect wears contact lenses."  the policeman is surprised and speechless because he really doesn't know himself if the suspect wears contacts or not.  "well, that's an interesting answer. wait here for a few minutes while i check his file and i'll get back to you on that."   he leaves the room and goes to his office, checks the suspect's file on his computer and comes back with a beaming smile on his face.  "wow! i can't believe it. it's true! the suspect does, in fact, wear contact lenses. good work! how were you able to make such an astute observation?"  "that's easy..." the third guy replied. "he can't wear regular glasses because he only has one eye and one ear."	8

"3 for one, 10 for three!", the boy said innocently. flabbergasted, the man thought to himself, "3 times 3 is 9, why would he sell for 10?"  "how many, sir?", the boy asked. "i'll take one. here's your 3 coins." the boy smiled and handed him a mango. "or how about another? here, 3 coins." the boy smiled again. "these really look delicious. one more please. have your 3 coins." the man smiled wide.    "hah! you've been cheated! i just got 3 for 9, while you priced 10!"   the boy, smiling wider said, "and i, sir, made you buy 3 mangoes for no reason at all."	4

"well... that doesn't seem fai- "  "-we can let this go to trial, you can spend thousands on lawyers, but if ms. johnson's attorneys can prove calling her a 'pig' leads to emotional damage, you'll end up owing a lot."  dave paused. "ok, fine. can i call a pig 'ms. johnson'?"  the judge looked over his notes. "yes... you may call a pig 'ms. johnson' without fear of legal recourse."  dave turned to peggy and said "good afternoon, ms. johnson."	8

[long] my company is locked down and i am required to work from home i'm used to working in an open office space so this is a huge change for me. in order to make the transition as easy as possible, i have prepared my home office so remind me of work.  * i've purchased a piece of limburger cheese and placed it on a plate in the middle of the room to remind me of the smell of certain colleagues i'm now prevented from seeing. * i've placed a few pieces of cardbord in all window panes in order to produce a draft. * i've purchased ten portable radios and tuned them to different talk radio channels, adjusting the volume to slightly above normal conversation volume. at least one radio channel host has a loud and penetrating laughter. half of the channels are allowed some professional content, but no more. * i've had automatic blinds installed but asked the installer to reverse the motor so the blinds go up when the sun shines through my window and down when it gets cloudy. * i found a handful of old mobile phones and installed some loud and distinctive ring tones that i found online. i've agreed with my colleagues that they call them a few times per hour, avoiding the temptation to answer them until my colleagues hang up--like in the office. * for a proper coffee experience, i brew my coffee the day before. whenever i need a cup of coffee, i reheat the entire bottle in the microwave and pour myself a cup. * i have purchased both a cooling unit and a heating unit. they are adjusted so that the cooling unit engages at two degrees higher than the heating unit disenages. it is important for them to thus compete against each other, becaues otherwise i won't get a lifelike simulation of the hvac system in our office. * i have replaced all of my office plants with wax plants--you know, those plants that are typically arranged in a upright torus and bark covering the soil. they require minimal maintenance, and require only some cuts and adjustments every now and then, thus being treated much like all other life in the office. * whenever i begin working on a task, i start an egg timer so that it takes no more than 23 minutes before i get interrupted. * i've invested in an electrically adjustable desk. i realize that only few people actually make use of this feature but it sends an important message about the company's concern for the well-being of its employees. if your have no pain in your back, then everything is fine. * i remove all of my personal items, pc connections, etc. from my desk every affternoon, because although i intend to use them all the next morning, i must be reminded that i can never know where i will be placed on the next work day. * i've printed a number of us letter-sized sheets with text and accompanying stikc men (m/f, of course) that communicate how to be considerate of your employees. this is exclusively to set a proper atmosphere because just like in the office, no-one follows the recommendations. * i have installed an additional dhcp server on my home network in order to get ip address conflicts. * it will be expensive, but at least once a week i'll be hiring a construction team to perform noisy work.	6

a young aristocratic woman pulls up to a large new york bank in her rolls royce. she parks in front of the bank and goes inside where she is greeted by a banker.   "hi, sir. i would like to take out a loan using my rolls royce as collateral" the woman says to the banker.   "yes ma'am. how much money will you need to borrow?" he asks.  "$500.00 please" says the woman.    "ma'am, that car is easily worth $200,000! are you certain you only want $500?".   she reassures him that is all she needs and she will be back in 30 days to pay the loan balance plus interest in full.   the banker can't believe it, but he writes up the paperwork, has her sign and gives the woman her money. he then orders security to move the car down to the vault where it can be safely stored as collateral. he laughs with his co-worker about how much of a idiot this woman is!  30 days later the woman returns to the bank with $534.00, the amount of the loan plus one month interest, just as she promised.   as the banker is waiting on the car to be brought up, he can't help but ask the woman why she used her $200,000 car on a $500 loan.   she replied "i didn't need the $500 but i was leaving the country for a month and needed a secure place to store my car. $34 is way cheaper than anywhere else in new york."	7
