abbott & costello costello: i want to talk about the unemployment rate in america .   abbott: good subject. terrible times. it's 7.8%.   costello: that many people are out of work?   abbott: no, that's 14.7%   costello: you just said 7.8%.  abbott: 7.8% unemployed.   costello: right 7.8% out of work.   abbott: no, that's 14.7%.   costello: okay, so it's 14.7% unemployed.  abbott: no, that's 7.8%.   costello: wait a minute. is it 7.8% or 14.7%?   abbott: 7.8% are unemployed. 14.7% are out of work.   costello: if you are out of work you are unemployed.   abbott: no, congress said you can't count the "out of work" as the unemployed. you have to look for work to be unemployed.  costello: but they are out of work!!!   abbott: no, you miss his point.  costello: what point?   abbott: someone who doesn't look for work can't be counted with those who look for work. it wouldn't be fair.   costello: to whom?  abbott: the unemployed.   costello: but all of them are out of work.   abbott: no, the unemployed are actively looking for work. those who are out of work gave up looking and if you give up, you are no longer in the ranks of the unemployed.   costello: so if you're off the unemployment rolls that would count as less unemployment?   abbott: unemployment would go down. absolutely!  costello: the unemployment just goes down because you don't look for work?   abbott: absolutely it goes down. that's how they get it to 7.8%. otherwise it would be 14.7%. our govt. doesn't want you to read about 14.7% unemployment.  costello: that would be tough on those running for reelection.   abbott: absolutely!  costello: wait, i got a question for you. that means there are two ways to bring down the unemployment number?   abbott: two ways is correct.   costello: unemployment can go down if someone gets a job?   abbott: correct.   costello: and unemployment can also go down if you stop looking for a job?   abbott: bingo.  costello: so there are two ways to bring unemployment down, and the easier of the two is to have people stop looking for work.   abbott: now you're thinking like an economist.   costello: i don't even know what the hell i just said!	2

ladder to success a man died and went to heaven. as he entered through the pearly gates he saw a beautiful woman sitting under a tree. she smiled at him and said, "come to my arms and make love to me". as the man happily approached her he saw a ladder going up through the skies.  "what is that?", the man asked.  the beautiful woman replied, "oh if you didn't want me you could use it. that's the ladder to success"  the man thought maybe even greater things were awaiting him at the end of that ladder and he climbed up.   he reached another layer of the heaven and saw two beautiful, naked women lying on the grass. on seeing him they said, "please, please come to us and make love to us forever".  but the man noticed another ladder going up from where the women were lying.   "what is that, again?", the man asked.  the beautiful women replied, "oh well,  if you didn't want us you could use it. that's the ladder to success"  the man even more curious and started climbing and found himself in a beautiful garden full of voluptuous naked women, all begging him to make love to them. but again, he saw another ladder going up.   "is this the ladder to success?" the man asked.  "yes", replied the women.  the man ran to the ladder and started climbing. as soon as he reached the top he saw a huge naked, ugly monster, weighing at least  500 pounds staring at him with a smile.  "finally you have come" - the monster said.  "who...who are you?" said the  man, extremely scared.  "i am cess" - replied the monster !!!!	3

three men died and went to hell  three men died and went to hell where they met the devil. the devil told them that they had sinned in life and therefore had to spend the next 1000 years in hell to atone for their sins. however, since the devil wasn't entirely merciless, he would let them choose for themselves how they were going to spend those 1000 years. and so the devil let the men to three doors.  going through the first door, they entered what looked to be a normal bar. although, if you were there for more than an hour, you would notice that no matter how much you tried to drink another bottle would appear on the shelf. and even better, the bar always had the exact drink you wanted available.  an unlimited supply of every alcoholic beverage in existence. it was, in short, a drunkard's paradise.  when they entered the second door, they were greeted by a myriad of women all ready to satisfy every sexual desire they could possible have. there were multiple women of every shape, size and ethnicity imaginable. looking closer you would notice that there were even celebrity and work crushes from your life in the crowd. every single one of them ready  to please you. it was, in short, a pervert's paradise  finally, when they entered the third door, they found themselves in a forest made of cannabis. the ground was made of kief, all the bushes wore beatiful buds and even the trees were 20 feet tall cannabis plants. there were every strain it has or ever will be possible to grow. you could even find rocks of hashish laying around the forest floor if you looked closely. it was, in short, a stoner's paradise.  the devil asked the men which room they each wanted. the words had barely left the devil's mouth before the first man ran directly to the room with a myriad of women. the second man then went to the room with the bar, thinking that if he was going to spend 666 years in hell, he might as well be drunk for most of it. lastly, the third man, thinking he had won the lottery, gladly went towards the room with the forest of cannabis.   1000 years later, the devil returned to see if the men had atoned for their sins.  when he opened the first door, bottles slowly rolled out and you could immediately smell piss and puke coming from the room. it took the devil a while, but he finally found the man nestled between the bottles, smeared in his own shit and puke, and with arguably the worst hangover in history. the devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.  when he opened the second door, he was overwhelmed with the sound of hundreds of crying children and angry women. not ten seconds after the door opened, the man came running, pleading for the devil to please let him out. there were kids of every age running around screaming and all the women were angry at each other, while everyone, children and mothers alike, were angry at the man. the devil agreed it was punishment enough and let him out.  when the devil opened the third door, he immediately saw the man sitting cross legged in a giant pool of his own tears. the devil had not expected this. confused, he went to ask the man what was wrong. the man, tears still running down his face, looked up at the devil and said:  "hey man, you got a lighter?”	3

a man and a dog, and the extremely unusual funeral... a man and his wife are walking down the town main street. they are arguing, as they always do, about the efficiency of wearing masks during the pandemic.  however, they have to stop because of a funeral procession that is actively going on. the procession was extremely unusual... everyone is walking, the first family are carrying a very nice mahogany wood casket, then about 10 yards behind there is a second group carrying a second wooden casket, cheaper wood this time, but it's two caskets there... after the second casket a solitary, sad man is walking with his dog.  however, after the man there are about 500 people, oddly all walking in a straight line right behind the man...  the man who was arguing with his wife, stops arguing and decides to approach the man, with a lot of respect he decides to ask about this very unusual funeral... so he approaches the man with the lovely looking dog.  man: excuse me, i know this is not best moment to ask, but i have never seen a funeral like this... who is this funeral for?  man with dog: i understand, well my wife is in the first casket...  man: so sorry to hear, may i ask what happened to her?  man with dog: my dog attacked her, and killed her.  \\*they both keep walking a bit, but the man asks...  man: so who is in the second casket?  man with dog: my mother in law....  man: oh wow... i am so sorry to hear... what happened to her?  man with dog: well, she was trying to help my wife, and the dog turned against her and killed her as well...  man (after a brief pause, thinking hard...): sir, may i borrow your dog for a day?  man with dog: to the back of the line!	4

a man wants to go horseback riding when the man gets to the ranch, he asks the owner if he can ride of the horses. the owner replies “looks like we have one horse you can ride, however this horse is a little different than our other horses”.  the man asks “how so?”  “this horse is religious. i ride this horse to church, it listens to the scripture, and i’m pretty sure it prays when i’m not around. unlike normal horses, it only starts moving when you say ‘thank god’”.  the man replies, “okay, i haven’t ridden many horses, but that isn’t a problem”. he hops on the horse and says “thank god?” and the horse starts galloping.  the horse is going at a slow pace and he says again ‘thank god’ and the horse goes a little faster. after a minute he says ‘thank god’ again and goes even faster. the man gets the hang of it and repeats until the horse is running at full speed.   as the horse is going at quick speed the man figures this wasn’t that hard. as the horse continues, he notices the end of a cliff ahead. he tried to have the horse change direction, but it keeps going straight. he tries to get the horse to slow down. he pulls on the reins, but the horse continues. he yell “woah woah” and “stop” but the horse is still running full speed.   the edge is getting closer and the man starts yelling every religious phrase he can think of. “hallelujah”, “praise god”, “jesus saves”, nothing happens. he screams “amen”, and the horse stops. the man realizes he was just feet from running off the cliff and signs a breath of relief and said “oh thank god”.	4

three explorers: one from england, one from france, and one from new york went into the jungle... one day on their journey a group of native tribesmen found and captured them. after being taken to the camp of these natives, the explorers were brought to the chief of the tribe.   he told the explorers. "for trespassing on land sacred to our people, you are to be killed and your skins turned into boats for travel across the waters. however, as a sign of respect i will let each of you choose the way you shall die so you may have some shred of dignity in death."  the three explorers were given a few minutes to decide before they each asked the chief for what they wanted to use to kill themselves.  the englishman asked for a gun.  the frenchman asked for a glass of poison.  the new yorker asked for a fork.  first, the englishman took the gun, said "god save the queen." then shot himself in the head.  second, the frenchman took the glass of poison, said "viva la france." then drank the glass and fell dead.  lastly, the new yorker took the fork, and started stabbing himself repeatedly over and over in the stomach and said.

a priest was about to finish his tour of duty, and was leaving his mission in the jungle after spending years teaching the natives. suddenly he realized that the one thing he never taught them was how to speak english. so he takes the chief for a walk in the forest. he points to a tree and says to the chief, "this is a tree." the chief looks at the tree and grunts, "tree." the priest is pleased with the response.  they walk a little further and he points to a rock and says, "this is a rock." hearing this, the chief looks and grunts, "rock." the priest was really getting enthusiastic about the results when he hears a rustling in the bushes. as they peek over the top, he sees a couple of natives in the midst of heavy sexual activity.  the priest is really flustered and quickly responds, "man riding a bike." the chief looks at the couple briefly, pulls out his blowgun and kills them.  the priest goes ballistic and yells at the chief that he has spent years teaching them how to be civilized and be kind to each other, so how could he kill these people in cold blood that way? the chief replied, "my bike."	4

a joke that works best when told aloud: the chicken in the library. a chicken walks into a library, goes up to the librarian, and squawks: "book!"  once the librarian has gotten over the confusion of having a chicken in a library, she wonders whether or not the chicken actually wanted a book. she eventually figures that she might as well humour the chicken's request. if it doesn't know what it's asking for, it won't complain, so why not assume it does? she brings over a book, and as she suspected, the chicken grabs it with its beak and drags it out of the library.  the next day, to her surprise, there's a chicken again. it's the same one. it orders: "book, book!" in equal parts amused and bewildered, the librarian complies with the request, giving it two books, which it drags out of the library as before. the same happens the next day. the chicken comes in and orders: "book, book, book!" the librarian gives it three books, and it drags them off.  this continues, day by day, until the chicken is ordering dozens of books at a time. the librarian is confused and concerned - why is this chicken independently ordering books and not bringing them back? so she decides to close up for the day and follow the chicken to wherever it's going. she has to follow at a safe distance - which lengthens her journey considerably because, of course, a chicken dragging a bag of 25 books is going to be very slow-moving.  eventually she tracks the chicken to a pond. oh no, she thinks, the chicken is throwing the books into the pond. this is just like that goose. but no. the chicken calls, and a frog hops out of the water. the chicken presents the books to the frog, one by one...  and the frog says, each time: "read-it. read-it. read-it."	3

two whales a male and a female whale were swimming along the coast of japan and noticed a whaling ship not too far from them.   the male whale gets angry at the sight of the ship because his father was killed by whalers a few years ago.  he decides that he wants payback.  he turns to the female whale and asks her, "hey, you know how these whalers keep murdering our friends and family right?"   the female whale nods in agreement.   so the male whale continues, "how bout we teach those whalers lesson then?"  to which the female whale replies, "sure, what did you have in mind?"  upon hearing her agreement, a devilish gleam can be seen in his eyes as he explains his plan.   "let's swim deep down under the sea where they can't see us. then we'll emerge right under their ship and use our blow holes to capsize it. "  the female whale agrees, and they immediately spring into action. they both dive down deeper into the ocean and go completely unnoticed by the whalers.  then, slowly and meticulously, they emerge right under the ship. they then both blow as hard as they can out of their blow holes the combined air pressure topples the ship.   the whales both swim away, elated and laughing at their success with both whales yelling "yeah that'll teach them a lesson about killing whales!"  as the male whale looks back to admire the chaos they created, he notices the ship's crew swimming back to shore.  this gives him an idea and a devilish smile runs across his face as he turns to ask the female whale,   "do you know what would really teach those whalers a lesson about killing whales?  why don't we swim right up to them and gobble them all up?   to which the female whale shakes her head in disagreement and replies, "look pal, i might have agreed to the blow job, but there ain't no way that i'm going to swallow seamen."	4

pissed off a small, balding man storms into a local bar and demands, "gimme a double of the strongest whiskey you got. i'm so mad, i can't even see straight."     the bartender, noticing that the little man is a bit worse for the wear, pours him a double of southern comfort. the man swills down the drink and says, "gimme another one."     the bartender pours the drink but says, "now, before i give you this, why don't you let off a little steam and tell me why you're so upset?"     the man begins his tale. "well, i was sitting in the bar next-door, when this gorgeous blonde slinks in and actually sits beside me. i thought, 'wow, this has never happened before.' you know, it was kind of a fantasy come true. well, a couple of minutes later, i feel this hand moving around in my lap and the blonde leans over, licks my ear, and asks if i'm interested. i couldn't believe this was happening. i managed to nod my head yes, so she grabs my hand and starts walking out of the bar. so, of course, i went with her. this was just too good to be true."     he continues, "she took me down the street to a nice hotel and up to her room. as soon as she shut the door, she slipped out of her dress. that was all she was wearing! i tell you, it didn't take me much longer to get out of my clothes. but as soon as i jumped into the bed, i heard some keys jingling and someone starts fumbling with the door."     the blonde says, 'oh, my god, it's my boyfriend. he must have lost his wrestling match tonight. he's gonna be real mad. quick, hide!'     i opened the closet, but i figured that was probably the first place he would look, so i didn't hide there. then i looked under the bed, but i figured that he's bound to look there, too. by now, i could hear the key in the lock. i noticed the window was open, so i climbed out and was hanging there by my fingers, praying that the guy wouldn't see me..."     the bartender says, "well, i can see how you might be a bit frustrated at this point."     "well, yeah, but i hear the guy finally get the door open, and he yells, 'who you been sleeping with now, witch?'     the girl says, 'nobody, honey, now come to bed and calm down.'     well, the guy starts tearing up the room. i hear him tear the door off the closet and throw it across the room. i'm thinking, 'boy, i'm glad i didn't hide in there.' then i hear him lift up the bed and throw it across the room. good thing i didn't hide under there either. then i heard him say, 'what's that over there by the window?'     i think, 'oh god, i'm dead meat now.'     but by now the blonde is trying real hard to distract him and convince him to stop looking. well, i hear the guy go into the bathroom, and i hear water running for a long time. i figure maybe he's gonna take a bath or something, when all of a sudden, the jerk pours a pitcher of scalding hot water out of the window right on top of my head. i mean, look at this, i got second degree burns all over my scalp and shoulders!"     the bartender says, "oh man, that would have pissed me off for sure."     "no, that didn't really bother me. next, the guy starts slamming the window shut over and over on my hands. i mean, look at my fingers. they're a bloody mess. i can hardly hold this glass."     the bartender looks at the guy's hands and says, "yeah, buddy, i can understand why you are so upset."     "no, that wasn't what really pissed me off."     the bartender then asks in exasperation, "well, then, what did finally piss you off?"      "well, i was hanging there and i turned around and looked down, and i was only about 6 inches off the ground!"	4

two boys sitting across the street from a brothel the boys, who are 18 and 19 but have never been with a woman, see men go in and come out with big smiles on their faces, so they decide to go see what it's about.  they knock and this big madam opens the door, saying "what can i do for you young men?"  "we want to know why all the men in town like being here so much", the first guy says.  the madam smiles and says "well, that's going to cost you $100." the guys look at each other and the second one says "we don't have that kind of money!"  the madam says, "well how much do you have?"  they rifle through their pockets and come up with $5.25. the madam thinks about it for a second then tells them to come closer and get under the skirt of her dress. "there, now take a big smell of that, and come back when you have $100."  the fellas take a whiff, then thank the madam and walk away. once they're out of earshot, the first one looks at the second one and says "i don't think i could take $100 worth of that."	1

on monday morning, the teacher walked to the blackboard and noticed someone had written the word "penis" in tiny letters.    she turned around, but couldn't find the guilty face. she quickly erased it and began her class.  tuesday, she was again greeted with "penis" on the blackboard, written in larger letters. she looked around in vain for the culprit, and then proceeded with the day's lesson.  every morning for the rest of the week, "penis" was written on the board in larger and larger letters, and each time, the teacher furiously erased it. by friday, she'd had enough.  "that's enough," she sputtered. "i -- i can't believe this! monday morning, i expect an explanation for this behavior!"  on monday morning, the teacher confidently entered the classroom and found on the board: "don't you know -- the more you rub it, the bigger it gets?"	4
a woman dies and goes to the gates of heaven. when she gets there, she is perplexed and confused to find everyone furiously cracking eggs, dumping flour, and mixing batter.  she turns around and sees an entire section dedicated to decoration, with elaborate concoctions of strawberries, frosting, and tiering at every station.  finally, she seems to recognize someone who appears to be in charge. she runs over and asks the man, "what is going on here?"  the strange man replies, "everyone here is doing their best to better their souls." confused at the cryptic answer and curious about the strange man's traditional mongolian garb, the woman asks him to elaborate.  the buddhist monk replies, "my dear, having cake is the best way to gain karma."	5

so there was this man in bulgaria who drove trains for a living. he loved his job. driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. he loved to make the train go as fast as possible. unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. he made it out, but a single person died. well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. he was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. when the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. after eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair . the switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. the man was perfectly fine.    well, at the time, there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. the trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. for his final meal, the man requested two bananas. after eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.    well, this of course meant that he was free to go. and once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. to what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. on the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.    "you know what? no," said the executioner. "i've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. i'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now." well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. the switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. the executioner was speechless.   the man looked at the executioner and said, "oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. i'm just a bad conductor."	3

a couple go to a bar during karaoke night... and they hear a man sing to most beautiful cover of stairway to heaven they had ever heard. since they were planning their wedding at this time, they approach the man after his performance.   "wow, that was an amazing cover! would you like to come perform at the reception of our wedding?" they ask him.   "i would love to! as a matter of fact, i'm a justice too, so i could even wed you two in the same day!" he replied.   so it was settled, and the man showed up to their wedding, and wed the two together. everything was going just perfect until the reception... ever song the man sang was just horrendous, he was off key in every verse, and at some points even forgot the lyrics. the moral of the story is, never book a judge by his cover.	5

back alley memories i was reminded me of an old joke from another reddit post:   a very elderly couple is seated at a table in a bar.  the woman looks over to the man, holding his hand and says, "do you remember meeting me for the first time right here 50 years ago?"   the husband replies, "yes dear."   the wife says, "do you remember what we did afterwards?"   the husband enthusiastically says, "how could i forget!  it was magical!"   the wife looks at her husband lovingly, "you want to do it again?  let's go to the back alley like we did all those years ago"   the husband hails the waiter, pays the bill, and they slowly pack their things.  a police officer, overhearing their conversation thinks to himself, "the back alley?  that can't be safe!  i've gotta make sure they're okay back there."  the officer secretly follows the couple out and stands on the corner peaking around it to make sure they aren't in any danger.   the old woman raises her dress and takes off her panties bending over to the fence to lean on, the old man slowly drops his trousers.  he carefully grabs her by the hips and she leans forward and then suddenly...   bam bam bam bam bam!  they're banging like two jackhammers colliding!  it's like watching a shark frenzy with two sharks hungrily thrashing against one another!  the officer looks on incredulous!  this goes on for several minutes and the couple falls over panting in a steamy pile of exhaustion.  the officer leaps out from around the corner, "holy hell!  you guys are amazing how on earth do you stay so fit for something like that?!"   the old man weakly looks over to him and says, "50 years ago, this fence wasn't electric!"	3

"the duck will suffice" she says. and it was the best she ever had. "if you can do that to me again, you can have the duck back!" of course he does, then heads home with his duck.   sadly on the way, the duck flies out the window and is killed by a truck. they pull over and the truck driver is so sorry he offers the pretending to be devastated man $50.  the third son heads home, slaps his $50 on the table and watches everyone stare in amazement. "how?" they asked.  "wellll" he said with a massive grin, "i got a fuck for a duck, a duck for a fuck and fifty bucks for a fucked up duck."	5

after trying many fruits and vegetables in my kids lunch, their favourite by far was sliced cucumber. i don’t know if it was our source, or our fridge, but they only really stayed fresh for a few days. this meant that at least twice a week i was stopping at the corner grocery store to just grab a couple cucumbers.  after a couple months it became obvious that i kept buying them from the same clerk. the way he interacted with me also changed, giving me little smile’s and sometimes a wink.  all of a sudden it hit me, and i felt embarrassed by what he was probably thinking. the next time i went in i also grabbed a jar of vaseline; hopefully i fixed this before he spread any rumours about me being a vegan.	5

"wait, wait," the guy replies. he looks to his furry buddy, "rover, what's on top of this building?" the dog looks at his master, "roof! roof!"  "alright!" the bartender is now pissed, "get out or i throw you and your mangy mutt out!" he waves over the bouncer.  "okay, okay, okay, hold on!" the guy looks back at his dog, "rover, who is the greatest baseball player of all time?" the dog looks up and without hesitation, "ruth! ruth!"  the bartender has had enough, "throw 'em out!" the bouncer immediately tosses the guy and his dog into the street with little concern with how they land.  they lay there, in the road, a little worse for wear. the dog looks up at his master, "was it dimaggio?"	4

"in a dark street there is a woman in heels, waving at drivers and smoking a cigarette, who is she?"   the policeman  promptly answers: "it's obvious... she is a prostitute!"  the man replies: "eh ... i'm sorry ... too generic ... it could be your wife, your mother, your daughter, your sister ..."	2

"get your hand out of there!" she shouts. "don't you know that women have teeth down there?"  the little boy quickly snatches his hand away and thanks his lucky stars he didn't get bitten.  for the next ten years, this little boy grows up believing all women have teeth between their legs.  when he's 16, he gets a girlfriend. one night, while her parents are out, she invites him over.  after an hour she says "you know you can go a little further if you want"  "what do you mean?" he asks. "well why don't you put your hand down my pants?" she says.  "hell no" he cries, you've got teeth down there"  "don't be ridiculous," she responds, "there's no teeth down there" "yes there are" he says, "my mum told me" "no, there aren't" she insists.  "here have a look for yourself" she whips off her panties, throws her legs behind her head, and says, "look i don't have any teeth down there!" the boy takes a good long look and replies, "well, with the condition of those gums, i'm not surprised!"	4
an east end gang boss had always been very careful with whom he employed, for fear of being grassed up... he thought he'd been really clever in hiring a crooked accountant who was deaf and dumb. there wasn't much of a risk that he would overhear too much. however, it quickly dawned on the boss that someone was stealing money from him. a lot of money. and it didn't take long for him to discover it was his crooked accountant.  "benny", he ordered one of his henchmen, "get that cunt down 'ere, pronto - and get marty to come with him. he understands sign language".   later in his office, the boss started interrogating him.  "marty, ask him what he's done with the money."  at first the terrified accountant signalled his ignorance of the theft but when a gun was put to his head, he spilled the beans. with rapid hand movements, he explained that he'd hidden all the money in a trunk in an old derelict factory, two miles from the office.  "so what did he say?" demanded the boss, impatiently.  "it's no good, boss," replied marty. "he says you haven't got the bottle to shoot him, so you can go and get fucked".	5

a school teacher, a police officer, and a hedge fund founder are trapped on a deserted island. after scavenging for days with little success, they come across a magical lamp.  the officer decides to give it a quick rub and out pops a genie.  "hello, i am here to grant each of you an imperishable supply of food and water as you await your rescue.  be warned, it can only be consumed only by you.  all you have to do in return is to give me something of value.  if you manage to leave this island alive, the item will be returned to you."  after a brief silence as the three contemplated the situation, the teacher hands over her engagement ring.  "i am not sure how much this is worth, but it is the thing i treasure the most."  the genie looks at the ring.  "you shall receive two weeks supply of food and water."  the food and water materialize out of thin air and the woman is a bit disheartened at the short supply but nevertheless thanks the genie.  seeing this, the officer steps up.  "this is the key to my 2017 dodge challenger srt."  the genie frowns.  "this is just a key, but i admire your wit. 3 months supply for you."  the officer smiles and walks away.  the hedge fund manager steps up to the genie and smiles.  "here, take my phone."  the genie looks amused.  "i assume you are offering your fund?"  "sure am!"  the man states.  the genie nods and a single bottle of nestle water materializes.  "what the fucking hell is this?  that damn cop gave you a car that has depreciated to $35k and that woman's ring cannot be worth more than $5k! i gave you more than $20 billion you fool!"  the genie paused for a moment, sensing the rage building in the billionaire's eyes.  "your numbers are right but why would you assume i have an endless supply of food and water?  surely, this cannot be the first time you have come up short."	3

"but . . . you're blind! how are you going to play soccer?" the driver asks, baffled.  "there's a bell inside our soccer ball, so we can keep track of where the ball is by listening for it," he replies.  so, the bus driver shrugs and heads to the cafeteria. he eats his lunch, takes a rest, and returns one hour later. upon returning, he sees a crowd gathered and an ambulance parked near their bus. he gets worried and rushes to investigate. he gets closer and inquires.  "what's wrong? what happened?" he asks from a man among the crowd.  "well," the man replies, "a busload of blind people kicked the shit out of a tambourine dancer."	2

the irs decided to audit grandpa, and summoned him to the irs office. the irs auditor was not surprised when grandpa showed up with his attorney. the auditor said, “well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. i’m not sure the irs finds that believable.”  “i’m a great gambler, and i can prove it,” says grandpa. “how about a demonstration?”  the auditor thinks for a moment and says, “ok. go ahead.” grandpa says, “i’ll bet you a thousand dollars that i can bite my own eye.”  the auditor thinks a moment and says, “it’s a bet.” grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. the auditor’s jaw drops.  grandpa says, “now, i’ll bet you two thousand dollars that i can bite my other eye.”  the auditor can tell grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet. grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. the stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with grandpa’s attorney as a witness. he starts to get nervous.  “want to go double or nothing?” grandpa asks. “i’ll bet you six thousand dollars that i can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.”  the auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.   grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.  the auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. but grandpa’s attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.  “are you ok?” the auditor asks. “not really,” says the attorney. “this morning, when grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.”	5

two priests are showering two priests are showering when one says to the other “damn i’m out of soap”   the other priest says “i’ll go to my office and get some”.  so the priest picks up two bars of soap from his office, but on his way back he hears the voices of two nuns down the hall.   the priest, stark naked with nowhere to hide, decides to freeze in place. the nuns walk by but of course stop when they see the priest.   “what is this?” asks the first nun.   “must be a new statue” says the other.   “it’s so lifelike and detailed” marvels the first nun, as she begins to run her fingers along the “statue”.  suddenly, the enamored nun is hit with an inexplicable urge to pull the “statue’s” third leg.   the priest did all he could to stay frozen, but he couldn’t stop himself from dropping one of the bars of soap.   the second nun says “why’d you do that?”   “i don’t know,” replies the first nun, “but i think this statue might be a soap dispenser.”   “let me try!” exclaims the second nun.   she too pulls the “statue’s” third leg , and sure enough, the second bar of soap is dropped.   “it is a soap dispenser!” says the first nun excitedly.   she pulls again, but this time of course no soap appears. she pulls again.   and again.   and again.   the second nun gives it a go.   “oh look. hand cream!”	3

"wow", says the new prisoner. "can i have a go? "  "sure, just go up on the stage".  so the man walks to the front.  "18" he calls out.   silence.  "34"  silence. not a peep "7" he says hopefully.  nothing  he goes back to his seat "how come no one laughed? "  "it's the way you tell 'em"	2

"you're on."  at age 42, they meet and play golf again  "where you wanna go for lunch?"    "hooters."    "again?  why?"    "they have cold beer, big screen tvs, and side action on the games."    "ok."  at age 52 they meet and play again. "so where you wanna go for lunch?"  "hooters.    "why?"    "the food is pretty good and there's plenty of parking."    "ok."  at age 62 they meet again.  after a round of golf, one says, "where you wanna go?"    "hooters."    "why?"    "wings are half price and the food isn't too spicy."

i love the dave joke so much i decided to write a sequel  at first dave’s boss in in complete disbelief at dave’s popularity. but he slowly comes to his senses. he reasons that dave couldn’t possibly know *every* person. nevertheless, if he wants to catch dave, naming people out of the blue isn’t working. he has to come up with a new strategy. he sits down to do some research to find a person dave couldn’t possibly know.  after some time, he finally finds the perfect candidate. on a small island just off the coast of ireland, there’s a holy man. he’s vowed to live a life of solitude to grow closer to god. he makes his own food, keeps his own animals, sews his own clothes—he’s never even laid eyes on another living person except his parents and a member of the local village who annually checks if he’s still alive. there is no possible way dave could know this guy.  furthermore, dave’s boss reasons that dave might be secretly rich—just calling people up and paying tons of money to act like they were friends. to avoid this, he won’t let dave know the person they were visiting ahead of time.  with this plan in mind, he gets up, “hey, dave. there’s someone in ireland i’m sure you don’t know.” “no way boss”, dave retorts, “i know everyone in ireland.” so the two of them get on a plane and go to ireland, and drive for hours until they’re on dirt roads, then arrive at this tiny stone village in the middle of nowhere that looks like it’s from the middle ages. they finally arrive at a house labeled “ye old inn”. dave sees how exhausted his boss is from driving and asks, “hey, why don’t i go check us in, you can stay here.”  when dave gets back outside, he sees the boss passed out on the ground in the arms of a local. “what happened?” dave utters in disbelief. the local guy looks up at him, panicked, “i don’t know! all i did was thank your driver for making sure you arrived on time this year!”	4

who's the boss of the body? one day, certain parts of the body got into an argument over who was in charge. the eyes said "well, we're in charge because without us, the body wouldn't be able to interact with the world."  "are you kidding??" said the legs. "without us, you eyes would have nothing to see except a ceiling. we take you places!"  "guys, this is embarrassing," said the brain. "if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't walk or process anything. obviously, i'm the boss here."  this caused an uproar and all parts of the body began to shout. only the anus kept quiet. and all the anus did was close itself up. and waited.   the body became constipated. the eyes rolled back, the legs became weak and the brain was frazzled.   which goes to show that if you want to be the boss, sometimes you have to be an asshole.	1

golfing  two women were playing golf. one teed off and watched in horror as her ball headed directly toward a foursome of men playing the next hole.  the ball hit one of the men.  he immediately clasped his hands together at his groin, fell to the ground and proceeded to roll around in agony. the woman rushed down to the man, and immediately began to apologize.   'please allow me to help. i'm a physical therapist and i know i could relieve your pain if you'd allow me, she told him.  'oh, no, i'll be all right. i'll be fine in a few minutes,' the man replied. he was in obvious agony, lying in the fetal position, still clasping his hands there at his groin.  at her persistence, however, he finally allowed her to help. she gently took his hands away and laid them to the side, loosened his pants and put her hands inside.  she administered tender and artful massage for several long moments and asked, 'how does that feel'?  he replied: it feels great, but i still think my thumb's broken!	3

bad parrot david received a parrot for his birthday.  the parrot was fully grown with a bad attitude and worse vocabulary.  every other word was an obscenity.  those that weren’t expletives, were to say the least, rude.  david tried hard to change the bird’s attitude and was constantly saying polite words, playing soft music, anything he could think of. nothing worked.  he yelled at the bird and the bird yelled back.  he shocked the bird and the bird just got more angry and more rude.  finally, in a moment of desperation, david put the bird in the freezer, just for a few moments.  he heard the bird squawk and kick and scream-then suddenly, there was quiet. david was frightened that he might have hurt the bird and quickly opened the freezer door.  the parrot calmly stepped out and said “i believe i may have offended you with my rude language and actions. i’ll endeavor at once to correct my behavior. i really am truly sorry and beg your forgiveness.”  david was astonished at the bird’s change in attitude and was about to ask what had made such a dramatic change when the parrot continued, “may i ask what did the chicken do?”	3

historical context on how to pronounce the sauce  since we are talking about how to pronounce the sauce. i though i would give some historical context i was talk when i was younger.  in the 19th century, 2 men in england created a new sauce. it was savory, and went well with potatoes and meats. the 2 men didn't know what to call this sauce, so they thought they would have the local townsfolk try it and listen to their reactions to see if they could come up with a name for the sauce.  one by one the townsfolk tasted the sauce and gave their reactions:  "savory", one said.  "this would go well with my potatoes", another would say, but the 2 men still weren't satisfied enough to give the sauce a name.  there so happened, at the same time, a gentlemen scotsman with the last name of connery was in the area. the 2 men knew that if they could get him to taste the sauce, maybe he would give them a good enough response to name the sauce.  the inquired of this connery to see if he would taste the sauce. after some encouragement, he finally decided to taste the sauce and give his reaction.  the 2 men give mr. connery a spoonful of the sauce.  mr. connery tasted it and stopped, licked his lips and said to the men:  "what's this here sauce?"	1

nsfw: a cowboy rides in off the prairie feeling mighty anxious after not enjoying any female companionship for several months. he spots a beauty that he sets his sights on and begins to engage her in amorous conversation at the local saloon.  he doesn't get very far before the woman shuts him down. ""you're just wasting your time cowboy. you see, i'm a lesbian."  being not very sophisticated the cowboy asks her, "what's religion got to do with us getting better acquainted?"  "it's nothing to do with religion cowboy. you see being a lesbian refers to my sexual orientation.  still confused, the cowboy asks her what that means?  "you see i'm not interested having sex with men. i like woman. only women i like to kiss them, feel their breasts, and nice round backsides. i enjoy sucking on their nipples and really love to lick their pussies."  "oh," sighed the old cowboy & he just walks away, up to the bar and orders himself a bottle of red eye.  the bartender seeing the cowboy's pretty down in the mouth asks him what's wrong.  "well i'll tell you partner, i've always figured i was quite the man. but after all these years i've discovered, i'm a lesbian!"	2

just beyond the gates of hell, an alcoholic, a womanizer, and a stoner find themselves standing in front of three identical doors. just beyond the gates of hell, an alcoholic, a womanizer, and a stoner find themselves standing in front of three identical doors. there to greet them is none other than satan, who tells them a secret method to getting into heaven: each man must spend 1,000 years in a room with their greatest vice. if he does so, he will be allowed to enter heaven. the catch? at the end of the 1,000 year period, if the man asks to be let out of the room, he instead will be trapped inside forever.  the first man, being a lifelong alcoholic, is presented with a room identical to his favorite drinking spot. some of his old drinking buddies are present, along with infinitely replenishing spirits of all kinds! the first man is ecstatic and, thinking it will be an easy feat, runs inside and slams the door behind him.  the second man, known for being quite the pervert, immediately feels his blood start pumping as the second door is opened. inside are women of every shape, size, color, you name it. every woman this man has ever fantasized about is here, ready to obey his every command. without a word the second man rushes inside, closing the door behind him.  now the third man, having been a cannabis connoisseur for most of his life, stands in awe of the marvel before him. inside his room is a forest containing every strand of marijuana conceivable; the shrubs are the most beautiful green hues, ebitting the stickiest of smells; the ground is littered with the highest quality nuggs, the dirt is hash rocks and kief, and the trees are actually twenty foot tall plants. the stoner can't wait to get eternally stoned and happily jaunts inside his room.  1,000 years pass...  satan, being a man of his word, decides to check on each of the men. he opens the door to the first man's room, only to find the most disgusting mess he had ever seen: blood, booze, and bodily fluids create a disgusting miasma throughout the room. broken glass litters the floor, and the man's once-friends lie dead in various states of decay. after searching for a while, satan happens upon the man, shrivelled up and nestled in a pile of bottles, crying and bleeding profusely. the man's wracking sobs stop as his trembling lips work to form a sentence: "p-please... get m-me out of here..." satan, a man of his word, reminds the man of the condition upon which he was imprisoned, and having broken his end of the bargain, the man is trapped inside eternally.  "the second man must have done better than that one", satan thinks to himself while opening the second door. moments later, hundreds upon thousands of people come flooding out, men, women, children of all creeds, along with the scents of human waste and burnt flesh. eventually satan sees the man he locked in here riding the wave of people. "get me out of here!" the man screams, and satan seals the door forever.  the third door is all that remains now; as satan opens it, he sees the stoner meditating in the center of the forest, surrounded by a pool of tears. the forest had been untouched for the full thousand years. satan is understandably quite confused! the stoner opens his eyes in disbelief and runs over to satan, and shaking him by the collar he says: "do you have a lighter, man?!"	5

britain is repossessing the u.s.a.   john cleese has just announced that to resolve the impasse in the us election he has written to everyone in the us as follows:  a message from john cleese (monty python)  to the citizens of the united states of america:  in light of your failure to nominate competent candidates for president of the usa and thus to govern yourselves, we hereby give notice of the revocation of your independence, effective immediately.  her sovereign majesty queen elizabeth ii will resume monarchical duties over all states, commonwealths, and territories (except arkansas, which she does not fancy).  your new prime minister, boris johnson, will appoint a governor for america without the need for further elections.  congress and the senate will be disbanded.  a questionnaire may be circulated next year to determine whether any of you noticed.  to aid in the transition to a british crown dependency, the following rules are introduced with immediate effect:  you should look up "revocation" in the oxford english dictionary.  1. then look up aluminium, and check the pronunciation guide. you will be amazed at just how wrongly you have been pronouncing it.  2. the letter 'u' will be reinstated in words such as 'favour' and 'neighbour.' likewise, you will learn to spell 'doughnut' without skipping half the letters, and the suffix -ize will be replaced by the suffix -ise.  generally, you will be expected to raise your vocabulary to acceptable levels. (look up 'vocabulary').  3. using the same twenty-seven words interspersed with filler noises such as "like" and "you know" is an unacceptable and inefficient form of communication.  there is no such thing as us english. we will let microsoft know on your behalf. the microsoft spell- checker will be adjusted to take account of the reinstated letter 'u' and the elimination of -ize. you will relearn your original national anthem, god save the queen.  4. july 4th will no longer be celebrated as a holiday.  5. you will learn to resolve personal issues without using guns, lawyers, or therapists. the fact that you need so many lawyers and therapists shows that you're not adult enough to be independent.  guns should only be handled by adults. if you're not adult enough to sort things out without suing someone or speaking to a therapist then you're not grown up enough to handle a gun.  6. therefore, you will no longer be allowed to own or carry anything more dangerous than a vegetable peeler. a permit will be required if you wish to carry a vegetable peeler in public.  7. all american cars are hereby banned. they are crap and this is for your own good. when we show you german cars, you will understand what we mean.  8. all intersections will be replaced with roundabouts, and you will start driving on the left with immediate effect. at the same time, you will go metric with immediate effect and without the benefit of conversion tables.  both roundabouts and metrification will help you understand the british sense of humour.  9. the former usa will adopt uk prices on petrol (which you have been calling gasoline)-roughly $10/us gallon. get used to it.  10. you will learn to make real chips. those things you call french fries are not real chips, and those things you insist on calling potato chips are properly called crisps. real chips are thick cut, fried in animal fat, and dressed not with catsup but with vinegar.  11. the cold tasteless stuff you insist on calling beer is not actually beer at all. henceforth, only proper british bitter will be referred to as beer, and european brews of known and accepted provenance will be referred to as lager.  south african beer is also acceptable as they are pound for pound the greatest sporting nation on earth and it can only be due to the beer. they are also part of british commonwealth - see what it did for them.  12. hollywood will be required occasionally to cast english actors as good guys. hollywood will also be required to cast english actors to play english characters.  watching andie macdowell attempt english dialogue in four weddings and a funeral was an experience akin to having one's ears removed with a cheese grater.  13. you will cease playing american football. there is only one kind of proper football; you call it soccer. those of you brave enough will, in time, be allowed to play rugby (which has some similarities to american football, but does not involve stopping for a rest every twenty seconds or wearing full kevlar body armour like a bunch of nancies). don't try rugby - the south africans and kiwis will thrash you, like they regularly thrash us. no more orange bowl, rose bowl, cereal bowl or super bowl. from now on..... get used to the world cup.  14. further, you will stop playing baseball. it is not reasonable to host an event called the world series for a game which is not played outside of america. since only 2.1% of you are aware that there is a world beyond your borders, your error is understandable. you will learn cricket, and we will let you face the south africans first to take the sting out of their deliveries.  15. you must tell us who killed jfk. it's been driving us mad.  16. an internal revenue agent (i.e. tax collector) from her majesty's government will be with you shortly to ensure the acquisition of all monies due (backdated to 1776).  17. daily tea time begins promptly at 4 pm with proper cups, never mugs, with high quality biscuits (cookies) and cakes; strawberries in season.  god save the queen.  john cleese	1

6 life lessons 6 life lessons  **lesson 1:**  a man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. the wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. when she opens the door, there stands bob, the next door neighbour. before she says a word, bob says, “i’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” after thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of bob.  after a few seconds, bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. the woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. when she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…  “who was that?” “it was bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “great!” the husband says, “did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”  *moral of the story:*  if you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.  **lesson 2:**  a sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. they rub it and a genie comes out. the genie says, “i’ll give each of you just one wish” “me first! me first!” says the administration clerk. “i want to be in the bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” poof! she’s gone. “me next! me next!” says the sales rep. “i want to be in hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of pina coladas and the love of my life.” poof! he’s gone. “ok, you’re up,” the genie says to the manager. the manager says, “i want those two back in the office after lunch.”  *moral of the story:*  always let your boss have the first say  **lesson 3:**  a priest offered a lift to a nun. she got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. the priest nearly had an accident. after controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. the nun said,”father, remember psalm 129?” the priest removed his hand. but, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. the nun once again said, “father, remember psalm 129?” the priest apologized “sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. on his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up psalm 129. it said, “go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”  *moral of the story:*  if you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity  **lesson 4**  a crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. a rabbit asked him, ”can i also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” the crow answered: “sure, why not.” so, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.  a fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.  *moral of the story:*  to be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up  **lesson 5:**  power of charisma  a turkey was chatting with a bull “i would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but i haven’t got the energy.” “well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “they’re packed with nutrients.” the turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. the next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.  *moral of the story:*  bullshit might get you to the top, but it wont keep you there  **lesson 6**  a little bird was flying south for the winter. it was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. while he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. as the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. the dung was actually thawing him out! he lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. a passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.  *moral of the story:*  1. not everyone who shits on you is your enemy 2. not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend 3. and when you’re in deep shit, it’s best to keep your mouth shut!	5

there's this kid named tommy. he has no body. he is just a head. tommy was born without a body or any limbs, so his entire life he has existed as a head only-- he learned to roll around, use his mouth to maneuver things, and live just like a normal kid.   one day tommy rolled into school just like any other day, banged against his locker to open it, started to get his books when, all of a sudden, he spots a new student.  tommy thinks she's absolutely beautiful. her hair is perfect, her body is amazing (which tommy slightly envied, but had gotten over those thoughts mostly by now), and she had an amazing sense of fashion. there was just one thing off about this girl though; she only had one eye, and in place of her other eye was a prosthetic eye made of wood. it didn't even look like a real eye, it just looked wooden.  tommy saw her and his jaw dropped to the floor-- "what's her name?" he asked a friend.  "oh, her? that's sally, the girl with a wooden eye."  tommy saw past her wooden eye and was starstruck ever since he first laid eyes on sally. he made it his mission to ask sally to prom.  weeks later, tommy finally gathered the courage to ask his crush the big question. he rolled up to her in the cafeteria and said, "hey sally, i'm tommy. i was wondering if you wanted to go to prom with me?"  sally looked down at him for a second, and said, " uhmm.. i'm sorry tommy.. i don't think so."  this devastated tommy. he had felt all sorts of pain and denial in his life from not having a body. he knew what rejection and denial felt like having been left out of all the activities full bodied people could do. but nothing hurt quite as much as this. his heart was shattered. and then tommy turned into a grape.  so now tommy is a grape, just rolling around school, and he is depressed like never before. people see tommy and notice that something is off with him. he's so depressed, that he turned into a grape.  sally sees this and begins to feel really bad. "was i too harsh?" she asked a friend, " maybe i should go try to make it up to him." now sally made it her mission to ask tommy to the prom, and hopefully he would return to normal.  after school, sally went by tommy's house and knocked on the door. tommy answered, and she was surprised for a second that a grape could answer the door-- but nonetheless, she moved forward with her mission.  "tommy, i wanted to ask you something... would you go to prom with me?"  tommy didn't believe his ears for a second-- the most beautiful girl he had ever seen had just asked him to the prom! without thinking, he replied,  "oh wood eye, wood eye!"  sally was offended and crushed him.  the moral of the story: stop while you're a head.	5

a dude walks into a restaurant and says,  "where's the fucking manager you cock-sucker?"   the host is surprised and replies, "excuse me, but could you please refrain from using that sort of language in here, i will get the manager as soon as i can."   the manager comes over and the dude asks, "are you the fucking manager of this shit joint?"  "yes, sir, i am," replies the manager, "and i would prefer it if you could refrain from swearing in this restaurant."  "fuck off!" replies the dude. "and where's the fucking piano?"   "what?" says the manager.   "fucking deaf are we? you little piece of shit, show me your fucking piano."   "oh, you're here for the pianist job. can you play any blues?" says the manager showing the dude the piano.   "of course i fucking can," and the guy plays the most inspiring and beautiful blues that the manager has ever heard.   "that's good, what's it called?"   "i want to fuck your wife on the couch but the springs keep hurting my balls," replies the pianist.   the manager is disturbed but asks if he knows jazz. so he proceeds to play the best jazz solo the manager has ever heard. "great!" cries the manager. "what's it called?"   "i wanted to fuck your daughter but she's still at school."   the manager gets angry but asks if he knows any ballads, he then plays the most heartbreaking melody.   "and what's this called?" asks the manager.   "as i fuck her under the stars, the moonlight shines off her hairy pussy," he replies.   the manager is upset but offers him the job if he doesn't introduce any of his songs or talk to any of the customers. this arrangement works well for a little bit, until one night, sitting opposite him, is the most gorgeous blonde the dude has ever seen. she's wearing a see through dress and her tits are falling out the top. she is sitting there with her legs wide open, staring at him. it's too much for him so he runs off to the restroom to yank one out.   he's pulling away furiously when he hears the manager yell "where's that pianist!?" he just has time to cum and then he runs back to the piano, not having bothered to adjust himself right, sits down and starts playing his music.   the blonde steps up and walks over to the piano, leans over and whispers in his ear: "do you know your cock is hanging out of your pants and dripping jizz on your shoes?"   "know it," he replies, "i fucking wrote it!"	5

two 90 year old men, mike and joe, have been friends all of their lives. when it's clear that joe is dying, mike visits him every day.     one  day mike says, "joe, we both loved football all our lives, and we  played football on saturdays together for so many years. please do me  one favour, when you get to heaven, somehow you must let me know if  there's football there."     joe looks up at mike from his death bed,  "mike, you've been my best friend for many years. if it's at all  possible, i'll do this favour for you.     shortly after that, joe passes away.     a  couple of nights later, at midnight, mike is awakened from a sound  sleep by a blinding flash of white light and a voice calling out to him,  "mike--mike."     "who is it ?" asks mike sitting up suddenly. "who is it?"     "mike--it's me, joe."     "you're not joe. joe just died."     "i'm telling you, it's me, joe," insists the voice."     "joe! where are you?"     "in heaven", replies joe. "i have some really good news and a little bad news."     "tell me the good news first," says mike.     "the  good news," joe says," is that there's football in heaven. better yet,  all of our old friends who died before us are here, too. better than  that, we're all young again. better still, it's always spring time and  it never rains or snows. and best of all, we can play football all we  want, and we never get tired."     that's fantastic," says mike. "it's beyond my wildest dreams !" "so, what's the bad news ?"     "you're in the team for this saturday's match !!!"	1

"do you understand that what matters is not whether we win or lose, but how we play together as a team?"  the little boy nodded once more.  "so..." the coach continued. "i'm sure you know that when a penalty is called, you shouldn't argue, curse, attack the referee, or call him a pecker-head. do you understand all that?"  again the little boy nodded.  he continued, "and when i call you off the ice so that another boy gets a chance to play, it's not good sportsmanship to call your coach a dumb asshole, is it?"  the little boy nodded yet again.  "good." said the coach. "now go over there and explain all that to your mother."	5

sherlock holmes and watson go camping they spend the day tracking small animals, fishing, and having a grand time by the shores of a remote lake, before cooking up their dinner and settling into their beds and drifting off to sleep.  sometime after midnight, holmes wakes up feeling insightful. he wakes watson up.  "watson... as you look up into the night sky, what do you deduce?"  watson rubs his bleary eyes, unsure what to make of sherlocks sudden midnight curiosity. he rolls over and stares up into the sky, which was lit up with a million stars like diamonds on black velvet.  watson responds. "well holmes, as i stare into the cosmos, i can see that we are on a spinning ball in an infathomable expanse of nothing. the vast emptiness of space and scale of the universe leaves me feeling incredibly tiny, and therefore i deduce that our lives are small and insignificant in the greater scheme of things."   holmes ponders this deep and insightful response for a moment. rarely is watson so articulate with his feelings.  he turns to watson, and with a sigh, he says.

a man arrives in heaven... a man arrives in heaven and st. peter asks him how he died.   "i came home from work early," the man says, "because i suspected my wife was having an affair."  "sure enough, there she was in bed naked, obviously caught in the act. she was alone, but i knew her lover had to be close by. then i noticed the open window."  "i ran to the window and saw a naked man hanging by his fingers. enraged, i began to strike him until he finally let go, plunging five stories to what i assumed would be his death. unfortunately the bastard landed in some bushes and i could see he was still moving. so i ran back into our house and with all the adrenalin i managed to carry my fridge to the window and drop it on the man who had been shtooping my wife."  "after all of that excitement i think i had a heart attack, because i remember a searing pain in my chest and then i was here."  st. peter is entertained by the man's story and tells him to enter into heaven. then the saint turns to the next man in line and says, "how did you arrive in heaven my child?"  "well," says the man "i has just finished taking a shower and was drying off when i tripped and fell, naked, out the window."  "i managed to grab hold of the window ledge below mine and was trying to pull myself up when a crazy man came to the window and started punching me in the face!"  "he hit me so hard i lost my grip and plummeted to the ground. luckily, i landed in some bushes. dazed, i tried to crawl away but this lunatic proceeded to drop a fridge on my head!"  peter finds this story even funnier than the last and tells the man to continue on to paradise.   turning to the next man, peter asks again "how did you arrive in heaven my child?"  the man looks at the saint and says, "so get this: i'm hiding in a fridge..."	5

a tale of two friends !!  one was a very bright student while the other one was quite dumb. the brighter one always helped the other passing exams be it a class test or end term exams. the teachers were quite furious with them and at last, called upon a meeting to discuss with the principal what could be done. all came to the conclusion that both of them will be interviewed separately and have to pass it in order to move onto a higher standard. first, the brighter student was interviewed. the panel asked him "when did india get its freedom ?". he answered, " the struggle started way back in 1943 and finally it happened in 1947". the panel was impressed and asked him one more question - "can you name at least one freedom fighter who died fighting for the struggle for freedom ?". he answered, "sorry sir, but i should not name only a single one because it will be disrespectful for the others who all fought for the cause.  ". the panelists were awestruck. they asked the student to send in the dumb one after him. but, being his best friend, he told his dumb friend everything that was asked in the interview and also told him exactly what to answer. the student went in and the panelist started asking him questions. first, they asked him "when were you born ?". he replied in a very confident voice "sir, the struggle started way back in 1943 but finally it happened in 1947". the panelists were shocked and couldn't hold their laughter. next, they asked, "what is your father's name ?". being confident he answered in a very fluent way "sorry sir, but i should not name only a single one because it will be disrespectful for the others who all fought for the cause".	5

a man was walking home past a cemetary in the middle of the night.  when he hears a bump... bump... bump... behind him.  walking faster he looks back, and makes out the image of an upright coffin banging its way down the middle of the street towards him.  bump... bump... bump...  terrified, the man begins to run towards his home, the coffin bouncing quickly behind him ...  faster... faster... bump... bump... bump...  he runs up to his door, fumbles with his keys, opens the door, rushes in, slams and locks the door behind him.  however, the coffin crashes through his door, with the lid of the coffin clapping...  clappity-bump... clappity-bump... clappity-bump... on the heels of the terrified man.  rushing upstairs to the bathroom, the man locks himself in.  his heart is pounding; his head is reeling; his breath is coming in sobbing gasps.  with a loud crash the coffin starts breaking down the door. bumping and clapping towards him.  the man screams and reaches for something heavy, anything .. his hand comes to rest on a large bottle of robitussin.  desperate, he throws the cough syrup as hard as he can at the apparition... and...  the coffin stops.	5

the battle of little big horn you've heard of the battle of little big horn right? well a few months after that, while custer was lauded as a hero of the union, a museum in kansas wanted to generate some business and thought up a great idea.   the curator would hire an artist to paint "general custers last thought". once the painting was done he would hold a grand unveiling where all the big wigs would gather and draw a crowd.  and wouldn't you know, it worked. why even the governor showed up with his wife and kids. and while people were touring the museum the main focus was a floor to ceiling velvet curtain that hid the main attaction.  well after a spell, the curator went up in front of the curtain and spoke with passion about the fallen general and the seventh calvary. once he finished, he gestured to the artist who was holding the rope. the artist did as instructed and pulled the rope.  the curtain flew open  everyone's jaw dropped  the painting itself was simple enough. most of the space on this huge painting was devoted to a simple dairy cow with a little halo over its head. the rest of the painting however, the part that wasnt a massive cow, was filled to the edges with native americans having sex. every position imaginable was on display.  it was akin to the kama sutra.  once the curator had regained his composure, he turned sharply upon the artist.  "what in the name of the almighty is this?"  "custers last thought. just like you asked." the artist replied.  "well what the heck is it"  holy cow. look at all those fucking indians.	3

an old couple had been married for 50 years. they were sitting at the breakfast table one morning when the old gentleman said to his wife, “just think, we’ve been married for 50 years.” “yeah,” she replied. “just think, fifty years ago we were sitting here at this breakfast table together.”   “i know,” the old man said, “but we were probably sitting here stark naked fifty years ago.”   “well,” granny snickered, “what do you say, should we strip?”   so the two stripped to the buff and sat down at the table.   “you know, honey,” the little old lady said, “my nipples are as hot for you today as they were fifty years ago."   “i wouldn’t be surprised,” replied gramps. “one’s in your coffee and the other is in your porridge.”	5
if your doctor spoke like trump so it seems you’ve tested positive for the chinese virus, the so-called covid nineteen, the corona—nobody knows what to call it, quite frankly. it’s the most amazing thing, no one knew anything about corona until a few weeks ago.   but the moment i heard about it—the wuhan flu; it’s also the wuhan, or wuhaan—that’s a city in china. many people don’t know that. but the moment i heard about this chinese flu, i ordered a test. and it’s an amazing test. we do better testing than anywhere in the world. some say the germans have the best tests, but they don’t. our tests are even better.  so you’re positive for corona. and usually “positive” is a positive word—it’s a very good word, frankly. everybody thinks it’s good, apart from what you hear on the news—which is fake. it’s largely fake. but in medicine, “positive” is not so good. so it’s very confusing. and i’ve always been very clear about that. some say “positive” is always good, but i’ve never agreed with that.  so you’re positive for the corona. but you’ll be fine. totally fine. you might think you’re going to die—and everybody does die, eventually. but you’ll be fine. you feel fine, right? you won’t need a ventilator. there are no ventilators—but you won’t need one.   how old are you, 55? you won’t need one. some people need a ventilator, and they’re amazing machines. did you know the first ventilator was made by henry ford? it’s an incredible piece of equipment. but you’ll be fine.  the virus gets into your lungs, which is where you breathe. but you have two of them. some say you have a spare. some people only have one lung. it’s true. but i don’t talk about spares. i always want both. given a choice, i want two lungs.  so i’ve asked nurse—what’s your name, nancy?—i’ve asked nurse nancy to keep you comfortable. and nancy is one of our finest nurses. i mean, just look at her. incredible, right? nancy, you’re really incredible. you’re not afraid of corona, are you, the chinese plague? i didn’t think so. nancy will bring you whatever you need. and if you start coughing, do that into your elbow, so you don’t make a mess. okay, you’re doing great. i’ll see you later.	5

richard's daughter was getting married. she was his princess so he wanted to make her day everything she'd dreamed of. a gorgeous wedding chapel, a gourmet chef for the catering, and  dozens of bottles of the finest champagne to be served in authentic italian crystal. except for the fact that richard was an elementary school teacher and such extravagance was well beyond his means.  he tried going to the banks, but every bank in town turned him down because of his bad credit.  he sold his old comic books and baseball cards but his small collection didn't net him much.  his friends at work scraped together what they could, but even that wasn't enough.  his daughter told him that it didn't matter, that a simple wedding was enough for her; he knew, but he still wanted to spoil his little girl one last time.  one day, he was perusing want ads for a second job and saw a man in a fine suit walking by. a fat envelope dropped out of the man's newspaper and hit the ground. when the man didn't turn around to retrieve it, richard jogged over and picked it up. he caught up to the man in the suit and tapped him on the shoulder.  the man turned around and speared richard with a glare.  "whaddya want?"  "y-you dropped something." richard proffered the envelope to the suited man who snatched it away, opened it, and began counting dozens of hundred dollar bills.  "you didn't take anything. you didn't even open it!" he seemed incredulous.  "it's not my business to. have a nice day." richard turned to leave but the suited man grabbed his elbow.  "i can't just let you go. if i'd have lost this dough i'd be a dead man. i always repay favors. if you ever need a favor, come here and ask for paulo." he slipped a business card into richard's pocket and strode away.  later that night richard decided to take the man up on his offer. the address was a ritzy italian restaurant he'd never been to. he wore his best suit and rehearsed what he'd ask for if the man was serious about helping.  he walked in the door and felt immediately out of place. at the tables were all sorts of business owners, politicians, and even hollywood actors. the host took one look at richard's cheap suit and looked as if he were about to shoo him away.    richard cleared his throat and said, "i'm here to see paulo."  the host blinked and gestured for richard to follow him.  richard followed the host down a long hallway with increasingly sparse lighting. the noise of the restaurant faded as they walked deeper and deeper into the building. they soon came to an ornamented door and the host knocked a pattern of quick taps. a slot opened up at head height to reveal the face of the man richard had met earlier. the man nodded to the host, who walked back the way they came.  the man, whom richard assumed was paulo, opened the door and beckoned him inside. the door shut behind him and the room was pitch black. richard felt panic welling up before paulo opened a door on the other side of the room.  light flooded through and revealed a well-dressed italian man behind a rich mahogany desk. he was stroking a white persian cat while a phonograph played soft opera music.  "i understand you have done a great service for my son paulo," the seated man said, "and i would be remiss if i didn't return the favor on his behalf. do you have any questions before we get down to business?"  "just one, sir. why don't you have any lights in the other room?"  "it's a simple reason. it's always darkest before the don."	2

a man gets diarrhea and decides to ask for help to his neighbor who happens to be a doctor. he crosses the road and rings to the door. the neighbor welcomes him in:  “hey, how are you? sorry if i’m in a hurry but i need to leave in half an hour and i’m still packing. do you need anything?”  “oh, i didn’t know, sorry to bother you, i just wanted to ask for advice really quick, i got diarrhea but tomorrow i have an important presentation at work, do you have something that can help me?”  “sure, but i really gotta go, just take the pills in the blue box, they’re in the cabinet in the kitchen.”  the guy goes and takes the pills from the blue box, he thanks the neighbor and goes home. right after he leaves the doctor checks in the kitchen and finds out the man took the antidepressants instead of the pills for diarrhea. he says to himself “i will call him as soon as i can and tell him”, but since he needs to finish packing fast he forgets. the day after, he remembers and calls immediately the neighbor:  “hey dude, are you ok, did you already take the pills?”  “yes, i was just about to call you, i really wanted to thank you! today during the presentation i suddenly farted so hard that i shat in my pants, but thank god i didn’t give a shit!”	1

five gangsters walk past a local diner the owner runs out the door and up to them saying, "excuse me, i've got a problem and you're the only ones who can solve it!"  the gangsters look at each other confused and ask, "what, why us man?"  "i'll explain later, just come with me!" the owner replies. the curious gangsters follow the owner into the diner, and then they enter the kitchen. in the back, a man is furiously scrubbing metal pots and pans so hard that he's damaging them.  the owner points at the man and says, "my new dishwasher guy is scrubbing the dishes too hard! he's scratching them up and refusing to stop! at this rate, i'm going to have to replace all my dishes!"  one of the gangsters rolls his eyes and says to another gangster, "yo g, i got this."   the gangster taps the dishwasher on the shoulder and says, "dude, ease up on those dishes."  but the man keeps scrubbing. another one of the gangsters says, "that won't do it, g," and he tries to spin the dishwasher around to face them, but the dishwasher man won't budge. "c'mon idiot, ease up on those dishes!"  but the man is still scrubbing. the third and fourth gangsters try shouting in the man's ears, "ease up on those damn dishes!"  but the man scrubs away. finally, the fifth gangster has had enough and start pulling on the dishwasher to get him away from the sink and the dishes. another g joins in, followed by the rest, pulling as hard as they can.  but it's no use, and they all fall to the floor exhausted while the dishwasher keeps scrubbing, no sign of easing up on the poor dishes.  the owner is shocked and shakes his head in disbelief, "i can't believe it, i was sure this would work."  the fifth gangster looks at him exasperated and says, "dude, why the hell did you think this would work? what can five gangsters do against a dishwasher who's basically superman?"  the owner replies, "i know it sounded crazy and i had no evidence to prove it, but i really thought that 5gs could cause dish ease."	5

"i suppose the saw finally did him in." "no", says the nurse, "some dopey idiot put his head in a plastic bag and he suffocated	3

a family is at the dinner table. the son asks the father, “dad, how many kinds of boobs are there?” the father, surprised, answers, “well, son, a woman goes through three phases. in her 20s, a woman’s breasts are like melons, round and firm. in her 30s and 40s, they are like pears, still nice, hanging a bit. after 50, they are like onions.” “onions?” the son asks. “yes. you see them and they make you cry.” this infuriated his wife and daughter. the daughter asks, “mom, how many different kinds of willies are there?” the mother smiles and says, “well, dear, a man goes through three phases also. in his 20s, his willy is like an oak tree, mighty and hard. in his 30s and 40s, it’s like a birch, flexible but reliable. after his 50s, it’s like a christmas tree.” “a christmas tree?” the daughter asks. “yes, dead from the root up and the balls are just for decoration.”	4

buster the farting dog... a guy was at his girlfriend’s parents’ house, meeting them for the first time. he was understandably nervous, especially because he was trying desperately to hold in his gas.   at one point, shifting in his seat, he accidentally let one slip and it reverberated quite loudly on the leather chair. embarrassed beyond belief, he wasn’t sure what to say, when his girlfriend’s dad looked over and said “buster!!”  confused, he looked down & saw the family dog sitting next to him, wagging his tail. he realized the man must have thought it was the dog and chuckled a bit to himself. he even figured he might be able to get away with another so he squeezed one out.   sure enough, “c’mon buster!!” was the response. so now he figures he can fart as loud as he wants and they’ll all just assume it was the dog, so he unleashes all this gas he’s been holding in with a thundering “bwaaaaaaaaap!”  his girlfriend’s father looks back at the dog one last time and yells, “buster! get away from that guy before he craps all over you!”	1

a high school senior was preparing for his prom... he knew that the first thing he needed was a tuxedo. so he went to get a rental.   but his town was very small, and there was only one tux rental place nearby. therefore, when he arrived he had to wait for three of his classmates to pick out their rentals before he could get his. he waited in line for a while, and soon he got his tux.   next, he needed to rent a limo, because he loved his girlfriend and wanted to show up in style. but yet again, there was only one limo rental place in town and he had to wait in line. luckily, he was able to get the last limo in the lot and drove home.   the next day was his prom. he was very excited, and bumped his favorite songs in the limo as he drove to his girlfriends house to pick her up.   but his girlfriend, like all other girls, took an infinitely long time to get ready. he waited downstairs, making small talk with her father, and eventually she came down, looking as beautiful as ever. they embraced, said goodbye to her family, and headed off to prom.   when they got to the venue, they saw that unfortunately it only had one door, so they waited in a line that stretched around the block to get in. the wait was unbearable, but eventually they made it in to prom.   it was a great prom, and both of them were having the time of their lives. they danced so much that they began to get tired, and his girlfriend asked if he would please get the two of them some punch. so he headed over to the punch bowl,  and there was no punch line.	4

an american anthropologist is studying cultures throughout western africa. he discovers an isolated civilization in the west african jungle.  it’s a small village with wooden houses and plenty of domesticated animals.  the anthropologist is impressed by the organization of the village and becomes eager to learn more about the culture of it’s inhabitants.    he approaches a group of villagers and introduces himself.  they welcome him kindly and are very hospitable, offering him ethnical food and drinks of their culture.  to his surprise, the few hundreds of people of the village speak perfect english.    after hours of socializing with the villagers, he notices one of them walk off into the forest and disappear for a while and then return, seemingly exhausted.  curious about this behavior and if it has any cultural significance, he secretly follows the next villager that walks away.    after a mile of stalking the villager through the forest, he reaches a clearance.  he sees an organized line of villagers leading to a tall narrow wooden tower in the distance.  he watches as one villager climbs the side of the tower, sits on top of it, and stares off into the distance.  then after a while, the villager climbs back down and another climbs up to preform the same ritual.  the anthropologist becomes curious of this ritual and of the significance of the tower.  he believes it must be some sort of religious shrine and wants to get closer to inspect it.  he walks past the line of villagers and approaches the tower.  he explains to the next villager in line that he is vey interested in their culture and intrigued by the tower and that he would love to climb the tower next to see the view from the top.  the villager politely allows him to climb next so he grabs the wooden knobs that protrude from the outside wall of the tower and begins to climb.    upon reaching the top, he notices fecal matter all over the outside edges and a terrible aroma emanating from a large hole on the top surface.   he realizes that the villagers have been defecating in the hole on top and he is completely repulsed.  he immediately climbs back down as fast as he can in a state of disgust.    when he gets back to the bottom, he’s sweating and out of breathe from the climb.  the villagers ask him if he enjoyed himself and was pleased by the findings of his curious investigation.    “to be honest i’m quite underwhelmed.  i thought this tower was going to be something of more amusement and significance that i could share with my colleagues back home” stated the anthropologist.   “nope” replied a villager “it’s just a really long shitpost”	3

"was it nina capelli?"  "i'm sorry, but i cannot name her."  "was it cathy piriano?"  "my lips are sealed."  "was it rosa diangelo, then?"  "please, father, i cannot tell you."  the priest sighs in frustration. "you're very tight lipped, and i admire that. but you've sinned and have to atone. you cannot be an altar boy now for 4 months. now you go and behave yourself."  joey walks back to his pew, and his friend franco slides over and whispers, "what'd you get?"

a recent archeological dig has uncovered a set of 2300 year old roman gold rings, with a small golden figure of a tick attatched to it, missing all its legs... archeologists originally believed it to be simple wear and tear, until it was discovered there were no signs of soldering on the bodies of the golden ticks, indicating they were intentionally made legless. a professor on the scene theorized that these rings were a gesture of romantic interest or a primite form of an engagement ring, and the fleas having no legs most likely being a metaphoric gesture that one would never leave their partner, as fleas are infamous for being able to hop up to 200 times their body lenght, thus usually being very evasive.  said the professor: "for a lot of people, this gesture might seem surprisingly cheesy or immature, but... what else would you expect from those hop-less roman ticks?"	3

"so, jew, what do you want to swear on?"  "swear?", the rabbi asks, "why should i need to swear, do you think i played poker against myself?"	5

this is the only joke i know. spooktober appropriate. a cemetery caretaker is feeling ill after a long day's work and decides to head into town to get some medicine before going to bed.   it is still pretty light out and the drug store is only a few miles from his house on the graveyard property, so he decides the walk might do him some good.   unfortunately, it takes him a while to gather the medicines he thinks he might need and the checkout line is longer than normal. he buys some cold medicine, some pain killers and some cough drops for the next day.   when he is finally done, he heads home. it is now quite dark and a chill has set in so he is not in the best of spirits.   when he makes it back to the graveyard, a cloud passes in front of the moon. luckily he knows the graveyard well and can navigate it without a problem.   it's quiet and he hears a noise behind him.  thump thump thump  he looks around but can't see anything in the dark. he quickens his pace.  he hears the sound again, but louder.  thump thump thump  he is genuinely frightened now and starts to run.   the sound grows louder still.  ###thump thump thump  as he's running, he glances back and the moon emerges from behind the clouds. to his horror, he sees a coffin, standing on end, bounding towards him.  ##thump thump thump  he breaks into a sprint and slams the gate to his yard shut as he passes by. the coffin breaks through the gate, unhindered.   #thump thump thump  he slams the door to his house and frantically locks it. the coffin breaks down the door.  #thump thump thump  he scrambles to the end of the room and knocks a table over to block it's path. the coffin breaks through the table.  #thump thump thump  he cowers against the wall, sure that his fate is sealed. in a last ditch effort, he tosses the cough drops at it.   and the coffin stops.	5

on the outskirts of a small town, there was a big, old pecan tree just inside the cemetery fence. one day, two boys filled up a bucketful of nuts and sat down by the tree, out of sight, and began dividing the nuts. "one for you, one for me, one for you, one for me," said one boy. several dropped and rolled down toward the fence. another boy came riding along the road on his bicycle. as he passed, he thought he heard voices from inside the cemetery. he slowed down to investigate. sure enough, he heard, "one for you, one for me, one for you, one for me ...." he just knew what it was. he jumped back on his bike and rode off. just around the bend he met an old man with a cane, hobbling along. "come here quick," said the boy, "you won't believe what i heard! satan and the lord are down at the cemetery dividing up the souls!" the man said, "beat it kid, can't you see it's hard for me to walk." when the boy insisted though, the man hobbled slowly to the cemetery. standing by the fence they heard, "one for you, one for me. one for you, one for me." the old man whispered, "boy, you've been tellin' me the truth. let's see if we can see the lord...?" shaking with fear, they peered through the fence, yet were still unable to see anything. the old man and the boy gripped the wrought iron bars of the fence tighter and tighter as they tried to get a glimpse of the lord. at last they heard, "one for you, one for me. that's all. now let's go get those nuts by the fence and we'll be done...." they say the old man had the lead for a good half-mile before the kid on the bike passed him.	4

the tale of the blond horse back rider.   a young blonde woman decides to try horseback riding, even though she has had no lessons or prior experience. she mounts the horse unassisted and the horse immediately springs into action.  as it gallops along at a steady and rhythmic pace, the blonde begins to slip from the saddle. in terror, she grabs for the horse's mane, but cannot get a firm grip. she tries to throw her arms around the horse's neck, but she slides down the side of the horse anyway!  the horse gallops along, seemingly oblivious of its slipping rider. finally, losing her frail grip, the blonde attempts to leap away from the horse and throw herself to safety.  unfortunately, her foot becomes entangled in the stirrup, and she is now at the mercy of the horse's pounding hooves as her head is struck against the ground over and over and over.  as her head is battered against the ground and she is mere moments away from unconsciousness, to her great fortune, frank the walmart greeter, sees her and unplugs the horse.	4

"hey," says dan, "where's al and ben?"  "it's a sad story," pretends carl. "yesterday, when al returned home, he found ben in bed with his wife. he was so angry at them that he shot and killed them both. then, realizing what he had done, he shot and killed himself."  as usual, dan responds, "could be worse!"  carl is nothing short of shocked. "what?!" he sputters. "he killed his friend, his wife, and himself! how could it be worse?"  "well," says dan, "had he returned home a day early, i'd be dead by now."	5

the pastor asked if anyone in the congregation would like to express praise for an answered prayer. suzie stood and walked to the podium. she said, "i have some praise. two months ago, my husband, frank, had a terrible bicycle accident and his scrotum was completely crushed. the pain was excruciating and the doctors didn't know if they could help him."  you could hear a muffled gasp from the men in the congregation as they imagined the pain that poor frank must have experienced.  "frank was unable to hold me or the children," she went on, "and every move caused him terrible pain."  we prayed as the doctors performed a delicate operation, and it turned out they were able to piece together the crushed remnants of frank's scrotum, and wrap wire around it to hold it in place with metal staples." again, the men in the congregation cringed and squirmed uncomfortably as they imagined the horrible surgery performed on  frank."now," she announced in a quivering voice, "thank the lord, frank is out of the hospital and the doctors say that with time, his scrotum should recover completely."  all the men sighed with unified relief. the pastor rose and tentatively asked if anyone else had something to say.  a man stood up and walked slowly to the podium. he said, "i'm frank." the entire congregation held its breath. "i just want to tell my wife that the word is sternum."	3

"i got me a two brother, mate. we used to get together and order one glass of whiskey for each of us every saturday since we were old enough to drink. now they are in another country, so i'm drinking for all of us."  after that, man drinks his whiskey and leaves. same as always.   after couple of weeks, the man comes to the bar, but this time, he orders two glasses of whiskey. bartender gets curious again and asks:  "i hope nothing happened to one of your brothers."  "no mate they are ok." says the man.   "i just quit drinking"	4

"no", says my wife. pygmy is what you have under your skin, it causes freckles. "that's pigment", i say. so she says "no, pigment is what the ancient romans were writing on." i sigh and say: "no, that's parchment!". "no", says she, "parchment is an unfinished sentence". "your honor, you can imagine, i swallowed the 'fragment', i got back to my armchair and my newspaper. but then suddenly she's back with a book, and she says:  i should know, i got a legionnaire for my french lessons. i say: "you mean a lector". "no", says my wife, "lector was an ancient greek hero." i say: "that was hector, and he was a trojan." "nope", says she, "hector is a measure of area." "that'd be hectare" "no! hectare is the drink of the gods!" "that'd be nectar". "no", says she, "the nectar is a river in southern germany." so i say: "that's the neckar." she says: "no, i must know, there's even a song about it. i recently sung it in a duo with my friend" i say: "it's a duet" she replies, "no, that's when two men are fighting with a saber." "that's a duel", i say. "no, a duel is where a railway goes through a mountain!" well, your honor, so i took a hammer and beat her to death... there was a long silence, shocked faces.  finally the judge says: not guilty. i would have killed her at "hector".	4

a horse and a chick are playing in a meadow... after a time, the horse gets stuck in the mud. frantic, he tells the chick to run to the farm and get the farmer to pull him out.   the chick runs as fast as her little legs will carry her and reaches the farm to find the farmer is nowhere to be seen. she finds an open window into the farmhouse and frantically searches for a way to save her equine friend. at this point, she notices the keys to the farmer's shiny bmw. she gets the keys, drives to the meadow and tows the horse to freedom. the horse is eternally grateful.  the next day, they are playing in the meadow again and the chick gets stuck in a different patch of mud. "quick," she cries, "go get the bmw and save me!" the horse thinks for a minute and says "i have a better idea," so he stands over the chick and thinks of erotic equine fantasies before asking the chick to hold on whilst he drags her to safety. the chick is perturbed, but eternally grateful.   what's the moral of the story? when you're hung like a horse, you don't need a bmw to pick up chicks.	1

donald trump met with the queen of england    he asked her, "your majesty, how do you run such an efficient government? are there any tips you can give me?"  "well," replied the queen, "the most important thing is to surround yourself with intelligent people."  trump frowned, and then asked, "but how do i know the people around you are really intelligent?"  the queen took a sip of tea. "oh, that's easy; you just ask them to answer an intelligent riddle."  the queen pushed a button on her intercom. "please send boris johnson in here, would you?"  the prime minister walked into the room and said, "yes, your majesty?"  the queen smiled and said, "answer me this, if you would, boris. your mother and father have a child. it is not your brother and it is not your sister. who is it?"  without pausing for a moment, he answered, "that would be me."  "yes! very good," said the queen.  trump went back home to ask mike pence the same question. “ mike, answer this for me. your mother and your father have a child. it's not your brother and it's not your sister. who is it?"  "i'm not sure," said pence. "let me get back to you on that one." he went to his advisers and asked everyone, but none could give him an answer.  finally, pence ran into his friend jack murphy in a restaurant the next night. pence asked, "jack, can you answer this for me? your mother and father have a child and it's not your brother or your sister. who is it?"  jack murphy answered right back, "that's easy, it's me!"  pence smiled, and said, "thanks!"  pence then went back to speak with trump. "say, i did some research and i have the answer to that riddle: it's my friend jack murphy!"  trump got up, stomped over to pence, and angrily yelled, "no, you idiot! it's boris johnson!"	5

an indian who was too modern was elected as chief of the tribe fall was upon this remote reservation when the tribe asked their new chief what the coming winter was going to be like. the modern day chief had never been taught the secrets of the ancients. when he looked at the sky he couldn't tell what the winter was going to be like.     better safe than sorry, he said to himself and told his tribe that the winter was indeed expected to be cold and that the members of the village should stock up on firewood to be prepared.      after several days, our modern chief got an idea. he went to the phone booth, called the national weather service and asked, "is the coming winter going to be cold?"     "it looks like this winter is going to be quite cold," the meteorologist at the weather service responded.     so the chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more firewood in order to be prepared. a week later he called the national weather service again. "does it still look like it is going to be a very cold winter?"     "yes," the man at national weather service again replied, "it's going to be a very cold winter."     the chief again went back to his people and ordered them to collect every scrap of firewood they could find. two weeks later the chief called the national weather service again. "are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?"     "absolutely," the man replied. "it's looking more and more like it is going to be one of the coldest winters ever."     "how can you be so sure?" the chief asked.     the weatherman replied, "the indians are collecting firewood like crazy."	5

superhero nude beach before i write the joke, i wanted to give credit to who it came from. i worked as a reporter very briefly, and we had an older fella that would always tell us one joke a day. he was a great guy and i just wanted to pass on one of his jokes that always stood out to me, so here it is.  if you were to ask who the fastest superhero is, there are a few that come to mind. realistically, the flash, fastest man alive, is your guy.  well, superheroes are like us, they get stressed and overworked too. so, they all have different ways of unwinding and decompressing.  well, flash decides to go to the beach, but this isn’t just any beach, this is a nude beach.  as he is walking around, he sees some friends from his universe and others as well. hawk girl playing volleyball, cheating of course because she can fly, her big ol’ tits smacking around. he sees the hulk walking, footprints behind him with a thick line in the sand between them.  trying to divert his gaze, he looks down toward the end of the beach and sees the most stunning creature ever, wonder woman. she is just laying there, sunglasses on, ignoring everything, just sprawled out.  “man, what i wouldn’t do to have sex with a woman like that...” flash says to himself. after a moment of humoring the thought, he thinks, “i mean, i am the fastest man alive... i could go over there, do whatever i want, then leave before anyone knew anything...”  hyping himself up before he could second guess himself, flash darts over to wonder woman, does his business and then leaves in a flash chuckling to himself. “i just had sex with wonder woman!”  in the burst of air that passes as he disappears, wonder woman props herself up on her elbows, takes her sunglasses off, and fixes her hair as she looks around. confused, she asks, “what in the world was that?”  meanwhile, the invisible man on top of her replies, “i don’t know, but my ass sure hurts.”	3

jesus and satan were arguing over whom should be able to walk the earth... god stepped in and told both of them to draft a detailed, 7 page, 10 font, mla format, report as to why they deserve it.  he gave them 1 day to complete the report.   as they both were furiously typing and conducting web searches, and citing away, the final hour was upon them.  all of the sudden, god sneezes and the power goes out.  when he returns the power, they are both becoming frantic.    as the hour closes, satan is even more red than ever.  he complains that god did it on purpose and that they need another dau, because he lost all of his work.  as god allows him to continue his tirade, jesus walks over and hands his completed report to god.  satan sees this and exclaims that jesus was cheating.  god just looks at him and says, "no, jesus saves."	3
i recall the time years ago when my friend and i went on our secret spy mission. like any other highly trained operatives, we were tasked with infiltrating the local mattress store. it had been reported several times for housing a suspicious number of fans. (a code 182).   per our orders, my partner and i snuck into the establishment, taking up hiding under the blankets of some nearby display beds. sure enough, the place was crawling with fans: ceiling fans, upright fans, and worst of all, those folding paper fans. frankly, it was terrifying, but our nerves were steeled from years of spy training. remaining calm we stayed hidden under the blankets gathering intel.  but suddenly, from out of nowhere, i could hear my partner shout in horror and run past my hiding spot towards the store’s exit.  i feared the worst. was he okay? had a fan discovered his location? frightened and confused by his hasty escape, i contacted him through my earpiece. “what’s wrong?! why didn’t you stay in your bed?!”  panting in fear, he responded. “my cover’s been blown!”	2

[long]so, a pianist walks into his local jazz bar... as he's been down on his luck and is looking for work. he asks one of the waitresses there to speak to the manager, who he approaches and asks,   "are you the dumb fucker that runs this shit hole of a bar?"   the manager, taken very much aback, responds, "excuse me? i am the manager, yes, can you please stop swearing in front of my patrons?"  "good! 'cause i need some fucking work and i'm half decent on the keys!"   and he sits down and begins to play the sweetest, grooviest, bluest-of-blues tracks the bar manager has ever heard.   "d..did you write that? that was beautiful! what's it called?"   "that i did! it's called, why don't you go fuck the ass off of a low flying duck you insolent cunt?"   aghast, the manager gestures for the pianist to hush, and quietly asks "do you know any jazz? anything a little more intricate?"   "'course i do!"   and again the pianist plays the most delightful and devilish jazz piece the manager has heard.   bracing for the name of this track, he asks "well what do you call it?"   "i'll fuck your mother's hairy minge under the cover of pale moonlight!"   appalled, though aware of the man's talents, the manager offers him a spot on the bill, on the proviso that he doesn't name his songs after he plays them, and the pianist happily agrees.   *later that evening...*   about 5 from showtime, the pianist has set himself up on stage and is perusing the crowd, gauging the energy of the room, when he suddenly spies the most beautiful, drop-dead gorgeous woman he's ever seen - tight fitting red dress with red lipstick to match, high heels - you name it. after slight deliberation, and with the 5 minutes to spare, the pianist decides it a good idea to go try rub one out in the men's room, to "deal with the stress of performing", as he justifies it.   well, lo and behold it takes a little longer than 5 minutes, and the manager comes bursting into the bathroom (on the other side of the stall, mind you), and yells  "christ mate, where have you been?! the people are getting agitated - you've a show to play! don't you fuck this up for me!"  before leaving the bathroom abrutply.   the pianist rages on with the task at hand, and after wrapping up he bursts from the bathroom back onto the stage and sets right to playing.   after his first song, the lovely woman he had spied earlier approaches him from the side of the stage, leans into his ear and whispers   "excuse me, do you know your dick is hanging out of your pants and there's cum dribbling onto your shoe?"  stunned, the pianist turns to her and says   "know it?! i wrote that fucking song!"	3

there was this businessman who was getting ready to go on a long business trip. he knew his wife was a flirtatious sort, so he thought he'd try to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn't much like the idea of her screwing someone else. so he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. he thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. he was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. he explained his situation. the old man said, "well, i don't really know of anything that will do the trick. we have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but i don't know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except.... and he stopped.   “except what?" the man asked.   “nothing, nothing."   “c'mon, tell me! i need something!"   "well, sir, i don't usually mention this, but there is the 'voodoo dick.'"   “so what's up with this voodoo dick?" he asked.  the old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. he opened it and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo.   the businessman laughed, and said "big fucking deal. it looks like every other dildo in this shop!"   the old man replied, "but you haven't seen what it'll do yet." he pointed to a door and said "voodoo dick, the door." the voodoo dick rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. the whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. before the door could split, the old man said "voodoo dick, get back in your box!" the voodoo dick stopped, floated back to the box and lay there quiescent once more.   "i'll take it!" said the businessman. the old man resisted, saying it wasn't for sale, but he finally surrendered to $700 in cash.   the guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say "voodoo dick, my pussy." he left for his trip satisfied that things would be fine while he was gone.  after he'd been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. she thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dick.   she got it out, and said "voodoo dick, my pussy!" the voodoo dick shot to her crotch and started pumping. it was great, like nothing she'd ever experienced before. after three orgasms, she decided she'd had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. she tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. her husband had forgotten to tell her how to shut it off.   so she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. she put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. on the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. he asked for her license, and then asked how much she'd had to drink. gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn't been drinking, but that a voodoo dick was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn't stop screwing.  the officer looked at her for a second, and then said "yeah, right.. voodoo dick, my ass!"	2

donald trump walks into a catholic church. he turns to the altar boy and asks  “where’s that box where i proclaim all the fucked up shit i’ve done lately”  the altar boy, stunned to see the president in his church, directs trump to the confession box. trump steps inside and the altar boy realizes the priest is nowhere to be found. to not keep the *president* waiting, he enters the other side himself.   immediately trump begins speaking a flurry of horrible sins.   “this week i grabbed a dozen women by the pussy, stole millions of dollars via fraud and tax evasion, and purposefully escalated the threat of nuclear warfare with north korea.”  not knowing how to respond to sins of this magnitude, the altar boy slips out of the box to look for the priest. he finds him coming back from lunch.   “father, donald trump is here and he’s in the confession box spouting some of the most horrible things i’ve ever heard! what do we do?”  “grab a mop” says the priest.   “why would we do that” asks the altar boy.   “this happens once a week” says the priest. “donald’s not confessing he’s just reading his tweets out loud as he writes them”  “oh” says the altar boy. “so why the mop?”  the priest sighs and says “donald only tweets on the toilet”.	5
husband and wife are putting up holiday decorations when husband offers to hang the wreath. “but sweetums, you are inept and you have no tools,” says the wife. husband shrugs and goes to lowe’s to buy a hammer. he walks past a display for the new, elf steam multi-tool. the marketing was brilliant and it had a drill, three saws, and a sander - all working on steam power. he buys the tool hoping his wife will finally have confidence in his abilities.   when he gets home and hangs the wreath, he puts a hole in the wall, knocks over the bookcase and raises the ire of his wife. “take that stupid tool back. i will ask my father to put up the wreath.” the man shrugs, “aww honey, i can do the job. the new tool is defective.” so he goes back to lowe’s and instead of getting a different tool, is talked into replacing it with an upgraded elf steam. great marketing.   the man gets home and creates more disaster with the tool. he breaks a window, gouges the floor, scares the cat who knocks over the christmas tree, and his wife is enraged. “you fool! take that elf steam back. my dad will be here after dinner to clean up your disaster!”   the sulking man drives back to lowe’s, returns it and goes across the street to the home depot. yet again he is convinced to purchase another elf steam.   but this time when he gets home, thanks to the new tool, he fixes the holes in the wall, replaces the window, hangs the wreath, refinishes the floor, puts up the tree, grooms the cat, builds new bookshelves, all in one day. the man feels unstoppable. his wife is so proud. his father-in-law is impressed.   next day, the man goes to home depot and asks the tool department manager why he was suddenly confident and successful. “obviously,” said the man, “you had lowe’s elf steam.”	4

"serpents! why has thou not done as i have commanded, and gone forth to multiply?"  "behold, we are adders and so cannot multiply," the snakes mournfully replied.  and so noah bade his sons to hew great trees from the mountain, and from the raw trees to construct a mighty platform, 70 cubits long and 40 cubits wide and 20 cubits tall. and when the construction was finished noah stood upon it and proclaimed to the snakes.  "adders, behold! a table of logs, with which you may multiply by adding."	5

a couple attending an art exhibition at the national gallery were staring at a portrait that had them totally confused. the painting depicted three black men totally naked, sitting on a park bench. two of the men had black penises, but the one seated in the middle had a pink penis. the curator of the gallery realized the confused couple were having trouble with interpreting the painting and offered his assessment. he went on and on for nearly half an hour explaining how it depicted the sexual emasculation of african-americans in a predominantly white, patriarchal society. “in fact”, he pointed out, “some serious critics believe that the pink penis reflects the cultural and sociological oppression expressed by gay men in a contemporary society”.  after the curator left, a scotsman man approached the couple and said, “would you like to know what the painting is really about?”  “now why would you claim to be more of an expert than the curator of the gallery?” asked the couple.  “because i’m the guy who painted it,” he replied. “in fact, there is no african-american representation at all. they’re just three scottish coal-miners. the guy in the middle went home for lunch.”	4

"oh, i don't know," said the stranger. "how about nuclear power?"   "ok," said little johnny. "that could be an interesting topic. but let me ask you a question first."   "a horse, a cow, and a deer all eat grass. the same stuff. yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. why do you suppose that is?"   "jeez," said the stranger. "i have no idea."   "well, then," said little johnny, "how is it that you feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don't know shit?"	5

the preacher and the ghost. a new preacher wanted to rent a house in the country but the only one available was rumored to be haunted. that didn’t bother the preacher since he didn’t believe in such things. he went ahead and rented the place.  soon the ghost made its appearance. the preacher told his friends about the ghost, but they didn’t believe him. they told him the only way they would believe was if he took a picture of the ghost.  the preacher went home and called for the ghost. when it appeared, the preacher explained the situation and asked the ghost if it would mind having its picture taken. the ghost agreed.  when the picture was developed, the ghost wasn’t visible. feeling disappointed, the preacher called again for the ghost. when it appeared, the preacher showed it the picture and wanted to know why the ghost wasn’t in it.  the ghost thought a minute and replied, “well, i guess the spirit was willing, but the flash was weak.”	2

a woman was at her hairdresser's getting her hair styled for a trip to rome with her husband. she mentioned the trip to the hairdresser, who responded:  "rome? why would anyone want to go there? it's crowded and dirty. you're crazy to go to rome. so, how are you getting there?”  "we're taking united” was the reply. "we got a great rate!”  “united?" exclaimed the hairdresser. " that's a terrible airline. their planes are old, their flight attendants are ugly, and they're always late. so, where are you staying in rome?”  "we'll be at this exclusive little place over on rome's tiber river called taste.”  "don't go any further. i know that place. everybody thinks it's gonna be something special and exclusive, but it's really a dump.”  "we're going to go to see the vatican and maybe get to see the pope.”  "that's rich," laughed the hairdresser. ”you and a million other people trying to see him. he'll look the size of an ant. boy, good luck on this lousy trip of yours. you're going to need it.”  a month later, the woman again came in for a hairdo. the hairdresser asked her about her trip to rome.  "it was wonderful," explained the woman, "not only were we on time in one of united’s brand new planes, but it was overbooked, and they bumped us up to first class. the food and wine were wonderful, and we had a handsome 28-year-old steward who waited on us hand and foot..  and the taste hotel was great! they'd just finished a $5 million remodeling, and now it's a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. they, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!”  "well," muttered the hairdresser, "that's all well and good, but i know you didn't get to see the pope.”  "actually, we were quite lucky, because as we toured the vatican, a swiss guard tapped me on the shoulder, and explained that the pope likes to meet some of the visitors, and if i'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the pope would personally greet us.  sure enough, five minutes later, the pope walked through the door and shook my hand! i knelt down and he spoke a few words to me..”  "oh, really! what'd he say?”  he said: "who fucked up your hair?	5

my favorite engineering joke (thinking like an engineer) a threesome is playing golf on a very nice golf course; a preacher, a doctor and an engineer.  they're moving along really slow because the foursome in front of them is playing too slow.  they catch up to one of the caddies from the foursome and ask him, "hey can we play through?"  the caddie says, "yeah sure, sorry.  they're blind so it takes them a long time to find their balls.  we play with little beeping balls, but it still takes a while for them to find them and get set up,  you can see why this would be slow."  the preacher says, "woah, son, i commend you for your patience.  i think it's good work you are doing out here.  i'm going to go back to my congregation, and i'm going to ask all of my flock to pray to the lord that these people might be healed!"  "thank you, preacher, that's mighty kind"  the doctor hearing this starts to speak, "hey caddie, i'm a doctor, so why don't you give me some contacts for these guys. i know quite a few specialists, and maybe we can see if there's something we can do to help their eyesight?"  "that would be wonderful, doc!"  the engineer sitting there thoughtfully listening to his friend the doctor, and his other friend the preacher figures he ought to say something and try to help too.  "why don't they just play at night?"	4

"no, i'm afraid cauliflower won't work. two heads of broccoli, please."  the greengrocer is confused. "ma'am, as i already said, we don't *have* any broccoli. we sold the last of it this morning. would you be interested in a nice cabbage, or some green beans?"  "no, i don't want cabbage or green beans. i *need* two heads of broccoli. you must have *some* left."  annoyed now, the greengrocer repeats that there is no broccoli to be had. again, he is ignored by the persistent woman who insists that he produce some. then, the grocer gets an idea.

a teenage son and his father are sitting at a restaurant... when in walks another teenager with colored hair. the father is intently staring down the kid with the colored hair, enough so that it makes his teenage son uncomfortable. the stare down continues while the kid with the colored hair orders his food and heads to a table. while walking by, the kid and father make eye contact. "what are you looking at, old man?" the colored haired kid asks the father. "let it go, dad..." the father's son says, sinking further into his seat. "well..." the father says, pausing to take a sip of his coffee "about twenty years ago, i got drunk and fucked a peacock, and i was wondering if you were mine."	2

the girlfriend joke now, i need to caveat the beginning of this joke with some information. i'm a solid six-outta-ten, a real average looking guy. never been too smooth wirth the ladies but whaddaya do, never been lonely neither. so, one day i come home from work, i live in a little apartment complex, and i see across the hall is this nine-outta-ten girl, hauling boxes into her new place. so i, like the curious neighbor i am, walk up and ask "hey, can i give you a hand with those boxes?" and inthe snootiest, whitest white girl voice i've ever heard she says "uhm, no thanks, creep!" so i walk off, defeated and dejected, and settle in for a night of video games, good pizza and generally a snazzy ol' time. the next morning, as i'm walking out of my house and locking the door, i hear a much calmer version of the same white girl voice i heard just before, and to protect her identity, i'm just gonna call her nine.  nine says to me, "i'm so sorry for the way i treated you last night, moving into a new place is so stressful i took it out on you and i shouldn't have done that." "not a problem, sometimes it be like that," i respond. "can i take you out for dinner tonight as an apology?" she's starting to get really flirty at this point. score! "on one condition, you let me pay, and i take you to a movie as well." i'm in the clear now!   so nine and i date for a few weeks and it's going awesomely, she's super hot, she's really sweet and we get busy doing all sorts of stuff you do in the secrecy of your own home with the person you love. like our taxes.   and then, not too long later, and new girl moves in, one door opposite me. a decent seven-outta-ten, not super hot like nine, but still cute. so i see her moving boxes the same way and offer to help, and she gladly accepts. she directs me to bring a loosely-taped, very old worn-down looking box to the living room, and so i do. i plop the box - carefully - onto the floor, and notice it's full of old 90's era video games, complete woth a snes and a nes, really cool stuff, basically. so i casually ask her "is that your boyfriends'box of games", and she cheerily tells me no. she's an avid gamer, and a major collector of 90's nostalgia. primo cool stuff, and we form a fast friendship.  so life is great for a few months, nines and i spend tons of time together, madly in love, and seven is my new best friend. until, one day, nines tells me that she's starting to become really jealous of seven, which, to be fair, is entirely understandable. if i'm not with one i'm with the other, and i can see how she might think something is going on. so i tell her to spend some time with seven, if she likes me, she'll love seven, and hopefully they can become fast friends too.  then it gets weird, nines tells me that while they were hanging out, seven threatened to kill her, if she didn't stop seeing me. and nines is fucking scared man, like, she thinks seven might actually do something about it. but it's late, so i tell her i'll talk to seven in the morning.  morning comes, i knock on seven's door. no answer. text seven, no answer. call her, no answer. nine's door. text. call. nothing.  so i think maybe they're at work already - or run off to start their own secret romance?  i come home from work, haven't heard from either of them. i'm ghosted for weeks.  and then, i see her. seven, on the news. covered in blood. she looks straight into the camera. "she's dead, you're next." cut to a shot of an anchorman, talking about how a woman was murdered. bites taken out of her flesh.  she's dead, you're next.  they autopsy the body, murder. it was nines. parts of her had been eaten.  she's dead, you're next.  nines is dead. i'm next.  so it begs the question, why was six afraid of seven? because seven ate nine.	3
a priest, a rabbi, and a baptist preacher were out fishing together "we should all confess our sins," the priest suggests. "give it a shot and see how it feels."  the three agree, and the catholic goes goes first. "i'm an alcoholic. i drink till i black out every night."  "i love watching naked women on the internet," the rabbi confesses. "i just can't seem to stop."  the baptist starts cracking up laughing, and the other two ask him what's so funny.  "well my sin is i love to gossip," the baptist said, "and i can't wait till we get back to shore."	5

a king was fed up by the constant jokes about the men in his kingdom being afraid of their wives. he wanted to find a man who wasn't afraid of his wife and give him public honors and lavish him with gifts so other men may follow suit.   after some brainstorming in the court the king announced to his subjects that " if a man comes forward and publically say that he is not afraid of his wife, then that man will win the best horse from the king's stables".  the king waited with with baited breath for someone to come forward. days passed but nobody came forward. the king was about to lose all hope then suddenly a man came in his court saying that "he was not afraid of his wife".  the king was over the moon thinking that there is indeed a real man in his kingdom. he called all his subjects in a big field and introduced them to the man who was definitely not afraid of his wife. everyone applauded in awe as king presented him with the best red horse in his stable.   the man disappointingly looked at the horse. the king was confused. "what is it? you don't like the horse? "  the man replied, " actually, if you don't mind your highness, my wife asked me to bring a white horse "	3

an irish whaler (long) there was once an irish whaler.  like ahab, he had a particular nemesis whom he had hunted most of his life.  old and gnarled, he declared one more quest to vanquish his foe before descending into his mother earth.  unlike ahab however, revenge was not his only motive.  this particular whale also possessed two commodities of mythical, almost mystical qualities.  the first was its oil.  whale blubber is known to produce remarkable oils, and this whale's oil burned for years, even decades.  also prized was its meat.  when butchered a specific way with a gaff (a hook like instrument used to retrieve items or fish), this "beef" was perfectly marbled and produced an aphrodisiac effect, being easily the most prized meat in the world.  so our hero set out on his final quest.  with a storm brewing on the horizon, it was not long before he sighted his quarry and, miraculously, was able to maneuver his ship stealthily along side the beast.  heaving his harpoon, it sunk deep in to the fleshy bowels of the creature.  mighty this whale was though, and it would not be brought down.  it dragged his vessel for leagues, eventually in to the heart of the storm.  our irish sailor persisted, trying every trick to bring down his nemesis, but to no avail.  the whale heaved his ship through the storm, battering it with waves and weather until it was barely seaworthy.  at last, the ship almost ready to plunge into the depths, the leviathan double backed and vaulted its mighty form into the air, seeking to crush the ship in a single, final blow.  upon seeing his enemy descend upon him, the irishman looked heavenward and repeated the object of his quest in his thick accent: "whale oil. beef, hooked."	3

a us senator is tragically hit by a truck and dies... while walking down the street one day a us senator is tragically hit by a truck and dies. his soul arrives in heaven and is met by st. peter at the entrance. "welcome to heaven," says st. peter. “what we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven. then you can choose where to spend eternity."  &#x200b;  "really, i've made up my mind. i want to be in heaven," says the senator. "i'm sorry, but we have our rules."  &#x200b;  and with that, st. peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. the doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a green golf course. in the distance is a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him. everyone is very happy and in evening dress. they run to greet him, shake his hand, and reminisce about the good times they had while getting rich at the expense of the people. they play a friendly game of golf and then dine on lobster, caviar and champagne.  &#x200b;  also present is the devil, who really is a very friendly guy who has a good time dancing and telling jokes. they are having such a good time that before he realizes it, it is time to go. everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises... the elevator goes up, up, up and the door reopens on heaven where st. peter is waiting for him.  &#x200b;  "now it's time to visit heaven." so, 24 hours pass with the senator joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud, playing the harp and singing. they have a good time and, before he realizes it, the 24 hours have gone by and st. peter returns.  &#x200b;  "well, then, you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven. now choose your eternity." the senator reflects for a minute, then he answers: "well, i would never have said it before, i mean heaven has been delightful, but i think i would be better off in hell."  &#x200b;  so st. peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down, down to hell. now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage. he sees all his friends, dressed in rags, picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above. the devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulder.  &#x200b;  "i don't understand," stammers the senator. "yesterday i was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse, and we ate lobster and caviar, drank champagne, and danced and had a great time. now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable. what happened?"  &#x200b;  the devil looks at him, smiles and says, "yesterday we were campaigning...... today you voted."	5

a church has a job opening for.. a bell ringer. so they posted the position and a man came in with no arms wanting the job. the clergy weren't sure he could do it, but he convinced them to let him try it.  they climbed the bell tower and the guy ran toward the bell and hit it with his head. they gave him the job.  the next day he went to ring the bell, tripped, bounced off the bell and fell to the sidewalk below dead.  two guys were walking past.  one asked, "do you know this guy?"  the second guy responded, "no, but his face rings a bell."   the next day, the dead bell ringer's twin brother comes in for the again vacant bell ringer position.   he also has no arms. they lead him up to the bell tower, he runs at the bell, trips and falls to the sidewalk below.  the same two guys walk by.  the first asks, "do you know him?"  the second guy responds, "no, but he's a dead ringer for the guy we saw yesterday."	4
a team of british archaeologists dug to a depth of 15 feet and found an intricate network of copper wires. from this, the team concluded that the britain was advanced enough to have telephone connections in their cities 150 years ago.  in response to this, american archaeologists started their own expedition. they dug up to a depth of 20 feet and found an even more expansive network of copper wires. from this discovery, they concluded that america was advanced enough 200 years ago to have telephone connections in all their towns and cities.  not to be outdone by their old enemies, the russians formed a crack team of their own archaeologists and sent them to dig in siberia. they dug to a depth of 25 feet and found absolutely nothing beneath the ice and snow. from this, they concluded that they were so far ahead of the british and americans that 250 years ago, they had wireless coverage not only in their cities but even in the remotest part of their country.	4

jane and arlene are outside their nursing home, having a drink and a smoke, when it starts to rain. jane pulls out a condom, cuts off the end, puts it over her cigarette, and continues smoking arlene: what in the hell is that? jane: a condom. this way my cigarette doesn't get wet. arlene: where did you get it? jane: you can get them at any pharmacy. the next day, arlene hobbles herself into the local pharmacy and announces to the pharmacist that she wants a box of condoms. the pharmacist, obviously embarrassed, looks at her kind of strangely (she is, after all, over 80 years of age), but very delicately asks what size, texture, brand of condom she prefers. 'doesn't matter sonny, as long as it fits on a camel.'	5

student: can i borrow a pencil? **teacher:** i don't know, can you borrow a pencil?  **student:** aha, but i clearly meant to ask for permission. since you and the rest of the class understood my intent perfectly well, and the word "may" to show permission is rapidly falling out of fashion, there is nothing wrong with asking you whether i can borrow a pencil.  **teacher:** possibly so, in colloquial speech. discerning context can help us decipher the nuance of each sentence on a case-by-case basis. however, as your teacher, my task is to teach you the intricacies and nuances of the english language with rigor, so that you may have a greater mastery of the language in order to effectively and precisely control what you want to communicate. in this case, the difference between the words "can" and "may".  **student:** point taken. may i borrow a pencil?  **teacher:** no, you may not. the state cut funding for education again.	5

twins a man was driving along the highway, and saw a rabbit hopping across the middle of the road. he swerved to avoid hitting the rabbit, but unfortunately the rabbit jumped in front of the car and was hit. the driver, being a sensitive man as well as an animal lover, pulled over to the side of the road and got out to see what had become of the rabbit. much to his dismay, the rabbit was dead. the driver felt so awful he began to cry. a woman driving down the highway saw the man crying on the side of the road and pulled over. she stepped out of her car and asked the man what was wrong. "i feel terrible," he explained. "i accidently hit this rabbit and killed it."    the woman told the man not to worry. she knew what to do. she went to her car trunk and pulled out a spray can. she walked over to the limp, dead rabbit, and sprayed the contents of the can onto the rabbit. miraculously, the rabbit came to life, jumped up, waved its paw at the two humans and hopped down the road. 50 feet away the rabbit stopped, turned around, waved at the two again, hopped down the road another 50 feet, turned, waved, and hopped another 50 feet. the man was astonished. he couldn't figure out what substance could be in the woman's spray can! he ran over to the woman and demanded, " what was in your spray can? what did you spray onto that rabbit?" the woman turned the can around so that the man could read the label. it said: "'hare spray' restores life to dead hare. adds permanent wave."	1

a new pastor was visiting the homes of his parishioners. at one house it seemed obvious that someone was at home, but no answer came to his repeated knocks at the door. therefore, he took out a card and wrote "revelation 3:20" on the back of it and stuck it in the door. when the offering was processed the following sunday, he found that his card had been returned. added to it was this cryptic message, genesis 3:10." reaching for his bible to check out the citation, he broke up in gales of laughter. revelation 3:20 begins "behold, i stand at the door and knock." genesis 3:10 reads, "i heard your voice in the garden and i was afraid, for i was naked."	3

she’s from minsk a small, tight knit, russian village buys their milk from the neighboring town. eventually they realize they should pool their resources and buy a cow for the town.   they all gather their money, some put more, some less, whatever they can afford. now they have 800 roubles, but to buy a cow from moscow a cow costs 900 roubles, but a cow from minsk, costs 700 roubles. so off to minsk the town elders go. they return with a great cow.   the cow produces plenty of milk for the whole town, and everyone is happy and well nourished! they even sell the excess to the neighboring town.   the town  loves the cow and want to breed her and have so her calves will nourish the village.   so off to market the village elders go again, and they bring back a prize bull to mate with the cow.   they put them together in a beautiful pasture and the bull approaches the cow, but the cow moves away, and is not interested. the bull tries again from a different angle but still the cow rebuffs him. for hours the bull tries to mount the cow at the top of the field, the bottom of the field and the middle of the field but to no avail.   the town elders do not know what to do, so they call a local rabbi to help them with their problem.   they explain their story to the rabbi, they tell him all the details and ask him what to do.   the rabbi thinks for a while, he strokes his beard. then asks the elders a question.   “your cow, is she from minsk?”  the elders are amazed! “amazing!! you are truly a wise rabbi. how did you know she is from minsk?!”  and the rabbi replies,   “ahhh, well my... wife, she is from minsk also…”	3

abomination! a recently ordained irish priest was traveling to his new parish. as he drove down the lane, he saw a man in a ditch screwing a sheep. the young priest shuddered, offering a prayer, and crossed himself.  a few miles down the road he saw another man in the fields also boffing a sheep. appalled at having witnessed a second case of bestiality in less than an hour, he whispered several prayers, crossed himself fervently, and drove on.  not much further down the country road, on the outskirts of town, the new priest spotted a man leaning against a tree and masturbating enthusiastically. then and there, he decided grimly on the topic of his first sermon.  "as i approached this fair town," he began that sunday, "i witnessed three abominations. first, on the roadside, i saw a man committing an unnatural act with a sheep! shortly thereafter was another man in a field committing the same vile act with a sheep! and third, at the very outskirts of this town, a man was committing an abomination with himself!"  a voice spoke up from the congregation. "aye, that'll be old abe boninsky. he never could catch a sheep."	2

"all right" he said, "here's a whip, a chair and a gun. let's see what you can do with big leo over there. we'll let you have the first try, miss, but be careful- he's a mean one."  the ravishing redhead strode past the whip, the chair and the gun, and empty handed, fearlessly entered the cage.  big leo, snarling, then came charging across the cage towards her with a ferocious road. when the lion was almost upon her, the girl threw open her coat. underneath she was stark naked. leo skidded to a stop and crawled the rest of the way on his belly; he nuzzled the girl's feet with his nose, purred and licked her trim ankles.  the astonished circus manager grinned happily and turned to the pop-eyed young man. "well, young fella," he asked, "think you can top that? "  "yeah ?" panted the applicant, "just get that stupid lion out of there,"	4

so a german, an englishman and an irishman were all in saudi arabia, sharing a smuggled crate of booze when they were arrested by saudi police. the mere possession of alcohol is a severe offence in saudi arabia, so they are all sentenced to death!  however, after many months and with the help of very good lawyers, they were able to appeal their sentences down to 20 lashes each of the whip.  as they were preparing for their punishment, the sheikh announced: "as it is my first wife's birthday today, she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping."  the german was first in line; after thinking for a bit he said, "please tie a pillow to my back." this was done, but after only 10 lashes the whip had shredded the pillow. when the punishment was done the german had to be carried away bleeding and crying in pain.  the englishman was next up. after watching the german in horror he asked, "please tie two pillows to my back." this time it took 15 lashes, but once again the pillows were shredded, and the englishman was led away bleeding and whimpering in pain.  the irishman was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the sheikh turned to him and said: "you are from the most beautiful part of the world i have ever seen. because of this, you may have two wishes!"  "thank you, your most royal and merciful highness," the irishman replied. "in recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes."  "not only are you an honorable man from a beautiful island, you are also very brave," the sheikh said with admiration. "if 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it. and your second wish?"  and the irishman said, "tie the englishman to my back."	5

a man buys a religious horse. one day, a man goes horse buying. he comes across a farmer who happens to be selling a horse 2 miles away from his house.  the man goes to the farmers ranch and inspects the horse. after looking at the horses mouth, legs, tail, and anything else one may imagine, he decides to buy the horse.  the farmer, however, gives the man very specific instructions. which were that the horse was very religious and that to make the horse go/speed up, the man must say “thank god”, and to make the horse stop, the man must say “amen”.  the man, being a little skeptic, gets on the horse and proceeds to say “thank god”, which makes the horse walk. the man says “thank god” again, which makes the horse canter. he continues to do this until the horse is full blown sprinting down the valley.  suddenly, up ahead, the man sees the edge of a cliff approaching very fast. he then says “woah boy”, “stop”, and “stop boy”, none of which causes the horse to slow down.  the man suddenly remembers what the farmer told him and shouts “amen”!!!!!  the horse skids to a dead stop, just inches away from the edge of the cliff.  the man looks down at the bottom of the cliff and leans back in relief...    “thank god”.	4

a joke my religion professor told me... a dutch calvinist gets stranded on a deserted island...  he saved his bible in the shipwreck, so he maintained a prayerful life despite being stranded.  the island was full of fruit and wildlife that he could hunt, so he survived well.  every day he swims out to a channel to see if any ships would pass through.  day after day, for several years, he continued this routine.  one day, when swimming out to the channel, he sees a ship.  he calls out to them, and they rescue him!  he is brought to the captain who marvels at his story of survival.  he asks the captain "can i go back to the island to retrieve my belongings?  some of my things are very important to me."  the captain agrees and sends two crew members with him on a rowboat.  they ask him questions about his survival, eagerly hearing how this man bested the wild for all these years.  approaching his living area, the crew members see three huts.  *one man with three huts*, they wonder, *what could he possibly do with them?*  "what is that leftmost hut used for?" asked a crew member.  "that's my house, where i ate and slept," answered the calvinist.  that made sense.  "what is that middle hut used for?" he followed up.  "that is my church, where i go to pray, read scripture, and worship god, who has kept me alive for all these years," answered the devout calvinist.  that also made sense.  but what could the last hut be for?  "what is the rightmost hut used for?" asked the crew member.  the calvinist answered, "oh, that's where i used to go to church."	1

the old priest was sick off all the people in his parish who kept confessing to adultery. one day he said ‘if i hear one more person confess to adultery, i’ll quit.’  everyone liked the priest, so together they came up with a code word. someone who had committed adultery would say they had ‘fallen.’  this seemed to please the old priest and things went very well, until one day the priest died at an old age. about a week after the new priest arrived, he visited the towns mayor and looked and sounded very concerned.   the priest said ‘you have to do something about all the sidewalks in town. when people come into the confessional, they keep talking about having fallen.’  the mayor started to laugh, realising no-one had told the new priest about the code word.   before the mayor could explain why everyone kept saying they had ‘fallen,’ the priest shook his finger at the mayor and said, ‘i don’t know what you’re laughing about. your wife fell over three times this week!’	4

"oh earl let's do the plane ride today "  earl replies "ethel $5 is $5 , maybe next time."   the pilot interrupts and says "i've seen you two every day for 3 weeks and its always the same so i'll make you a deal, if you and your wife can go the whole ride without making a sound, i'll give you the ride for free."   earl looks at ethel and says "deal"   and off they went.   they're up in the plane and haven't made a sound so the pilot starts pulling out every trick in the book, loops and barrel rolls, nose dives and stalls and still the two dont make a sound.   defeated the pilot lands and everyone gets out.   "man i thought for sure i'd have you holler'n doing all them flips and such"   earl replies "well i was gonna say something when ethel fell out but $5 is $5".	3

this guy was sitting in his cubicle one day . . .  . . . doing paperwork for his company when he heard a voice out of nowhere. "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas." he was a little freaked out by the mysterious voice, but managed to finish out his day, go home, and go to sleep.  the next day he was in the shower when he heard the voice again. "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas." he ignored it and went to work, but while in the elevator going up to his office, he heard it again. "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas."   later that day, while he was in a meeting, he heard it again. "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas." on the car ride home, he heard it again. "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas." in bed trying to sleep, he heard it again. "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas."  the next day was worse. he started hearing the voice every hour on the hour. "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas." he didn't tell anyone, because he didn't want anyone to think he was crazy. he tried to ignore it, but the voice was persistant... "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas." "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas."  the next day, he was hearing the voice over and over and over again. it was louder than ever. "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas." "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas." "quit your job. sell your house. take the money. go to las vegas."  finally, the guy snaps. "all right!"  he immediately quits his job, goes out and sells his house, takes the money, buys a plane ticket, and flies off to las vegas. after he walks out of the airport and into the vegas sun, he hears the voice again. "take your money. go to caesar's palace."  the guy hails a taxi and immediately goes to caesar's palace. as soon as he walks into the front door, he hears the voice again. "go to the roulette tables." the guy runs to the roulette tables. "go to table 45." the guy runs to table 45. the voice says, "take all your money and bet it on red 21." the guy takes all of his money and puts it on red 21.  the dealer spins the wheel and the ball lands on black 18.  "fuck!" yells the voice.	3

a man walks into a bar... he goes up to the bartender and asks him if he likes to gamble.  the bartender says, "sure, i'll take a bet. what's your action?"  the man offers a $50 bet that he can bite his own eyeball. the bartender, thinking it's easy money, accepts his bet, and is shocked when the man removes his glass eye and bites down on it.  laughing, the man sees that the bartender is upset about losing his money, so he offers him a chance to win it back. "double or nothin' says i can bite my other eye."  the bartender thinks it over. he knows he was just tricked out of $50 but he also knows that this man can't possibly have two glass eyes, so he pulls another $50 from the register and accepts the man's bet.  the man promptly takes out his false teeth and gently closes them around his other eye.  now the bartender is visibly angry to have been had for $100, and the man's laughter isn't helping. just before he throws him out of his bar, the man puts his hand up.  "real sorry about that, pal. i get people with that bit all the time, but you've been a good sport, so i'll give you another chance to win some cash. i've got... $500 that says if you slide a shot glass down the bar top, i can run alongside of it and piss into the glass without missing a drop. this is kinda hard for me to do, though, so i think it's fair if you give me two chances at it."  the bartender, eager to win his money back from the man, thinks to himself and realizes just how hard it would be for this man to piss into a shot glass while running at full speed. especially knowing he only has one eye to line up his shot. after a minute of deliberation, he willingly accepts the bet.  the man drops his pants to his ankles and when the bartender puts the shot glass down on the counter, shouts a resounding, "go!" prompting the bartender to slide it along the bar top.  the man chases after it, holding his dick at an angle to properly aim it. however, pissing while running at full speed isn't easy, so he only manages to get a couple of drops in the glass by the time it reaches the other end.  catching his breath, the man reminds the bartender he has a second try, and that the first was simply to get his bearings straight. once again, he shouts, "go!" giving the bartender his cue to send the shot glass back down the bar. once again, the man chases wildly after it, spraying piss all over the bar top, stools, floor, and even hitting some of the bottles of liquor behind the bar. however, not one drop of urine found it's way into the shot glass. head hanging low, he hands the bartender $500, to which the bartender gleefully accepted, jumping up and down in joy and cheering in victory at the cash he had just made.  all of a sudden, a man in the back of the bar slams his fist hard against his table and screams "fuck!" at the top of his lungs.  the bartender mutters aloud, "i wonder what his problem is."  to which the man replies, "oh, i just bet that guy $10,000 that i could piss all over your bar and you'd be so happy about it you jumped up and down with joy."	4
a man walks into a bar,      **he notices a very large jar on the counter,** **and sees that it's filled to the brim with $10.00 bills. he guesses there must be at least ten thousand dollars in it.**  **he approaches the bartender and asks, "what's with the money in the jar?"**   **"well  ...  , you pay $10.00, and if you pass three tests, you get all the money in the jar and the keys to a brand new lexus."**         **the man certainly isn't going to pass this up, so he asks, "what are the three tests?"**         **"you gotta pay first," says the bartender, "those are the rules."**         **so, after thinking it over a while, the man gives the bartender $10.00 which he stuffs into the jar.**         **"okay," says the bartender, "here's what you need to do:**         **first - you have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less, and you can't make a face while doing it."**       **"second - there's a pit bull chained in the back with a bad tooth. you have to remove that tooth with your bare hands."**         **"third - there's a 90-year old lady upstairs who's never had sex. you have to take care of that problem."**       **the man is stunned! "i know i paid my $10.00 but, i'm not an idiot! i won't do it! you'd have to be nuts to drink a quart of tequila and then do all those other things!"**         **"your call," says the bartender, "but, your money stays where it is."**         **as time goes on, the man has a few more drinks and finally says, "where's the damn tequila?!"**         **he grabs the bottle with both hands and drinks it as fast as he can.** **tears stream down both cheeks -- but he doesn't make a face -- and he drinks it in 58 seconds!**   **next, he staggers out the back door where he sees the pit bull chained to a pole. soon, the people inside the bar hear loud growling, screaming, and sounds of a terrible fight -- then nothing but silence!**    **just when they think that the man surely must be dead, he staggers back into the bar. his clothes are ripped to shreds and he's bleeding from bites and gashes all over his body.**   **he drunkenly asks, "now, where's that old woman with the bad tooth?"**	1

a rookie comedian asks an experienced comedian how he manages to cater his jokes toward his audience. the comedian gives the newcomer a slip of paper with a website url. “this is a forum for comedians where they trade jokes. it’s perfect to find the right joke for the right occasion.”  so just before his first gig at a tailors convention, he looks up “jokes for tailors” on the forum. he manages to find a story about a mannequin that leaves the audience in stitches.   the next week, he is set to perform in front of a group of mobsters. again, he looks up some jokes, and finds a post which contains a great mafia joke. it knocks the audience dead.   the week after, he is set to perform to a group of fishermen. so he goes onto the forum and searches for posts that have fishing jokes. but no bites. so he goes to the experienced comedian and asks: “why are there no jokes about fishing in this forum?”  the experienced comedian shrugs and replies: “the reel jokes are in the comments.”	2

a man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. he goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, "my car broke down. do you think i could stay the night?"the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. as the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. a sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. the sirens that nearly seduced odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. he doesn't sleep that night. he tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.the next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, "we can't tell you. you're not a monk." distraught, the man is forced to leave.years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.the monks reply, "we can't tell you. you're not a monk."the man sa,ys, "if the only way i can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."the monks reply, "you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. when you find these answers, you will have become a monk."the man sets about his task. after years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. a monk answers. he is taken before a gathering of all the monks."in my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, i traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: by design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. only god knows what you ask. all a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."the monks reply, "congratulations. you have become a monk. we shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."the monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, "the sound is beyond that door."the monks give him the key, and he opens the door. behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. the man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. and so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. the sound has become very clear and definite. the monks say, "this is the last key to the last door."the man is apprehensive to no end. his life's wish is behind that door!with trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......but, of course, i can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.	4

a lost dog strays into a jungle. a lion sees this from a distance and says with caution "this guy looks edible, never seen his kind before". so the lion starts rushing towards the dog with menace. the dog notices and starts to panic but as he's about to run he sees some bones next to him and gets an idea and says loudly "mmm... that was some good lion meat!".  the lion abruptly stops and says "woah! this guy seems tougher then he looks, i better leave while i can".  over by the tree top, a monkey witnessed everything. evidently, the monkey realizes the he can benefit from this situation by telling the lion and getting something in return. so the monkey proceeds to tell the lion what really happened and the lion says angrily "get on my back, we'll get him together".  so they start rushing back to the dog. the dog sees them and realized what happened and starts to panic even more. he then gets another idea and shouts "where the hell is that monkey! i told him to bring me another lion an hour ago..."	5

blonde helping a trucker a blonde lady motorist was about two hours from san diego when she was flagged down by a man whose truck had broken down……  the man walked up to the car and asked, "are you going to san diego?"    "sure," answered the blonde, "do you need a lift?"   "not for me. i'll be spending the next three hours fixing my truck. my problem is i've got two chimpanzees in the back that have to be taken to the san diego zoo. they're a bit stressed already so i don't want to keep them on the road all day. could you possibly take them to the zoo for me? i'll give you $100 for your trouble."  "i'd be happy to," said the blonde.   so, the two chimpanzees were ushered into the back seat of the blonde's car and carefully strapped into their seat belts, and off they went.   five hours later, the truck driver was driving through the heart of san diego when suddenly he was horrified!  there was the blonde walking down the street, holding hands with the two chimps, much to the amusement of a big crowd.   with a screech of brakes he pulled off the road and ran over to the blonde.   "what are you doing here?" he demanded, "i gave you $100 to take these chimpanzees to the zoo!"   "yes, i know you did," said the blonde. "but we had money left over so now we're going to sea world."	2

a guy walks into a bar with an ostrich  a man walks into a bar with a full-grown ostrich behind him. the waitress asks for their orders. the man says, “a hamburger, fries and a beer,” and turns to the ostrich, “what’s yours?” “i’ll have the same,” says the ostrich.  a short time later the waitress returns with the order. “that will be $18.95 please,” and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment.  the next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, “a hamburger, fries, and a beer.” the ostrich says, “i’ll have the same.”  again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change.   this becomes routine until, the two enter again.  “the usual?” asks the waitress. “no, this is friday night, so i will have a steak, baked potato, and a shot of tequila,” says the man. “same,” says the ostrich. shortly the waitress brings the order and says, “that will be $20.” once again the man pulls the exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table.   the waitress can’t hold back her curiosity any longer. “excuse me, sir. how do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?”  “well,” says the man, “several years ago i was cleaning the attic and found an old lamp. when i rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. my first wish was that if i ever had to pay for anything, i would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there.”  awesome says the waitress. “most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you’ll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!”  “that’s right. whether it’s a gallon of milk or a rolls royce, the exact money is always there,” says the man.  the waitress asks, “but, sir, what’s with the ostrich?” the man sighs, pauses, and answers, “my second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything i say.”	5

a politician dies… and ends up standing in front of the pearly gates. saint peter looks at him for a second, flicks through his book, and finds his name.      “so, you’re a politician…” “well, yes, is that a problem?” “oh no, no problem. but we’ve recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in hell. after that however, you’re free to choose where you want to spend eternity!”      “wait, i have to spend a day in hell??” says the politician. “them’s the rules” says st peter, clicks his fingers, and woomph, the guy dissapears… and awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he’s in hell. cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds… nothing. just the smell of, is that fabric softener? and cut grass, this can’t be right?      “open your eyes!” says a voice. “c'mon, wakey wakey, we’ve only got 24 hours!”. nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he’s in a hotel room. a nice one too. wait, this is a penthouse suite… and there’s a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. “who are you??” the politician asks. “well, i’m satan!” says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. “welcome to hell!” “wait, this is hell? but… where’s all the pain and suffering?” he asks. satan throws him a wink. “oh, we’ve been a bit mis-represented over the years, it’s a long story. anyway, this is your room! the minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there’s extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. but enough of this! it’s a beautiful day, and if you’d care to look outside…” slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. “it’s one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there’s another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!” says satan, answering his unasked question. so they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. and as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he’s admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he’s admired but died long before his career started. and out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. he spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with marylin monroe). as everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear… and they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. after 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep… and is woken up by st peter. “so, that was hell. wasn’t what you were expecting, i bet?” “no sir!” says the man. “so then” says st peter “you can make your choice. it’s hell, which you saw, or heaven, which has choral singing, talking to god, white robes, and so on”. “well… i know this sounds strange, but on balance, i think i’d prefer hell” says the politician. “not a problem, we totally understand! enjoy!” says st peter, and clicks his fingers again.      the man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. as he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. a sudden bolt of lightning reveals satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other. “what’s this??” he cries. “where’s the hotel?? where’s my wife??? where’s the minibar, the golf-courses, the pool, the restaurant, the free drinks and the sunshine???”      “ah”, says satan. “you see, yesterday, we were campaigning. but today, you voted…”	4

joe wanted to buy a motorbike  but he doesn't have much luck until one day, he comes across a honda road bike with a 'for sale' sign on it.  the bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. it is shiny and in absolute mint condition.  he immediately buys it, and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.  'well, it's quite simple, really,' says the seller, 'whenever the bike  is outside and it's gonna rain, rub vaseline on the chrome. it protects  it from the rain.'  and he hands joe a jar of vaseline.  that night, his girlfriend, sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. naturally, they take the bike there.  but just before they enter the house, sandra stops him and says, 'i  have to tell you something about my family before we go in.'  'when we eat dinner, we don't talk. in fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.'  'no problem,' he says. and in they go.  joe is shocked. right in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.  in the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.  they sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.  as dinner progresses, joe decides to take advantage of the situation.  so he leans over and kisses sandra.  no one says a word.  so he reaches over and fondles her breasts.  still, nobody says a word. so he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes  off, throws her on the table, and shags her right there, in front of  her parents.  his girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is  obviously livid, and her mother horrified when he sits back down, but no  one says a word.  he looks at her mother..  'she's got a great body,' he thinks.  so he grabs the mother, bends her over the dinner table, pulls down her  knickers, and screws her every way possible right there on the dinner table.  after she has a big orgasm, he sits down again.  now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, the mother is pleasantly beaming.  but still, total silence.  all of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.  joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of vaseline from his pocket...  suddenly the father shouted....  'ok i'll do the fucking dishes!	5

the island joke. there was an island with three kingdoms on it. let's call them a, b and c. the island had a fresh water lake on it and the lake itself had an island. the three kingdoms always kept fighting over this island.  one day the three kingdoms decided to settle this dispute once it for all and sent small portions of their armies. kingdom a sent 15 knights and 25 squires; kingdom b send 20 knights and 25 squires and kingdom c sent one knight and one squire.  the knights decided among themselves that this fighting was beneath them and decided to let the squires settle things by themselves. while the squires of kingdom a and kingdom b were warming up, the squire of kingdom c erected a tall pole, tied a noose to it and hung a pot in the noose.  when they actually started fighting, the squire of kingdom c was able to successfully fight off all the other squires, because the squire of the high-pot-and-noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.	5

"sisters, welcome to heaven. before you enter, you must be cleansed of sin in this holy water." he says, pointing at the chalice beside him.  he calls up the first nun and says "have you ever touched a mans penis?"  "yes" responds the nun. "with the tip of my finger".  saint peter nods solemnly and has the nun dip her finger into the holy water. she then proceeds into heaven.  he calls up the second nun and poses the same question. she responds "yes, with my entire hand".   saint peter has her plunge her entire hand into the holy water. she is purified, and enters heaven.  he is about to call up the third nun, when the fourth in line runs forward and interrupts him.  "let me go next. i'm not gargling that shit after she dips her ass in it!".	3

"well, watch this, then, he can speak french too. parlez-vous francais?"  the parrot remains silent. the man is sweating through his jacket, and the bartender is chuckling derisively. "hand over the cash, sir, and have a nice night."  as he walks dejectedly out of the bar, the man turns to the parrot. "you jerk!", he cries. "you cost me ten bucks!"  the parrot, taken aback, ruffles his feathers arrogantly. "cost you? buddy, i just made you a fortune! think of the odds you can get there tomorrow!"	5

a woman joins a country club and when she hears the guys talking about their golf round, she says, "i played on my college's golf team. i was pretty good. mind if i join you next week?" no one wants to say 'yes', but they're on the spot… finally, one man says, "okay, but we start at 6:30 a.m."  he figures the early tee-time will discourage her.  the woman says this may be a problem and asks if she can be up to 15 minutes late.  they roll their eyes, but say, "okay."  she's there at 6:30 am. sharp and beats all of them with an eye-opening 2-under par round.  she's fun and pleasant and the guys are impressed.  they congratulate her and invite her back the next week.  she smiles, and says, "i'll be there at 6:30, or 6:45."  the next week she again shows up at 6:30 sharp.  only this time, she plays left-handed.  the three guys are incredulous as she still beats them with an even par round, despite playing with her off-hand.  they're totally amazed.  they can't figure her out.  she's very pleasant and a gracious winner.  they invite her back again, but each man harbors a burning desire to beat her.  the third week, she's 15 minutes late, which irritates the guys.  this week she plays right-handed and narrowly beats all three of them.  the men grumble that her late arrival is petty gamesmanship on her part.  however, she's so charming and complimentary of their strong play, they can't hold a grudge.  this woman is a riddle no one can figure out.  they have a couple of beers in the clubhouse and finally, one of the men asks her, "how do you decide if you're going to golf right-handed or left-handed?"  the lady blushes, and grins. "when my dad taught me to play golf, i learned that i was ambidextrous." she replies. "i like to switch back and forth."  "when i got married after college, i discovered my husband always sleeps in the nude. from then on, i developed a silly habit. right before i leave in the morning for golf practice, i pull the covers off him. if his willie points to the right, i golf right-handed; if it points to the left, i golf left-handed."  the guys think this is hysterical.  astonished at this bizarre information, one of the guys says, "what if it's pointing straight up?"  she says, "then, i'm fifteen minutes late."	4

"my parents don't like me dressing up like a girl."  it's still unclear whether she jumped or was pushed.	2

an atheist decides he was to be jewish... an atheist is inspired by the jewish philosophy and approach to religion, how it's built around questioning and responding with more and deeper questions. he's not sold on the god stuff, but decides he can look past that if it means getting to engage with a thoughtful, inquisitive community.  so, he goes to see the local rabbi and ask about joining. the rabbi explains it's not so easy. there's a process, and it's a long one, and maybe easier to go back in time and be born to a jewish mother, if truth be told.  but, the atheist says those rules are outdated, and a religious community should be based only on shared beliefs.  the rabbi responds that part of those shared beliefs is a shared respect for the tradition.  but the atheist points out that the tradition is one of questioning the rules.  they go back and forth, on and on, neither giving an inch in the argument until finally the atheist is just exhausted and gives up saying, "fine, i guess if you won't let me join there's nothing i can do about that."  "not let you join?" the rabbi says, "what do you think we've been doing this whole time?"	4

"not really." the guy says. "the hamster's a ventriloquist."	5

"i've never seen anything like this" he said. "you can't have sex, you couldn't give birth, and it doesn't look like you can even use it for the toilet. can i get a colleague in to have a look?"  the woman agreed, and the doctor brought in a senior gynaecologist. he examined her too, and was equally stumped.  "you can't do anything with your vagina!" he exclaimed. "can i call in a colleague?"  the woman agreed, and a specialist surgeon visited. he was also baffled.  "well, your vagina seems completely non-operational" he said. "but we can actually remove it and fit you with a prosthetic, which will be indistinguishable from a real one"  the woman agreed, and the operation went ahead that night. her non-functioning vagina was taken out, and a prosethic one fitted.   the woman recovered well, and went on to love a long and happy life.   as for the vagina, it went on to get matched with me in every overwatch quick play with all the other useless cunts! fucking heal for christ's sake!	2

timmy loved tractors. his life was all about tractors. timmy loved tractors. his life was all about tractors. tractor bedspread, tractor themed birthday parties, tractor t-shirts, school bags, lunchbox, everything timmy owned was tractor themed in some way. he knew everything there was to know about tractors; big, small, new, old, he knew it all. when he grew up, he was going to drive a tractor. he was saving as hard as a 12 year old could, so that one glorious day, he could buy and own his own tractor. timmy seriously loved tractors.  as timmy aged, his obsession grew deeper. he yearned for the day he could own and drive his own tractor, until one day he overheard his parents talking about how they were going to surprise him with a brand new john deere for his 18th birthday. he could barely contain himself.  finally, the big day arrived. he was 18! he woke with a start, peeked out the window, and there in the driveway was a giant, brand new john deere tractor. happy birthday timmy! was scrawled on the front windscreen of the tractor. he ran outside, and there were his parents, smiling as widely as any parent could. he ran and hugged his parents, crying and laughing with pure glee in the shadow of the colossus. he had never felt this way before!  but enough was enough. it was time.  he climbed into the cab and sat in the driver's seat. it was perfect. he had waited 18 years for this moment. his hand was shaking as he reached for the key in the ignition. he quickly turned it and…  rrrrrrrrrr clunk!  it didn't start. that's odd. try again.  rrrrrrrrrr clunk!  again? this is weird. bit of a shame, battery must be a bit flat? try again.  rrrrrrrrrr clunk!  timmy froze. the tractor wouldn't start. he was let down, betrayed. his whole life up to this point had been a lie. there was a paradigm shift in every fiber of timmy's being.  something inside timmy snapped.  timmy screamed, and leaped out of the tractor. he ran to the garage still screaming, and returned with an axe and a fuel can. screaming like a possessed viking, he hacked and slashed the tractor. the windows, wheels, cab, dash - nothing was left unscathed. then he doused it in gasoline and lit it up. he stood, panting, watching the tractor burn, with the wails of his parents in the background.  timmy walked away, to a bar. he was 18 now, and he needed a drink. he sat down and ordered a beer. timmy sat at the bar reflecting on his life and his disappointment in all things tractor related. he was trying to forget it all when a putrid stench reached his nose. thick, black, putrid smoke was billowing into the bar, obviously from his burning tractor down the road. everybody in the bar was coughing and trying to get away to clear air. this smoke was from a tractor and it made timmy mad, so he jumped up onto the bar and with one deep breath he sucked up all the smoke in the building, and blew it outside.  everybody stared at him in stunned silence. no one moved. the bartender spoke for everyone in the room  "how on earth did you do that?"  timmy slowly turned to him. "i'm an ex tractor fan"	2

"it's perfect," the old snail exclaims, "i'll take it. but first, i'd like you to paint a big letter s on the hood, and one on the trunk and each of the doors."  the salesman, happy to earn commission on the most expensive car on the lot but puzzled by the request says to the old snail, "of course we can do that for you, but are you sure you want to paint letters on a car? what if it lowers the value?"  so the old snail replies, "listen, my whole life i've been slow and boring, nobody has ever noticed me. but when people see me drive by in this beauty, they're all gonna say:  "wow, look at that s car go."	2

a man was talking to his therapist about finding the right woman. a man was sitting in his therapist’s office telling him about how he finally managed to find the right woman, after a whopping 3 divorces. he says, “well the first wife was quite the fireball and we had good chemistry, but she was a fitness instructor and during sex always yelled ‘harder! stronger! keep up that heart rate!’ and at some point i just couldn’t keep up... so we split.”  “well,” said the therapist, “what about the second wife?”  the man replied, “the second wife was a great woman and i really have great respect for her, but she was a teacher and during sex would always scold me to ‘do it again! do it better!’ and at some point my i’ve wore thin and i had to leave.”  “when you don’t feel a connection anymore, leaving is the only option” said the therapist. “and the third?”  “the third was a wonderful young spirit, the only thing was that she was a formula 1 driver and would constantly yell ‘faster! faster! pick up the pace!’ when we made love - it became unbearable so yet again we had to part ways.  “with this sort of luck i don’t blame you for being down on yourself... and what about now? you are married again?” asked the therapist.  “oh yes, now i have the perfect woman!!” said the man.  “she’s a construction worker, so every time we have sex there is no stress... if i ever get tired she says, ‘ah, fuck it, this can wait ‘til tomorrow.’”	4

speeding a state trooper running a speed trap flags a sedan for traveling 75mph in a 50mph zone.  the trooper immediately flips on his lights and stops the car.  "do you know why i pulled you over?", the trooper asks the driver as a matter of routine.  "it might be the six kilos of cocaine in the back seat.", says the driver.  the officer is taken aback and doesn't quite know how to respond.  "no sir, you were driv-"  "well, is it the loaded 9mm in the glove box?" the driver continues.  the trooper places his hand on his gun and radios for back up before saying, "sir, i need you to-"  "look, if it's the dead body in the trunk, just come out and say it." the driver shockingly admits.  the trooper draws his gun, orders the driver out of the car, handcuffs him, and places him in the back of his squad car just as back up arrives.  the trooper tells his back up of the situation and they begin a search of the vehicle.  no drugs are found in the back seat.  the glove box contains only an insurance card.  the trunk is found only to have a spare tire and a roadside emergency kit.  perplexed, the trooper and his colleagues suddenly hear from the squad car...  *i'll bet that lying bastard told you i was speeding too!*	2

the madam of a whore house answered the ring of the bell and, on opening the door, she found standing there on the threshold, an ancient, bearded gentleman in rabbi's garb.  "may i come in?" asked the rabbi gently in an aged, quavering voice. feeling a little confused, the madam said, "but rabbi, surely you must be in the wrong place. here is where we..."  "i know what you do here," interrupted the rabbi. "you don't think i came here for chopped liver, do you? bring on the girls."  still confused, but understanding her professional duties, the madam had several girls line up. the rabbi tottered from one to another until he reached rose, a large redhead with enormous breasts. he looked at her with appreciation and pointed, "good! i'll take those."  the rabbi paid out the necessary sum and rosie led him upstairs. she helped him off with his coat and hung it up carefully on the nail on the door. then she helped him off with the rest of his clothes and got into bed. there, to rosie's astonishment, the rabbi performed with an address and a skill that was unbelievable. in fact, rosie, a hardened professional, found herself surprised into orgasm.  as they lay in bed a few minutes afterwards, relaxing, rosie said, "how old are you, rabbi?" the rabbi said, "god has been good to me. i am eighty-eight years old." "that is certainly amazing. listen, rabbi, if you're ever in the neighborhood again and if you should feel in the mood, please ask for me - rosie. i would be delighted to oblige you."  the rabbi said, with a certain hauteur, "what do you mean, if i should be in the mood again? let me sleep for five minutes right now and, believe me, i will be in the mood again." "really, rabbi? then please take a nap."  "okay." the rabbi adjusted himself into a relaxed position, face up, placed his arms across his chest and then said, "wait one minute. this is important. while i'm asleep, scoop up my testicles with your right hand and hold them an inch above the sheet, without moving them. keep them absolutely motionless." "of course, rabbi," said rosie, and did as she was told, holding the rabbi's testicles free of the sheet. for five minutes the rabbi slept, then woke with a start and said, "i'm ready." and so he was, for, to rosie's delight, he was even better the second time than the first. as she lay panting, rosie said, "it was wonderful, rabbi, but one thing i don't understand. why was it necessary to hold your testicles motionless above the sheet while you were sleeping?"  "oh that," said the rabbi. "well, you are a nice girl and i like you very much. still, the truth is i don't know you very well, and over there, in my coat, hanging on the hook on the door, is fifteen hundred dollars.”	5

my grandfather died and i inherited some of his clothes.  he was a poultry farmer and he loved getting dressed up every year for the local fair and exhibiting his prize chickens. my grandmother would spend the entire year searching through thrift shops looking for silly neckties for him to wear, and she loved finding ones with chickens on them.  after a few decades of this, my grandfather had amassed several dozen neckties, each one with cartoonish images of chickens flying around, laying eggs, and doing other chicken activities. i always complimented him on the newest addition to his collection.  when he died a couple of years ago, he bequeathed them to me in his will. when my grandmother handed me the bag full of them, my eyes welled with tears and i smiled thinking about my grandfather looking in the mirror and straightening his tie.  why am i telling you all of this backstory? because the last time i tried to tell this to someone and i didn't give context, they thought it was weird that i was so excited about inheriting my dead grandfather's hen tie collection.	3

'we must know that you will follow your instructions no matter what the circumstances.' inside the room you will find your wife sitting in a chair... we need you to kill her' the man said, 'you can't be serious. i could never shoot my wife.' the agent said, 'then you're not the right man for this job. take your wife and go home.'   the second man was given the same instructions. he took the gun and went into the room. all was quiet for about 5 minutes. the man came out with tears in his eyes, 'i tried, but i can't kill my wife.' the agent said, 'you don't have what it takes. take your wife home.'   finally, the last man was given the same instructions, to kill his wife. he took the gun and went into the room. shots were heard, one after another. they heard screaming, crashing, banging on the walls. after a few minutes, all was quiet. the door opened slowly and there stood the man, wiping the sweat from his brow. 'some idiot loaded the gun with blanks' he said. 'i had to strangle that bitch to death'.	1

a man dies and goes to hell.  once there, he finds that there is a different hell for each country, so he tries to seek out the least painful one.     at the door to german hell, he is told: "first they put you in an electric chair for an hour. then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. then the german devil comes in and whips you for the rest of the day."     he does not like the sound of that, so he checks out american hell, russian hell and many more. they are all similarly gruesome. however, at nigerian hell a long line of people is waiting to get in. amazed, he asks, "what do they do here?"     he is told: "first they put you in an electric chair for an hour. then they lay you on a bed of nails for another hour. then the nigerian devil comes in and whips you for the rest of the day."     "but that's the same as the others," says the man. "why are so many people waiting to get in?"     "because of the power cuts, the electric chair does not work. the nails were paid for but never supplied, so the bed is comfortable. and the nigerian devil used to be a civil servant, so he comes in, signs his time sheet and goes back home for private business.	5

a man walks into a bar... he leans over and says to the bartender, "hey, will you give me a free beer if i show you something so amazing that i can guarantee you've never seen it before?"  the bartender says, "okay, but it had better be good."  the man reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a hamster. he sets the hamster down on the bar. it scurries about, jumps off the end, turns a perfect somersault in midair, and lands on the piano. he then begins to dance across the keys, playing the piano beautifully.   the bartender says, "wow! that was truly incredible! have a beer."  the man finishes his beer and says to the bartender, "hey, if i show you something else that is so amazing i can guarantee you've never seen before, will you give me another free beer?"  "if it's as amazing as that hamster, then sure," the bartender replies.  so the man reaches into his other coat pocket and pulls out a frog. he sets the frog down on the bar, and the frog begins to sing beautifully. the bartender is again amazed, and the man earns another beer.  as the man is drinking his beer, a guy at the other end of the bar walks over and says, "what a performer! i'll give you $500 for that frog."  the first man says, "it’s a deal!" and sells the guy his frog. the bartender shakes his head slowly. "not that it's any of my business, mind you, but that was a real, live singing frog. why would you sell it for only $500? you could have made millions off of it."  the man says, "nah, don't worry. the hamster's also a ventriloquist."    edit: spaced it out to make it easier to read	5

there were once three brothers... they loved to go hunting together. all season long they would get up at the crack of dawn to hunt deer in the woods. however, the youngest brother had chronic bowel issues. he would try to get his “business” done before they started their hunting, but sometimes he would have to take some time in the woods to relieve himself. it often took quiet a while, since it was violent and messy, but the older two brothers didn’t mind.  one day, as the brothers were hunting, the youngest had to excuse himself to explode. the other brothers decided to continue hunting without him and shot a nice sized buck. since their brother was taking so long, they thought of a hilarious prank they could play on him. they gutted the buck, took out the intestines, snuck up behind their brother, and placed the intestines underneath him. the youngest brother didn’t notice and the other brothers thought they got away with it! they went back to the buck and laughed their heads off, thinking they were so funny and clever.  they waited and waited for their brother to finish up and come find them, but they waited for a long time. finally, the youngest brother caught up with them and had a big grin on his face. “guys! you’ll never believe this! i pooped my guts out! but, with two hours and a sharp stick, i got them all back in.”	1

there was an old man who lived by a forest. as he grew older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald. that day, he called his children to a meeting he said, "look at my hair. it used to be so magnificent, but it's completely gone now. my hair can't be saved. but look outside at the forest. it's such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they'll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair."  "what i want you to do..." the man continued. "is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. tell your descendants to do the same. it shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong."  so they did.  each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.  and for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.	5

a multi-millionaire living in darwin, australia, decided to throw a party and invited all of his buddies and neighbors... he also invited brian, the only aborigine in the neighborhood.  he held the party around the pool in the backyard of his mansion. everyone was having a good time drinking, dancing, eating prawns and oysters from the barbecue, and flirting.  then at the height of the party, the millionaire said, "i have a 15 foot man-eating crocodile in my pool and i'll give a million dollars to anyone who'll join him in the pool."  the words were barely out of his mouth when there was a loud splash.  everyone turned around and saw brian in the pool fighting madly with the crocodile, jabbing it in the eyes with his thumbs, throwing punches, head butting it, getting it in choke holds, biting it's tail and flipping it through the air like some kind of martial arts expert.  the water was churning and splashing everywhere. both brian and the crocodile were screaming and raising hell.  finally, after what seemed like an age, brian strangled the crocodile and let it float to the top of the pool like a dead goldfish.  an exhausted brian wearily climbed out of the pool with everybody staring at him in disbelief.  the millionaire said, "well, brian, i reckon i owe you a million dollars then."  "nah, you all right boss, i don't want it," said brian.  so the millionaire said "man, i have to give you something. you won the bet. how about half a million bucks?"  "no thanks, i don't want it," brian insisted.  the millionaire said, "come on, i insist on giving you something. that was amazing. how about a new porsche, a rolex and some stock options?"  once again, brian said, "no."  confused, the rich man asked, "well brian, then what do you want?"  "i want the bastard who pushed me in," said brian.	5

a great scientist invents a machine to split the pain of birth between a couple... he finds a couple who just went into labour, and asks them if he can use the machine on them, as a test.  the couple agrees, and the husband says "we can split it 50 - 50, its only fair". so the scientist turns the machine up to 50%, just as the baby begins coming out, and the women starts groaning in pain...  "i feel nothing" says the husband. "crank it up to 75%" the scientist is hesitant, but turns the machine up to 75%.   "i still feel nothing" the husband says, "crank it up to 100%" the scientist slowly turns the machine to 100%, and the wife begins to feel nothing.   "huh" says the husband. "turn it up to 200%, i'm curious"  the scientist, seeing that the man is completely fine turns the machine up to 200% and the man still feels nothing.  the baby is born and after some time spent in the hospital, the couple go home. as they pull up to their driveway they find the mailman dead on the front porch.

"i didn't ask for any details", the lawyer interrupted. "just answer the question, ...please. did you, or did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'i'm fine!'?"  clyde said, "well, i had just got bessie into the trailer behind the tractor and i was driving down the road...."  the lawyer interrupted again and said, "your honor, i am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the highway patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. i believe he is a fraud. please tell him to simply answer the question."  by this time, the judge was fairly interested in clyde's answer and said to the lawyer, "i'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite cow, bessie".  clyde thanked the judge and proceeded. "well, as i was saying, i had just loaded bessie, my favorite cow, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my john deer tractor right in the side. i was thrown into one ditch and bessie was thrown into the other. i was hurting, real bad and didn't want to move. however, i could hear old bessie moaning and groaning. i knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.  shortly after the accident a highway patrolman came on the scene. he could hear bessie moaning and groaning, so he went over to her. after he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. then the patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, "how are you feeling?"  "now tell me, what the heck would you say?"	4

in 1986, peter davies was on holiday in kenya after graduating from louisiana state university . on a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. the elephant seemed distressed, so peter approached it very carefully. he got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. as carefully and as gently as he could, peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot. the elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.  twenty years later, peter was walking through the chicago zoo with his teenaged son. as they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where peter and his son cameron were standing. the large bull elephant stared at peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. the elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.  remembering the encounter in 1986, peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. he walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. the elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.  probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.  this is for everyone who sends me those heart-warming bullshit stories.	3

a cop lies in wait as a group leaves a bar finally closing time, he dims his lights and waits for the group to get in their vehicles.  as the people get to their cars, the first car to leave the parking lot swerves a bit, pops the curb slightly, continues on and gets back on the road and makes a slow start to head home. seeing this, the cop turns on his lights and is in pursuit. as he pulls up behind him, the man pulls over and begins to go for his liscence and registration.  as the officer walks up and takes the man's info, he asks, "been drinking a bit tonight have we?"  "no sir."   "okay don't lie to me son, i saw how you exited the parking lot, you were all over the road!"  "to be fair, sir, it's narrow and it caught me off guard, besides, i can't drink tonight."  "still gotta breathalyze you, and do the routine stuff, so stop out of the car."  the man blows 0.0 and passes all the officers tests.  "i don't understand,"the officer exclaims, " this doesn't make any sense."   "i told you, i can't drink, i'm the dd tonight."  "sir, it's just you in the car, you must be delusional in that case."  "no, i'm just the designated decoy."	3

" my name is darryl, and this is my brother billy ray. we would like to join up sir."   " excellent, tell me men what do you do for a living now?" the recruiter asks.   billy ray says, " i'm a pilot."   the recruiter breaks into a huge smile. " wonderful, we always need pilots in the air force. come this way and we will get you all set up."   the recruiter leads billy ray out of the room to do his enlistment paperwork. after about ten minutes, the recruiter returns to talk to darryl.   the recruiter looks at darryl and says, " so what do you do for a living?"   " i'm a wood chopper." darryl replies.   the recruiter frowns, " oh. well i am sorry sir. i am afraid i can't help you."   darryl gets a confused look on his face and asks the recruiter, " what do you mean, you just took my brother?"   " that's because your brother is a pilot. we need pilots in the air force. we just simply have no need for wood choppers in the air force."   darryl again looks at the recruiter confused and says, " yeah, but i got to chop the wood before billy ray can pile it!"	4

the life of a widow a successful rancher died and left everything to his devoted wife.   she was a very good-looking woman and determined to keep the ranch, but knew very little about ranching, so she decided to place an ad in the newspaper for a ranch hand..  two cowboys applied for the job. one was gay and the other a drunk.  she thought long and hard about it, and when no one else applied she decided to hire the gay guy, figuring it would be safer to have him around the house than the drunk.   he proved to be a hard worker who put in long hours every day and knew a lot about ranching.  for weeks, the two of them worked, and the ranch was doing very well  then one day, the rancher's widow said to the hired hand, "you have done a really good job, and the ranch looks great. you should go into town and kick up your heels." the hired hand readily agreed and went into town one saturday night.  one o'clock came, however, and he didn't return.  two o'clock and no hired hand.  finally he returned around two-thirty, and upon entering the room, he found the rancher's widow sitting by the fireplace with a glass of wine, waiting for him.  she quietly called him over to her..  "unbutton my blouse and take it off," she said.  trembling, he did as she directed. "now take off my boots."  he did as she asked, ever so slowly. "now take off my socks."  he removed each gently and placed them neatly by her boots.  "now take off my skirt."  he slowly unbuttoned it, constantly watching her eyes in the fire light.  "now take off my bra.." again, with trembling hands, he did as he was told and dropped it to the floor.      then she looked at him and said, "if you ever wear my clothes into town again, you're fired."	5

"i'll have the same," says the ostrich. a short time later the waitress returns with the order. "that will be $6.40 please," and the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out the exact change for payment. the next day, the man and the ostrich come again and the man says, "i'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke," and the ostrich says, "i'll have the same." once again the man reaches into his pocket and pays with exact change. this becomes a routine until late one evening, the two enter again. "the usual?" asks the waitress. "no, this is friday night, so i will have a steak, baked potato and salad," says the man, "same for me," says the ostrich. a short time later the waitress comes with the order and says, "that will be $12.62."once again the man pulls exact change out of his pocket and places it on the table. the waitress can't hold back her curiosity any longer. "excuse me, sir.how do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?" "well," says the man, "several years ago i was cleaning the attic and i found an old lamp. when i rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. my first wish was that if i ever had to pay for anything, i would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there." "that's brilliant!"says the waitress. "most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!" "that's right. whether it's a gallon of milk or a rolls royce, the exact money is always there," says the man. the waitress asks, "one other thing, sir, what's with the ostrich?" the man sighs, pauses, and answers, "my second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything i say."	4

ever heard a joke with a moral? a mosquito is flying above the surface of a lake. beneath it, in the water, there is a salmon swimming. it sees the mosquito and thinks to itself: "if only it would fly a little lower, i could jump out of the water and catch it." on the shore, there is a bear standing quietly and thinks to itself: "if only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out, catch the mosquito and then i can rush in and eat the fish." behind the bear in the bushes is a hunter and he thinks to himself: "if only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the fish would jump out, bear would run at the fish and i could shoot the animal, make a nice rug." behind the huntsman, there is a little mouse and it thinks to itself: "if only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out of the water, the bear would run at the fish, huntsman would shoot and wouldn't notice that his sandwich falls out of his pocket." behind the mouse, in the tall grass, there is a cat lurking and it's thinking to itself: "if only that mosquito would fly a little lower, the salmon would jump out of the water, bear would run at the fish, huntsman would shoot and his sandwich falls out of his pocket, mouse would start eating it and won't be paying attention to it's surroundings and i can attack it."    and so it happens. mosquito flies lower, salmon jumps out of the water, bear runs at the fish, huntsman shoots, sandwich falls out of his pocket, mouse is already gnawing at it and then the cat jumps at the mouse, but completely miscalculates and lands in the water. now, what is the moral of this story? in order to get the pussy wet, you need a long foreplay.	3

"sure thing" says the husband.   "dont you think you should follow the doctors advice and write it down?" asks the wife.  "nah i'll remember it honey" he says.  "but i'd like strawberries with it too"   "okay" he says "but i dont need to write it down, i'll remember it"  the wife says "but i'd also like whipped cream with it too".  "yep, not a problem" he says.  "are you sure you don't want to write this down?" she asks, concerned.  "i'll remember it all, don't you worry" he replies and goes into the kitchen.   he's in the kitchen for a good 20 minutes and just as the wife starts to wonder what hes doing, he comes through the door with a plate of sausages, bacon and eggs.  she looks at the plate with a mixture of confusion and annoyance. she then looks at him, frowns and says "where's my toast?"	4

a woman takes a lover home during the day while her husband is at work. her 9-year old son comes home unexpectedly, sees them and hides in the bedroom closet to watch.  the woman's husband also comes home. she puts her lover in the closet, not realizing that the little boy is in there already. the little boy says, "dark in here."  the man says, "yes, it is." boy - "i have a baseball." man - "that's nice." boy - "want to buy it?" man - "no, thanks." boy - "my dad's outside." man - "ok, how much?" boy - "$150" man - "sold."  in the next few weeks, it happens again that the boy and the lover are in the closet together.  boy - "dark in here." man - "yes, it is." boy - "i have a wilson infielder's glove." the lover, remembering the last time, asks the boy,"how much?" boy - "$350" man - "highway robbery. sold."  a few days later, the father says to the boy, "grab your gloves, let's go outside and have a game of catch."  the boy says, "i can't, i sold my ball and my glove." the father asks, "how much did you sell them for?" the boy says, "$500" the father says, "that's terrible to overcharge your friends like that... that is way more than those two things cost. i'm going to take you to church and make you confess your greed."  they go to the church and the father makes the little boy sit in the confession booth with the priest  to confess his sins and he closes the door.  the boy says, "dark in here." the priest says, "don't start that crap again, you're in my closet now."	4

encouraging a sick relative the pandemic swept over the land and finally affected this one small town and one family in particular. little billy's beloved grandfather fell sick and had to be taken to the hospital.  the family checked in with him virtually several times a week, and billy's mother coached him on what to say during these video visits: "how are you?  get well soon!  we love you!"  finally a day came when the family learned that grandfather had taken a turn for the worse and would have to go on a ventilator.  he would of course be unable to talk after that.  billy's mother gave him instructions.  "now billy, grandfather is very sick now.  the doctors will have to work very hard to help him.  we have to give grandfather encouragement. so when you speak to him today, say "i hope they pull you through."  so they logged in for the visit. grandfather came on the screen, and billy's mother nudged him to speak.  "hello, how are you?"  the grandfather, pale and thin, answered in a thin raspy voice.  "i'm at death's door."  billy answered, "i hope they pull you through!"	1
this is a joke from a dream last night, apperantly my brain conjured it up on the spot... let's see how well it works john, a young farmer, was engaged and would soon be wed to a young woman from a nearby town. one day, his soon-to-be father-in-law stopped by for a chat.  “john,” he said, “i have a secret. i am actually a powerful genie! and since you seem like a nice young man, i will grant you three wishes to ensure that you and my daughter have a good life together.”  “wow!” john replied. “but i’m not so sure… could you, say, make a chocolate covered blt sandwich appear out of thin air? just to prove that you are what you say.”  “why of course,” replied the genie, and poof! a chocolate-covered sandwich appeared out of thin air in john’s hands.  “amazing!” said john. “yes!” replied the genie, “you now have two wishes remaining.”  “oh dear, i had better make my remaining wishes count,” john said, thinking for a moment. “okay, to make sure that your daughter and i have the best life together, my choices are clear. first, i wish that my fields are always fertile and my crops are always plentiful, so that money will never be an issue for us.”  “done.” replied the genie.  “and now finally,” john said, “i wish that your daughter was actually attractive.”     	3

christian vs jewish several centuries ago, the pope decreed that all the jews had to leave italy. there was, of course, a huge outcry from the jewish community, so the pope offered a deal. he would have a religious debate with a leader of the jewish community. if the jewish leader won the debate, the jews would be permitted to stay in italy. if the pope won, the jews would have to leave.  the jewish community met and picked an aged rabbi, moishe, to represent them in the debate. rabbi moishe, however, could not speak latin and the pope could not speak yiddish. so it was decided that this would be a "silent" debate.  on the day of the great debate, the pope and rabbi moishe sat opposite each other for a full minute before the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers. rabbi moishe looked back and raised one finger. next, the pope waved his finger around his head. rabbi moishe pointed to the ground where he sat. the pope then brought out a communion wafer and chalice of wine. rabbi moishe pulled out an apple. with that, the pope stood up and said, "i concede the debate. this man has bested me. the jews can stay."  later, the cardinals gathered around the pope, asking him what had happened. the pope said, "first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up one finger to remind me that there was still one god common to both our religions. then i waved my finger around me to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us. i pulled out the wine and the wafer to show that god absolves us of our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of original sin. he had an answer for everything. what could i do?"  meanwhile, the jewish community crowded around rabbi moishe, asking what happened. "well," said moishe, "first he said to me, 'you jews have three days to get out of here.' so i said to him, 'up yours'. then he tells me the whole city would be cleared of jews. so i said to him, 'listen here mr. pope, the jews ... we stay right here!"  "and then?" asked a woman.  "who knows?" said rabbi moishe. "we broke for lunch."	3

a long time ago, on the island of tridia, a group of peculiar people dwelled in peace. they were a small, peace-loving group of individuals. they were peculiar for several reasons: they were all extremely short, the tallest of them coming to a whopping meter in height; they were zealously religious, but they had no particular religion; and they lived primarily in isolation, due to the volatile nature of the sea surrounding their island.   these trids, for such they called themselves, lived in peace and harmony for a long time, until a giant washed up on their shore. he was a practical giant, and not at all religious, and went to dwell at the top of the only hill on their island. he could not abide their high voices nor their zealous religiosity. their population grew and grew over the years, until they began encroaching on his land at the top of the hill. so, he started to grab 12 trids per year and kicked them off the cliff at the top of his hill to help maintain the population. additionally, any trid that roamed near his dwelling at the top was similarly kicked. surprisingly, the trids resented this, but due to their peaceful nature and lack of insight and weapons, had no capacity to resist his efforts.   over the years they grew accustomed to his presence and accepted their lot in life, because they had no where to go and no option but to submit to this treatment.   years and years passed, and one day, a traveling rabbi arrived on the island and began teaching the trids his faith. they immediately accepted it with zeal and enthusiasm and the rabbi found himself surprised but pleased by his success.   they mentioned to him that there was a giant who might benefit from the laws of judaism and moses, primarily that law that condemned murder. the rabbi, with no small amount of trepidation, began a long and slow ascent up the giant's mountain, for he had mercy upon the trids and wanted to help them.   he got to the lower foothills, and didn't see the giant or any sign of him.   he climbed the winding trail up to the middle of the large hill, and still saw no sign of the giant.   he finally reached the summit and after looking around, thought perhaps the giant was a myth, but when he turned to leave, a 2.5 meter walking pectoral of a man stood before the rabbi. he was nothing but muscle and very, very happy to see someone who wasn't a trid.   "good sir, i can see by your garb you are a rabbi. please, come to my cave, where i have prepared a soup with food from my garden," this giant said.   "you won't kick me off?" the rabbi responded. the giant laughed, shook his head, and beckoned the rabbi to follow.   the rabbi, surprised but pleased by this treatment, wordlessly followed the giant to a lovely cave, decorated with pretty rocks and interestingly gnarled plants.   they enjoyed a silent meal, and the rabbi found himself wondering more and more why the trids feared this gentle giant.   "my giant friend, i was sent here by the trids to attempt to persuade you to stop kicking them off the mountain, but you seem so kind, i'm not sure you could do such a thing. after all, you didn't kick me off."   "no, silly rabbi, kicks are for trids!"	3

three contractors are bidding to fix a broken fence at the white house. all three go with a white house official to examine the fence. the minnesota contractor takes out a tape measure and does some measuring, then works some figures with a pencil. "well," he says, "i figure the job will run about $900: $400 for materials, $400 for my crew and $100 profit for me."  the tennessee contractor also does some measuring and figuring, then says, "i can do this job for $700: $300 for materials, $300 for my crew and $100 profit for me."  the chicago contractor doesn't measure or figure, but leans over to the white house official and whispers, "$2,700."  the official, incredulous, says, "you didn't even measure like the other guys! how did you come up with such a high figure?" the chicago contractor whispers back, "$1000 for me, $1000 for you, and we hire the guy from tennessee to fix the fence."  "done!" replies the government official.	5

a woman wanted to know how her husband would react if she left him. she wrote him a letter saying she is tired of him and didn't want to live with him anymore. she put it on the table in the bedroom and then climbed under the bed to hide until her husband got home. when he eventually came back home, he saw the letter on the table and read it. after a few moments of silence, he picked up the pen and added something to the letter. then he started to get changed, whistling happy tunes and singing and dancing while he did so. he grabbed his phone and dialed a number.  his wife listened from under the bed as he started chatting to someone. "hey babe, i'm just changing clothes and then i will join you" he said. "as for the other fool, it finally dawned on her that i was fooling around on her and she left. i was really wrong to have married her; i wish you and me had met earlier. see you soon, honey!" then he hung up and walked out of the room.  heartbroken she climbed out from under the bed and stumbled over to read what her unfaithful husband had written on the end of her letter. through teary eyes, she read: "i could see your feet you idiot, i am going out to buy bread".	5

didn't like shopping there anyway yesterday i was at my local tesco’ store buying a large bag of winalot dog food for my loyal pet and was in the checkout queue when a woman behind me asked if i had a dog.  what did she think i had, an elephant? on impulse i told her that no, i didn't have a dog, i was starting the winalot diet again.   i added that i probably shouldn'’t, because i ended up in hospital last time, but i'd lost 2 stone before i woke up in intensive care with tubes coming out of most of my orifices and ivs in both arms.  i told her that it was essentially a perfect diet and that the way that it works is to load your pockets with winalot nuggets and simply eat one or two every time you feel hungry. the food is nutritionally complete so it works well and i was going to try it again. (i have to mention here that practically everyone in queue was now enthralled with my story.)  horrified, she asked me if i ended up in intensive care because the dog food poisoned me. i told her no, i stepped off the kerb to sniff an irish setter's arse and a car hit me.  i thought the guy behind her was going to have a heart attack he was laughing so hard.   i'm now banned from tesco.	5

a young couple was invited to a swanky masked halloween party a young couple was invited to a swanky masked halloween party. the wife came down with a terrible headache and told her husband to go to the party and have a good time. being the devoted husband, he protested, but she argued and said she was going to take some aspirin and go to bed. she told him there was no need for him to miss the fun. so he took his costume and away he went. the wife, after sleeping soundly for one hour, awakened without pain, and as it was still early, she decided to go to the party. because hubby did not know what her costume was, she thought she would have some kicks watching her husband to see how he acted when she was not around. she joined the party and soon spotted her husband cavorting around on the dance floor. he was dancing with every nice chick he could, and copping a feel here and taking a little kiss there. his wife sidled up to him and, being a rather seductive babe herself, he left his partner high and dry and devoted his time to this new "action". she let him go as far as he wished; naturally, since he was her husband. finally, he whispered a little proposition in her ear and she agreed, so off they went to one of the cars and had a little bang. just before unmasking at midnight, she slipped out, went home and put the costume away and got into bed, wondering what kind of explanation he would have for his notorious behavior. she was sitting up reading when he came in, and she asked him what he had done.  he said, "oh, the same old thing. you know i never have a good time when you're not there."  then she asked, "did you dance much?" he replied, "i'll tell you, i never even danced one dance. when i got to the party, i met pete, bill and some other guys, so we went into the den and played poker all evening. but i'll tell you... the guy that i loaned my costume to sure had one heckuva time!"	4
silence or dishes    joe wanted to buy a motorcycle.  he doesn't have much luck, until one day, he comes across a harley with a for sale sign on it.  the bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old.  it's shiny and in absolute mint condition.  he immediately buys it and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years.  "well, it's quite simple really," says the seller, "whenever the bike is outside and it's gonna rain, rub vaseline on the chrome. it protects it from the rain." (true story)  and he hands joe a jar of vaseline.  that night, his girlfriend, sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. naturally, they take the bike there. but just before they enter the house, sandra stops him and says, "i have to tell you something about my family before we go in."  "when we eat dinner, we don't talk.  in fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes."  "no problem," he says.. and in they go.  joe is shocked. right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes.  in the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes.  they sit down to dinner, and sure enough, no one says a word.  as dinner progresses, joe decides to take advantage of the situation.  so he leans over and kisses sandra. no one says a word.  so he reaches over and fondles her breasts. still, nobody says a word.  so he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table and screws her, right there in front of her parents.  his girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.  he looks at her mom. "she's got a great body," he thinks.  so he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, pulls down her panties, and screws her every which way but loose right there on the dinner table.  after she has a big orgasm, he sits down again. now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, the mom is pleasantly beaming.  but still.... total silence.  all of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder, and it starts to rain.  joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of vaseline from his pocket.  suddenly the father shouted, **"i'll do the fuckin dishes!!"**	5

a guy goes to a female dentist to have a tooth extracted. she pulled out a large syringe to give an anesthetic shot. "no way, no needles! i hate needles!" the man exclaimed.   so she started to hook up the nitrous oxide tank, and the man said, "i can't do the gas thing. just the thought of having a mask on my face suffocates me!"   the dentist then asked the patient if he had any objections to taking a pill. "no," he says, "i'm fine with pills."   so the dentist gave him two little blue pills and he swallowed them. "what are those?" he asked.   "viagra," she replied.    "i'll be damned," said the patient, "i didn't know viagra worked as a pain killer."    "it doesn't," said the dentist, "but it will give you something to hold on to when i pull your tooth."	3

a man met a beautiful girl and he decided he wanted to marry her right away. she protested, “but we don’t know anything about each other.” he replied, “that’s all right; we’ll learn about each other as we go along.” so she consented and they were married, and they went on honeymoon to a very nice resort.   one morning, they were lying by the pool when he got up off his towel, climbed up to the 30-foot high board and did a two-and-a-half-tuck gainer, entering the water perfectly, almost without a ripple. this was followed by three rotations in jack-knife position before he again straightened out and cut the water  like a knife. after a few more demonstrations, he came back and lay down on his towel.   she said, “that was incredible."  he said, “i used to be an olympic diving champion. you see, i told you we’d learn more about ourselves as we went along.”   so she got up, jumped in the pool and started doing laps. she was moving so fast that the ripples from her pushing off at one end of the pool would hardly be gone before she was already touching the other end of the pool. after about thirty laps, completed in mere minutes, she climbed back out and lay down on  her towel, barely breathing hard.   he said, “that was incredible! were you an olympic endurance swimmer?”   “no,” she said, “i was a prostitute in venice and i worked both sides of the canal."	5

"i'll tell you later." the first guy answers.  anyway, they get there and the first guy needs to go in for medical inspection. before he goes into the room he slips 100 dollars between his ass cheeks and walks into the doctor's office.  after a couple of checks the doctor says: "i'm confident you'll make a fine infantryman. i just have to check your backside."  so the guy drops his pants and his underwear and bends over.  "oh dear," the doctor says "i'm afraid i'm going to have to disqualify you, you've got hemorrhoids."  so the guy walks out and tells his friend about it.  "just slip 100 dollars between your ass cheeks and you'll be fine!" he says.  so the guy stands there, thinking about it and about the fact that 100 dollars is a lot of money. so he takes 10 dollars out of his wallet, slips it between his ass cheeks and walks into the doctor's office.  after a couple of checks the doctor says: "i'm confident you'll make a fine infantryman. i just have fo check your backside."  so the doctor checks his backside and says that everything is fine and he passed the test!  the guy turns around and says "what! you just told my friend he was disqualified because of his hemorrhoids!"  "yes," replied the doctor "but his condition is ten times worse!"	4

in the best interest of the child... miami, fl (ap) - a seven-year old boy was at the center of a miami courtroom drama yesterday when he challenged a court ruling over who should have custody of him. the boy has a history of being beaten by his parents and the judge initially awarded custody to his aunt, in keeping with child custody law and regulation requiring that family unity be maintained to the highest degree possible. the boy surprised the court when he proclaimed that his aunt beat him more than his parents and he adamantly refused to live with her. when the judge then suggested that he live with his grandparents, the boy cried and said that they also beat him. after considering the remainder of the immediate family and learning that domestic violence was apparently a way of life among them, the judge took the unprecedented step of allowing the boy to propose who should have custody of him. after two recesses to check legal references and confer with the child welfare officials, the judge granted temporary custody to the miami dolphins, whom the boy firmly believes are not capable of beating anyone.	3

there was once a man who had 100 kids. there was once a man who had 100 kids. he was not a creative man, so he named the kids after the number of their birth. one of his kids, 90, had a few kids when he grew older. one day, they found a dog on the road. they took him in, and named him this. this was a very good and well behaved dog. “dad, i’m going to go feed this.” “hey dad, i’m taking this for a walk.” one day, this went missing. the kids went out to search for him, when they saw him on the side of the road, with skid marks all over his body. years later, the kids still remembered and missed this. moral of the story: only 90s kids will remember this.	4

a horrible accident happened last week while i was replacing the windows at the top of a skyscraper i went up the skyscraper with 2 of my colleagues and it was going great at first. after about an hour i heard a awful scream and i saw one guy falling down and hitting the pavement. it was robert steinberg. he was  dead on impact, nothing we could've done.  i looked at the other guy and asked him "what should we do?"  he told me that one of us had to go and tell his wife, but he didn't want to do it.  so, me and my big mouth said that i'll take care of this.  a couple hours later i returned with a six-pack of beer under my arm.  "weren't you supposed to tell his wife that her husband just died?" my colleague said with a confused look on his face.  "yes, and i did!" i replied.  "so where the hell did you get the six-pack of beer from?" he asked.  "well, it's really simple" i replied.  "i went over to his house and knocked on his door. the window on the first floor opened and his wife said hello. i asked her if this is the house of widow steinberg. she laughed and told me i got the last name right but that she wasn't a widow!" to which i replied: "wanna bet for a six-pack?"	4

"where is god?"  again, the boy made no attempt to answer.  so, the clergyman raised his voice some more and shook his finger in the boy's face and bellowed, "where is god!?"  the boy screamed and bolted from the room. he ran directly home and dove into his closet, slamming the door behind him.  when his older brother found him in the closet, he asked, "what happened?"   the younger brother, gasping for breath, replied: "we are in real big trouble this time! god is missing, and they think we did it!"	3

upon hearing that her elderly grandfather had just passed away, katie went straight to her grandparent's house to visit her 95 year-old grandmother and comfort her. when she asked how her grandfather had died, her grandmother replied, "he had a heart attack while we were making love on sunday morning." horrified, katie told her grandmother that 2 people nearly 100 years old having sex would surely be asking for trouble. "oh no, my dear," replied granny. "many years ago, realizing our advanced age, we figured out the best time to do it was when the church bells would start to ring. it was just the right rhythm. nice and slow and even. nothing too strenuous, simply in on the ding and out on the dong." she paused to wipe away a tear, and continued, "he'd still be alive if the ice cream truck hadn't come along."  fair warning, this is a repost, not oc	1

a police officer was waiting along the side of a highway waiting to catch speeding drivers. there weren't as many violators this day as usual. the state police officer sees an old car puttering along at 22 mph. he thinks to himself, "this driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!" so he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over. approaching the car, he notices that there are five elderly ladies, two in the front seat and three in the back--wide eyed and white as ghosts.  the driver, obviously confused, says to him, "officer, i don't understand, i was doing exactly the speed limit! what seems to be the problem?" "ma'am," the officer replies, "you weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers." "slower than the speed limit? no sir, i was doing the speed limit exactly... twenty-two miles an hour!" the old woman says a bit proudly. the state police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that "22" was the route number, not the speed limit. a bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. "but before i let you go, ma'am, i have to ask... is everyone in this car ok? these women seem awfully shaken and they haven’t uttered a single word this whole time," the officer asks with concern.  "oh, they'll be all right in a minute officer. we just got off route 215."	5

a man takes up kung fu, and ascends high to a mountain temple to train... on his first day he tours the grounds with his master to witness the many fighting styles. along the way he sees a warrior with no arms, and he asks his master "how can that man learn kung fu with no arms?"  "don't you see?" says the master. "without arms he need learn no punches. therefore his path to his own true kung fu is shorter than yours." sure enough, the warrior demonstrates a flurry of elegant, devastating kicks, shattering training dummies before them.  they continue to tour the grounds. the man sees another warrior, this one with no legs. "how can that man learn kung fu with no legs?" asks the student.  "don't you see? without legs he need learn no kicks. he will master true kung fu even quicker!" sure enough, the warrior effortlessly smashes through wood and stone blocks before him.  finally they approach a garden, in it a lone man sits upon a stone in deep meditation. he has no arms and no legs.  his master points to him and says. "whatever you do, never pick a fight with that man."   "i think i understand, wise teacher, surely with no arms or legs, he must already be a true kung fu master!"  "what? no, he will bite your goddamn dick."	3

a redneck and an annoying stranger are sitting next to each other on a 12 hour plane ride... the stranger is pretty well dressed and, after a few drinks becomes very loud and disruptive. he starts boasting that hes the smartest man on the plane. after a few minutes of unsuccessfully trying to get people to engage with him, a stewardess tells the stranger he needs to be quiet and stop disturbing the other passengers.  irritated by this, the stranger nudges the redneck in his dirty boots, cowboy hat, and plaid shirt and said,  "let's talk. i've heard that flights will go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger, and this cabin is full of a bunch of morons."  jimbob, who had just tilted his hat over his eyes to get some sleep, tilted it back up slowly and said to the stranger,  "yeeahp i hear that, whatcha wana talk 'bout?"  "oh, i don't know," said the stranger who began to grin, because he was about to show this dumb redneck how much smarter he is "how about nuclear power?"  "yeeahp. i dont much care for it" said jimbob.  "ok" said the stranger "why dont you ask me a question, and if i can answer it you have to pay for my next drink, and if i cant then ill leave you alone to sleep"  jimbob considers for a moment, then says  "a horse, a cow, and a deer all eat grass - the same stuff. yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. why do you suppose that is?"  after considering for a minute, stranger says "jeez, i have no idea."  "well, then," said jimbob as he tilted his hat back down and leaned his seat back, "how is it that you feel qualified to discuss nuclear power when you don't know shit?	5

a man walked into a bar on the 100th floor of a building, chugged a pint, then jumped out of an open window. ten minutes later, with no injuries, he ran back into the bar, chugged a pint, then jumped out of the same window.  when he returned ten minutes later, a man asked him how he survived.  “you see, alcohol makes you warmer and heat rises. so if you chug a pint really quickly then concentrate really hard as you fall, you temporarily float just before you hit the ground.”  the man was so amazed that he too chugged a pint even faster than the other man, then jumped out of the window. he fell and fell and fell... and then landed on the ground with a splat. he died instantly.  the bartender then turned to the man in the bar and said, “you’re such a dick when you’re drunk, superman.”	5

at the pearly gates in heaven the first applicant of the day at the pearly gates explains that his last day was not a good one...  “i came home early and found my wife lying naked in bed. she claimed she had just got out of the shower. well, her hair was dry and i checked the shower and it was completely dry too. i knew she was into some hanky-panky and i began to look for her lover. i went onto the balcony of our 9th-floor apartment and found the guy clinging to the rail by his fingertips! i was so angry that i began bashing his fingers with a flower pot. he let go and fell, but his fall was broken by some awnings and bushes. on seeing he was still alive i found superhuman strength to drag our antique cedar chest to the balcony and throw it over. it hit the man and killed him. at this point the stress got to me and i suffered a massive heart attack and died.” saint peter thanked him for his story and sent him on to the waiting room. the second applicant said that his last day was his worst. “i was on the roof of an apartment-building working on the ac equipment and i stumbled over my tools and toppled off the building. i managed to grab onto the balcony rail of a 9th-floor apartment but some idiot came rushing out on the balcony and bashed my hands with a flower pot. i fell but hit some awnings and bushes and survived, but as i looked up i saw a huge chest falling toward me. i tried to crawl out of the way but failed and was hit and killed by the chest!” saint peter couldn’t help but chuckle as he directs the man to the waiting room. saint peter is still chuckling when his third customer of the day enters. he apologizes and says, “i doubt that your last day was as interesting as the two fellows that arrived here just before you.” “i don’t know,” replies the man. “picture this, i’m naked, hiding in this cedar chest…”	2

joseph stole my girl... a couple of years ago, one night, i was about to propose to my girlfriend when my roommate joseph barged into the room out of nowhere, tripped and fell over, breaking a glass table with his face. totally ruined the mood. now, i didn't know joseph that well, don't even remember where he was from, but let's just say i put my plans on hold to help him through his injuries.  joseph had gotten big glass shard in his eye, making him completely blind in that eye. he was walking around with one of those cotton pads on his eye for a couple of months. then suddenly, he disappeared, along with my girlfriend  apparently they'd bonded during the time after his injuries, and eloped together , left me behind without as much as a note. i tried to track them down, but never could.  in conclusion, if it hadn't been for cotton eye joe, i'd have been married a long time ago. where did you come from, where did you go? where did you come from, cotton eye joe?	1

this fundamentalist christian couple felt it important to own an equally fundamentally christian pet... this fundamentalist christian couple felt it important to own an equally fundamentally christian pet. so, they went shopping.  at a kennel specializing in this particular breed, they found a dog they liked quite a lot.  when they asked the dog to fetch the bible, he did it in a flash.  when they instructed him to look up psalm 23, he complied equally fast, using his paws with dexterity.  they were impressed, purchased the animal, and went home (piously, of course).  that night they had friends over.  they were so proud of their new fundamentalist dog and his major skills, they called the dog and showed off a little.  the friends were impressed, and asked whether the dog was able to do any of the usual dog tricks, as well.  this stopped the couple cold, as they hadn't thought about "normal" tricks.  well, they said, "let's try this out."  once more they called the dog, and they clearly pronounce the command, "heel!"  quick as a wink, the dog jumped up, put his paw on the man's forehead, closed his eyes in concentration, and bowed his head.	2

"i just paid a $100 extra to get rid of these damn bees and i just got stung!" she barks at the golf pro, sitting behind the counter, working on a putter's grip. he looks up and stops what he's doing.  "well," he says, "where'd you get stung?"  "between the first and second holes!" she says exasperatedly.  the golf pro grins as picks up the putter, continuing with the grip, and says, "ahh...you just need to close up your stance a little."	1
a winter storm blew in from the east during the revolution general washington decided he needed to find a place to stay for him and his 43 men. the first place they found was a farm. the farmer, seeing just how many men the general had knew he couldn’t keep almost most of them on the farm, but was wanted to help the cause so in compromise he agreed to let just one soldier stay. washington and his men talked about it and agreed that alexander cox should be the one to stay; a good soldier who all the men liked and the farm reminded him of home. so washington and his men said their goodbyes to cox and continued their search for shelter. after a few hours they came across a brothel and knocked on the door and the madame soon greeted them and asked what they wanted.  “we need to take shelter until this winter storm passes” general washington said  the madame, worried about all these men around her girls thought about it  “how many of you are there?” she asked cautiously  “forty-two, without cox” general washington answered  “well in that case come on in!” the madame replied with relief.	2

one night at a local bar frequented by a bunch of deer hunters who were waiting for the opening day of deer season, the local sheriff scoped out the joint for possible drunk drivers. as he waited, eventually a patron stumbled out of the bar, fumbled for his keys, tried them in three different cars until he finally found his, got inside and rested his head on the steering wheel. the deputy knew he had his drunk driver, so now all he had to do was wait for him to start his engine and pull out of the lot.  a few hours passed by and most of the other deer hunters had left by then, when the patron abruptly lifted his head, cranked the car up and drove out of the lot like a bat out of hell. the deputy followed him and stopped him promptly. he administered the breath-o-lizer test and it read 0.00.  confused, the deputy asked the driver what the hell was going on. the driver looked at him innocently and said, "well, tonight i'm the designated decoy."	4
