translated a joke from swiss german.

"hi, sir. i would like to take out a loan using my rolls royce as collateral" the woman says to the banker.   "yes ma'am. how much money will you need to borrow?" he asks.  "$500.00 please" says the woman.    "ma'am, that car is easily worth $200,000! are you certain you only want $500?".   she reassures him that is all she needs and she will be back in 30 days to pay the loan balance plus interest in full.   the banker can't believe it, but he writes up the paperwork, has her sign and gives the woman her money. he then orders security to move the car down to the vault where it can be safely stored as collateral. he laughs with his co-worker about how much of a idiot this woman is!  30 days later the woman returns to the bank with $534.00, the amount of the loan plus one month interest, just as she promised.   as the banker is waiting on the car to be brought up, he can't help but ask the woman why she used her $200,000 car on a $500 loan.   she replied "i didn't need the $500 but i was leaving the country for a month and needed a secure place to store my car. $34 is way cheaper than anywhere else in new york."	3

dave and his girlfriend are at a party on a hot day. it’s a good party, everyone is having fun. and eventually the catering comes in, and everyone starts lining up to get their food and drinks. dave’s girlfriend is feeling a bit tired, so dave offers to go up and get her a drink. she happily thanks him and asks for some lemonade just to quench her thirst after a long night of dancing.  so dave goes up to get some lemonade, but there’s a small line. that’s fine, it’s not particularly urgent, so dave starts waiting in line. now, the person ahead of dave turns back around, and realizes it’s dave behind him. so he offers to let dave go ahead, and dave declines, saying he’d prefer not to draw attention to himself.  now the guy in front of dave is a little drunk- how he got drunk on lemonade, i have no idea- and sees this as a bit of a slight. so he starts getting a bit more aggressive, trying to make dave go ahead of him, and he’s starting to freak dave out a bit. now, dave’s no coward, but he certainly doesn’t want a fight to break out, so he excuses himself and heads back to his girlfriend.  he explains that he couldn’t get the lemonade because of a line, and his girlfriend is very understanding. he offers to get her some water instead, and she’s happy. so he goes off to get water.  now, lots of people are in the line for water, it’s a hot day, after all. so he’s waiting, and waiting, and by the time he finally gets to the front, the water ran out.   so someone offers to give dave their water. but before dave can say anything, someone else chimes in with their water. and before long, a fight is about to break out between people trying to prove how generous they are.  so dave quickly says “it’s okay, i don’t want water anymore anyway” and heads out to try and cool the situation down. but of course, he can’t go back for water once they refill it now- everyone knows him, and if they recognize him getting water, a fight might break out again.  so he goes back to his girlfriend again, explaining how the massive line of people stopped him again, and she absolutely gets it again. she says it’s okay, he doesn’t have to get her anything, but dave’s feeling bad now, so dave heads off to get her some punch.  he soon comes back, punch in hand, and his girlfriend says “oh thank you! that was a lot easier than the others!” and she laughs. dave laughs too, takes a sip, and says:  “yep.”	1

so a cherokee family and a white family pull into a restaurant.. white dad sees the cherokee family coming up behind them and purposely let's the door close being a dick instead of holding it politely.   cherokee dad shrugs it off and holds it for his family and follows the white family in. but upon getting to the line the cherokee dad walks right past the white family getting shot some hateful shade for line cutting. to their surprise the hostess smiles and ushers the cherokee dad and his family right past the line and to a table.  30 minutes later waiting in line white dad is fuming, and thinking about leaving. but he can't stop staring at the cherokee family who are laughing and enjoying their food already. cherokee dad meets eyes with him a few times and just politely smiles making white dad's temper all the more spin out of control.  time comes to pay the bill and cherokee dad walks to the counter and politely pays and tips well. but is surprised when white dad walks up and and all but screams "how much longer has my family got to wait, this.. man... and his family skipped line and has already eaten and ready to leave!?!?"  the hostess whom was overcome by such a racial slight as this was very slow to speak.  cherokee dad simply smiles and says "what's the problem white man? i thought you wanted us to have reservations?"	1

"may i know why not?" the man asks.  "well, you see, our database has not been updated yet and the current indication here is that you have not done enough good deeds to go into heaven nor do you have enough bad deeds to go into hell. tell you what, if you can tell me a recent good deed that you did, i will let you in." st peter explained.  the man said: "okay, so one night i was walking home through this dark alley and i passed by this poor girl who was being harassed by a group of ten men. she was crying and looked distressed while the men were laughing and talking crudely to her.  i shouted at them to leave the girl alone, but they just laughed and ignored me. so i went over to this bald guy and slapped the back of his head. i then kicked over one of their bikes and finally i pulled out the nose ring of another guy. because of what i did, the girl was able to escape, unharmed."  st peter was very impressed. "my child, that was wonderful. surely you deserve a place in heaven. just for the sake of updating our database, may i know when did this happen?"  the man replied, "oh, just about five minutes ago."	1

an american investment banker was waiting at the pier of a small coastal mexican village when a small boat with just one fisherman docked inside this boat were several large yellow fin tuna. the banker, complimenting the fisherman on the quality of his fish, asked how long it took to catch them.  the fisherman replied, “only one hour". the banker, impressed, asked why didn’t he stay out longer if the fish were biting so much? the fisherman replied saying he had enough for his family over the weekend. the banker then asked, “ but how will you spend the rest of your day?”  the fisherman smiled, saying, “i sleep late, fish a little, then i play with my children, take siestas with my wife, stroll into the village each evening where i sip wine and play guitar with my amigos. i have a full and busy life.”   the banker scoffed, “i am a harvard mba and could help you. you should spend more time fishing and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. with the proceeds from the bigger boat, you could buy several boats, eventually you would have a fleet of fishing boats. instead of selling your catch to a middleman you would sell directly to the processor, eventually opening your own cannery. you would control the product, processing, and distribution. you would need to leave this small coastal fishing village and move to mexico city, then la and eventually new york city, where you will run your expanding enterprise.”  the fisherman asked, “but how long would all this take?”  to which the banker replied, “oh, about 15 – 20 years if you work hard.”  “but what then?” asked the fisherman.  the banker laughed, saying, “well, this is the best part. when the time is right, you would announce an ipo and sell your company stock to the public and become very, very rich, you would make millions!”  “millions? well then what?”  the banker gesturing grandly said, “well, then you would retire. move to a small coastal fishing village where you would sleep late, fish a little, play with your kids, take siestas with your wife, stroll to the village in the evenings where you could sip wine and play your guitar with your amigos.”	3

an irishman walks into a bar. he orders three pints of guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. when he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.  the bartender approaches and tells him, “you know, a pint goes flat after i draw it, and it would taste better if you bought one at a time.” the irishman replies, well, you see, i have two brothers. one is in america, the other is in australia, and i’m in dublin.  when we all left home, we promised that we’d drink this way to remember the days we drank together. so i drink one for each o’me brothers and one for me self.” the bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. the irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way: he orders three pints and drinks them in turn.  one day, he comes in and orders two pints. all the other regulars take notice and fall silent. when he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, “i don’t want to intrude on your grief, but i wanted to offer my condolences on your loss.”  the irishman looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns and he laughs. “oh, no, everybody’s just fine,” he explains, “it’s just that my wife had us join that baptist church and i had to quit drinking. but it hasn’t affected me brothers though.”	3

4 husbands the local news station was interviewing an 80-year-old lady because she had just gotten married for the fourth time.  the interviewer asked her questions about her life, about what it felt like to be marrying again at 80, and then about her new husband's occupation.  "he's a funeral director," she answered.  "interesting," the newsman thought.  he then asked her if she wouldn't mind telling him a little about her first three husbands and what they did for a living. she paused for a few moments, needing time to reflect on all those years. after a short time, a smile came to her face and she answered proudly, explaining that she had first married a banker when she was in her 20's, then a circus ringmaster when in her 40's, and a preacher when in her 60's, and now - in her 80's - a funeral director.  the interviewer looked at her, quite astonished, and asked why she had married four men with such diverse careers.   she smiled and explained,  "i married one for the money, two for the show, three to get ready, and four to go."	3

a guy is constantly suffering from terrible headaches... a guy is constantly suffering from terrible headaches. he goes to a bunch of doctors, runs any test imaginable, and no one can figure out why. one day a doctor tells him- “i think we figured out a solution, but you’re not going to like it. if we cut off your balls, the constant headache will stop”. the guy was shocked, but he didn’t want to continue the torture, so he agreed.  after the procedure, the pain suddenly went away. he was relieved that the headache was finally gone, but still felt terrible, because he didn’t feel like a man anymore.  in order to cheer himself up, he went to an expensive store to get himself a tailored suit. the tailor, who spent 50 years working there was a real pro and said that he doesn’t need to take measurements, he can just correctly guess every size.  at first the guy didn’t believe but the tailor gave him a pair of pants that fit just perfectly. then the tailor gave him a dress shirt, that fit exactly right, without any measurements. then the tailor gave him a jacket, that also fit perfectly, the guy was amazed.  the tailor said : “let’s also get you some silk underwear, it is very nice. from looking at you , i can tell you wear large. ” the guy suddenly says: “nope! you’re finally wrong. i wear small, looks like even you aren’t perfect” the tailor: “sir, i’ve been a tailor for 50 years, your underwear size is definitely large. if you were wearing small, it would squeeze your balls so tight that you would suffer from constant headaches”   edit: spelling	3

a well-dressed man, complete with top hat and monocle, walks into a bar. the bartender, who has seen it all, pours the dapper gentleman two fingers of their top-shelf 25-year-old scotch. just as the man begins nursing the peaty, smoky booze, a rabbi, a priest, and a minister all walk into the bar, arguing about how to prove the existence of their respective gods.  moments later, as the bartender is busy filling their orders, three women; a blonde, brunette, and a redhead, walk into the bar. apparently, each just had a bizarre encounter with a traffic cop, and needed a drink as they swapped stories and advice.   soon, a mathematician, a physicist, and the dean of the local college swept through the door. they were engaged in some heated debate about something so profound and obscure, it was difficult for the bartender to even parse out the topic that has his customers so riled up! still, the bartender is a professional, and after a few minutes of trying to get their attention, he finally gets their orders and begins filling them. in the meantime, the dapper gentleman signaled for another splash of the good stuff, and the bartender is pleased to note a $100 bill peaking out from under the empty glass. he rushes to fill this, as well as a half-dozen other orders.  he barely got the peanut bowls refilled when the door opens once again, this time admitting an old cowboy (whose horse, much to the bartender's surprise, is tied to a hitching post he never noticed before), and what appeared to be a wwii-era sailor. both needed a drought of his strongest stuff, pronto. the bartender risks stepping away from the bar to slip into the storage room. there, he digs out an ancient, dusty bottle of that ol' widowmaker. according to legend, wyatt earp once took a swig from this very bottle before riding out on his vendetta against the cowboys. the bartender knew this was bullshit, but hey, the customers liked the story well enough, and they always seemed willing to pay the exorbitant price for a single shot. the cowboy and the sailor silently downed their shots, and while never breaking eye-contact, silently dared the other to grimace. as this contest of masculinity raged on, the door opened once more.  a man of absolutely no outlandish characteristics walks in. he takes the final empty stool at the bar. the bartender actually breathes a sigh of relief, but then gasps the breath right back in when the man pulls a ten-inch pianist and correspondingly small but fully-functional piano out of his satchel. the tiny piano player immediate sits down and begins banging out some 1930's-era ragtime piece. the bartender decides he should make his rounds before confronting this new strangeness.  just as the bartender made his way back to the bar after making a wide circuit among his eclectic customers, a young man approached him with a bet: that he, the young man, could pee into a shot glass placed at one end of the bar while he stood on the other end, without spilling a single drop. that was when the bartender noticed a small group of similar young men at the pool tables. they were watching the developing scene with keen interest.  that was it. flabbergasted, the bartender stood up on top of the bar, and at the top of his voice, yelled, *"what is this, some kind of joke?!?"*	2

the ending is massive. a shoe factory specializing in intelligent shoes contacted me, and asked me whether i wanted to try their new smart shoes.  it was free of charge, so i accepted the offer.  first, i asked the shoes to take me to the best burger place in town. and indeed, the shoes walked me right into the best burger i had ever eaten.  knowing i could trust the shoes, i next asked them to take me to get a gift for my wife. it was our anniversary.  the shoes walked me right into a jewelry store, and stopped in front of a beautiful necklace. i bought it.  happy with my purchase, i asked the shoes to walk me home. there i gave the gift to my wife; she said it was beautiful, and told me she loved me very much.  however, i wasn't done yet. it was a sinful, awful thought, i know, but i couldn't resist the temptation:  lastly i asked the shoes to take me to the best hooker in town.  this time, however, the shoes failed me: they led me to a church, where a priest was giving a sermon on the 6th commandment.  "hmmm... there must be a bug in the programming", i thought at first. but pretty soon it dawned on me what had happened:  these shoes had good soles.	2

"good god!" his wife replied, "don't do that, you'll injure yourself and then you'll lose your job"  "don't worry, i definitely won't," the man assures his wife.   the next day he goes off to work, and when he comes home his wife asks, "how was your second day at the pickle factory?"  "great!" he tells her, "this is the best job i've ever had. the problem is, by the end of my shift i found myself once again wanting to put my penis in the pickle-slicer"  "what the hell is the matter with you?! that's crazy!" she tells him.  "what's worse is that i almost worked up the courage to do it," he explains, "but then i realized what a terrible idea it would be and how disappointed you'd be if i lost this job"  the woman tells her husband, "well if you feel that urge tomorrow, don't do it! just call me and i'll try to talk some sense into you"  the next day the man goes off to work again and about three hours later the wife receives a phone call from her husband.   "honey, i'm so sorry, i tried to fight it all day but just before lunch i caught myself staring at the pickle slicer and i couldn't control myself any longer. i pulled down my pants and put my penis right inside of the pickle-slicer!"  his wife screams, "no! oh god, no! are you okay? did you get in trouble?"  he calmly explains to her "well, you were right, i did lose my job".   "i bet you did, she exclaimed, "but what about the pickle-slicer?" she asked.  "oh yeah," he replies, "she lost her job too".	3

"i'm always looking for the next job,"  says the duck.  "where is it?"  "at the circus,"  says the barman.  "the circus?"  repeats the duck.  "that's right,"  replies the barman.

"of course," the barman replies.  "and the tent has canvas sides and a big canvas roof with a hole in the middle?" persists the duck.  "that's right!" says the barman.  the duck shakes his head in amazement, and says .. . ......   "what the fuck would they want with a plasterer??!"	3

wisdom in age 1.  when i was 13, i hoped that one day i would have a girlfriend with big tits.   2.  when i was 16, i got a girlfriend with big tits, but there was no passion, i decided i needed a passionate girl with zest for life.   3.  in college i dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional.  everything was an emergency.  she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.  i decided i needed a girl with stability.   4.  when i was 25, i found a very stable girl but she was boring.  she was totally predictable and never got excited about anything.  life became so dull that i decided i needed a girl with some excitement.   5.  when i was 30, i found an exciting girl, but i couldn't keep up with her.  she rushed from one thing to another, never settling on anything.  she did mad impetuous things and made me miserable as often as happy.  she was great fun initially and very energetic, but directionless.  i decided to find a  girl with some real ambition.   6.  when i turned 40, i found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted firmly on the ground, i married her.  she was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything i owned.    7.  i'm much older and wiser now, and i'm looking for a girl with big tits.	1

so, this is a very famous joke from my country ,i hope to see the response a conference for who the best actor in the world was held, actors from all around the world came to take part in the competition.there were many qualifier rounds but then only 5 actors remained in the finals.  the final contest was decided to be a manual cow milking competition. the rules were simple, the one to milk the most milk from their respective cows won the competition.  the actors were from nepal (the place where the joke is from), india (a neighbouring country so it is used), usa (land of chuck norris), uk  and china.  they were each given a cow and 1 hour of alloted time to milk the cow.  the competition started and then ended soon.  then the judges went on and checked how much they each milked.  they went and checked uk's representative (michael caine). he only milked 10 ltrs. of milk.  then they moved onto china's jet li. using his martial arts technique, he milked an astonishing 20 ltr. of milk from the cow.  then rajnikant (indian counterpart of chuck norris,ask indians they'll tell) patted li on the back and showed them he had milked 25 ltrs.   chuck norris was already laughing at them. for he had milked 30 ltrs. of milk  now, the judges moved onto rajesh hamal (he's the nepalese counterpart to chuck norris). when they looked into his bucket, they were astounded. he had only milked 1 ltr. of milk     they declared chuck to be the winner and later interviewed everyone.    when it was rajesh's turn, they asked " why only 1 ltr?"   to which he replied "those mfers gave me a bull"	3

"what's that big  thing hanging off the elephant, daddy?"  "that's his trunk, son," dad said.  "no, daddy, not his trunk, and not his tail. i mean that big thing underneath, by his belly," johnny repeated.  "oh, that," dad said. "that's his penis, johnny."  "huh," mused the five year old.

a team of nazi spies parachutes in britain during ww2. they're all well-trained, they know their mission, they have their legends. but when they're still above the ocean, suddenly a terrible thunderstorm hits them. the hurricane scatters them, some of them smash into the cliffs, others hit the waves and drown. only one last spy, by sheer luck or miracle, manages to survive and reach the shore. he crawls out of the water, numb with cold, fumbles with his straps for what seems like an eternity and finally manages to stand up, dressed in civilian clothes but wet to the bone.  &#x200b;  he doesn't even care for his mission at this point. he limps along the beach under the chilling wind, shaking, driven by one thought -- get warm. the rest will wait, he'll sort it out assoon as he recovers from this terrible ordeal. he climbs the cliff, almost blind in the dead of night, barely gets up -- and then he sees a distant light!  &#x200b;  the light is warm and orange, a speck of amber against the pitch-black sky. the spy rushes towards it, still limping, tumbles down, springs back to his feet and keeps running under the pouring rain -- if only he could get warm! as the light gets closer, the spy realizes it's a window, lit with a tender light. exhausted, he still darts forward, almost slipping on the wet stones, and he sees a pub, a good old irish pub, homy and welcoming, but above all -- warm!  &#x200b;  he opens the wooden door and walks in, drags himself straight to the fireplace and for a couple of minutes just stands there, reaching out to the fire, soaking up the heat. only after he's come to his senses a bit, he stumps across to the counter, still trembling, greets the bartender with a weak smile and stutters out:  &#x200b;  'whiskey, please.'  'dry?'  'nein, zwei.'	2

"aren't they white shoes?" he asks.  "yes!"   "let me check my storage."   from the back of the shop, he shouts:  "they are loafers, right?"   "well yes!!"   "with blue stiches??"

my first dog was named victory... ...because my parents never let me have a pet when i was a kid. i was so happy to have her that i took her out for walks every day. one day, we were passing the beach, and i decided it would be nice to let her go for a swim. it was hot out, after all. unfortunately, the local beach had an infamous shark that bit off a foot from 3 different people, so everyone called it 'feet'. i was keeping an eye on my dog, like any responsible pet owner, when i see a fin surface and begin approaching my dog. i immediately rush out into the water, terrified that she'll be eaten. at the last minute, i was able to snatch victory from the jaws of the feet.	2

the spitfire pilot a world war ii spitfire pilot is speaking in a church and reminiscing about his war experiences.  "in 1942," he says, "the situation was really tough. the germans had a very strong air force. i remember," he continues, "one day i was protecting the bombers and suddenly, out of the clouds, these fokkers appeared."  there are a few gasps from the parishioners, and several of the children began to giggle.  "i looked up, and realized that two of the fokkers were directly above me. i aimed at the first one and shot him down. by then, though, the other fokker was right on my tail."  at this point, several of the elderly ladies of the church were blushing with embarrassment, the girls were all giggling and the boys laughing loudly.  the pastor finally stands up and says, "i think i should point out that 'fokker' was the name of a german-dutch aircraft company, who made many of the planes used by the germans during the war."  "yes, that's true," says the old pilot, "but these fokkers were flying messerschmitts."	1

i just started my job as a minister's assistant my local church just hired me to assist the minister, and so far the job is going very well. the only real challenge is that he's very particular about the display towards the front of the sanctuary. he insists that it be kept spotless at all times, decorated with the freshest flowers, and have every detail placed perfectly on it. after a few weeks of this, i decided to ask him about it.  "excuse me, pastor" i asked. "why are you so fixated on the front display?"  "oh, that" he replied. "it's just my altar ego."	2

i lost my hat one sunday before a church service, a priest notices a man sitting in a pew who he has not seen in years.  the priest approaches and says, "wow! i can't remember the last time i saw you here! what brings you here today?"  the man replies, "good morning, father! well you see, ten years ago i lost my hat and i have come to get it back!"  the priest replies, "ten years? what makes you think it would be here after all that time?"  "good question father," replies the man. "it's not exactly my hat, but i know that solomon comes here every sunday and he wears the same hat. so i figured that when he goes into confession, i'll just nip on over and take it for myself!"  the priest is a bit disappointed, but leaves the man to his devices.  the service goes on as normal, and afterwards the priest notices that the man is still sitting there with no hat.  "well," says the priest. "looks like you changed your mind! i'm glad!"  the man replies, "oh yes, father! you see, i was going to take solomon's hat, but i was listening to your service this morning and it really resonated with me. i especially enjoyed the part about the ten commandments!"  with a bit of smugness, the priest says, "ah, so you must have liked the part about 'thou shalt not steal'?"  "not quite, father," says the man. "it was actually the one about 'thou shalt not commit adultery' and i remembered where i left my hat!"	1

richard's new job richard just got a new job on a small shipping vessel. he shows up for his first day and the first mate puts him to work loading crates onto the ship. he finishes a few hours later and they get underway. richard is put to work and is kept busy all day. after dinner, he approaches the first mate and says, "hey. i forgot to ask. what are we even shipping on this trip?"  &#x200b;  the first mate looks at him, pauses for a moment, and says: "here. i'll show you."  &#x200b;  they go down to the cargo hold where richard was loading crates earlier.  the first mate pries open one of the crates and pulls out the strangest potato richard has ever seen. it's much longer and skinnier than a normal potato and has a bulge near the top and two bulges near the bottom. the first mate hands it to richard, who takes it, slightly stunned, and says, "this looks like a giant..."  &#x200b;  "...penis, yes." the first mate finishes richard's sentence. "it's called a herm potato. they all look like that. the captain signed an exclusivity deal to ship these. they're all we transport now." the first mate took the potato back as richard burst into laughter. "go ahead, laugh, get it out now," said the first mate, "you'll be dealing with crates upon crates of these. it's best you get accustomed to them." after richard calmed down, they put the potato back and went to their bunks for the night. the next day, they delivered their cargo without incident.  &#x200b;  richard works on the ship for the next few months without incident. on one of his nights off, he goes to a local bar to have a drink. he strikes up a conversation with the guy sitting next to him and mentions that he works for a shipping vessel. the guy turns to him and says, "what a coincidence. my usual transport boat cancelled at the last minute and i need some eggs shipped asap. i'll be honest, i'm pretty desperate here and you can pretty much name your price." richard takes the guy's business card and promises to see what he can do.  &#x200b;  the next day, richard goes to the first mate and explains about the guy at the bar. the first mate shakes his head and says, "i'm sorry, but the captain signed an exclusivity deal and he takes it very seriously. i wouldn't even bother bringing it up with him."   &#x200b;  richard isn't deterred, however, and brings it up the next time he sees the captain. the captain cuts him off mid-sentence and says, "no. absolutely not. we already have a contract and we're not breaking it."   &#x200b;  deflated, richard looks at the captain and says, "shouldn't we at least let the crew vote on it?"  &#x200b;  the captain explodes in anger and shouts, "vote? what makes you think this is a democracy? this is my vessel, and as long as i am captain it will remain a dick tater ship."	1

while riding my harley, i swerved to avoid hitting a deer, lost control and landed in a ditch, severely banging my head. dazed and confused, i crawled out of the ditch to the edge of the road when a shiney new convertible pulled up with a very beautiful woman who asked, "are you okay?"  as i looked up, i noticed she was wearing a low cut blouse with cleavage to die for...  "i'm okay i think," i replied as i pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.  she said, “get in and i’ll take you home so i can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.”  "that's nice of you," i answered, but i don't think my wife will like me doing that !  "oh, come now, i’m a nurse," she insisted. "i need to see if you have any more scrapes and then treat them properly."  well, she was really pretty and very persuasive. being sort of shaken and weak, i agreed, but repeated, "i'm sure my wife won't like this."  we arrived at her place which was just few miles away and, after a couple of cold beers and the bandaging, i thanked her and said, "i feel a lot better, but i know my wife is going to be really upset so i'd better go now."  "don't be silly!" she said with a smile, while unbuttoning her blouse exposing the most beautiful set of boobs i’ve ever seen.  "stay for a while. she won't know anything. your wife will still be there when you get home".  “oh, she’s not at home.”  “where is she?”  “still in the ditch with the harley...”	1

a sensitive guy (nsfw-ish) a woman meets a man in a bar. they talk; they connect; they end up leaving together.      they get back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment, she notices that one wall of his bedroom is completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddy bears. there are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears, carefully placed in rows covering the entire wall!      it was obvious that he had taken quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.       there were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running all the way along the top shelf.       she found it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large a collection of teddy bears, but doesn't mention this to him, and actually is quite impressed by his sensitive side.       they share a bottle of wine and continue talking and, after a while, she finds herself thinking, "oh my god! maybe, this guy could be the one! maybe he could be the future father my children?" she turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips. he responds warmly.     they continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.   she is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion, more creativity, more heat than she has ever known.   after an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy, they are lying there together in the afterglow.       the woman rolls over, gently strokes his chest and asks coyly, "well, how was it?"   the guy gently smiles at her, strokes her cheek, looks deeply into her eyes, and says, "help yourself to any prize from the middle shelf."	3

garden snakes can be dangerous a couple in sweetwater, texas, had a lot of potted plants. during a recent cold spell, the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze.  it turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants. when it had warmed up, it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa.  she let out a very loud scream.  the husband (who was taking a shower) ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was. she told him there was a snake under the sofa.  he got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it. about that time the family dog came and cold-nosed him on the behind. he thought the snake had bitten him, so he screamed and fell over on the floor.  his wife thought he had had a heart attack, so she covered him up, told him to lie still, and called an ambulance.  the attendants rushed in, would not listen to his protests, loaded him on the stretcher, and started carrying him out.  about that time, the snake came out from under the sofa and the emergency medical technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher. that's when the man broke his leg and why he is still in the hospital.  the wife still had the problem of the snake in the house, so she called on a neighbor who volunteered to capture the snake. he armed himself with a rolled-up newspaper and began poking under the couch.. soon he decided it was gone and told the woman, who sat down on the sofa in relief.  but while relaxing, her hand dangled in between the cushions, where she felt the snake wriggling around. she screamed and fainted, the snake rushed back under the sofa.  the neighbor man, seeing her lying there passed out, tried to use cpr to revive her.  the neighbor's wife, who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store, saw her husband's mouth on the woman's mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods, knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches.  the noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him, so she assumed that the snake had bitten him. she went to the kitchen and got a small bottle of whiskey, and began pouring it down the man's throat.  by now, the police had arrived.  breathe here...  they saw the unconscious man, smelled the whiskey, and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred. they were about to arrest them all, when the women tried to explain how it all happened over a little garden snake!  the police called an ambulance, which took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife.  now, the little snake again crawled out from under the sofa and one of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it. he missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table. the table fell over, the lamp on it shattered, and, as the bulb broke, it started a fire in the drapes.  the other policeman tried to beat out the flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog who, startled, jumped out and raced into the street, where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car.  meanwhile, neighbors saw the burning drapes and called in the fire department. the firemen had started raising the fire ladder when they were halfway down the street. the rising ladder tore out the overhead wires, put out the power, and disconnected the telephones in a ten-square city block area (but they did get the house fire out).  time passed! both men were discharged from the hospital, the house was repaired, the dog came home, the police acquired a new car and all was right with their world.  a while later they were watching tv and the weatherman announced a cold snap for that night. the wife asked her husband if he thought they should bring in their plants for the night.  and that's when he shot her.	2

a man going on a business trip visits a witch doctor for his wife he explains to the witch doctor that his wife has a very high sex drive and he wants to make sure she can satisfy herself while hes gone. no ordinary item will do.  the witch doctor nods and says "i have just the right thing." and he pulls out a box. "this is a voodoo dick. it is quite easy to use. simply say "voodoo dick" and the part you want it to fuck and it will start."  so the man buys it and gifts it to his wife before going on his trip. the day after hes gone, the wife decides to try it out. she reads the instructions and says "voodoo dick, my vagina."  and sure enough, the dick starts fucking her. it's great and keeps going for a long time. after she gets off, however, she realizes a problem. she doesnt know how to make it stop.  the witch doctor's address is on the box, though, so she hops in her car and starts trying to drive there. all the while the voodoo dick is still going at it. shes swerving on the road and ends up being pulled over.  the police very sternly asks her "have you been drinking? you were all over the road."  "no officer," the wife replies. "its this voodoo dick. it wont stop fucking me."  clearly not believing her, the officer scoffs and says "voodoo dick my ass."	3

"that's enough," she sputtered. "i -- i can't believe this! monday morning, i expect an explanation for this behavior!"  on monday morning, the teacher confidently entered the classroom and found on the board: "don't you know -- the more you rub it, the bigger it gets?"	2

i want to try with an ancient chinese joke and see if it works. a man with a small dick wants to find a wife. he’s afraid to be laughed at for his size so he insists to find a true virgin. and he thinks of a clever way.  the man marries a woman, shows her his dick and asks her: “what is this?” the woman replies: “it’s your penis.” the man knows that she is not a virgin and kicks her away.  he marries another woman, shows her his dick and asks her: “what’s this?” the woman replies: “it’s your dick.” the man sees that the woman even knows its nickname so definitely not a virgin. he kicks her away too.  at last he marries a very young woman. he does the same and she replies “i don’t know.” the man is more than happy because he finally finds a true virgin, so he grabs his dick and teaches her: “this is called a penis.”  the young woman shakes her head and says: “no way! i’ve seen quite a lot of penises, and it’s impossible it can be small like this!”	3

cinderella wants to go to the ball, but her wicked stepmother won't let her… as cinderella sits crying in the garden, her fairy godmother appears and promises to provide cinderella with everything she needs to go to the ball, but only on two conditions.  "first, you must wear a diaphragm."   cinderella agrees.  "what's the second condition?"  "you must be home by 2 a.m. any later and your diaphragm will turn into a pumpkin."  cinderella agrees to be home by 2 a.m.  the appointed hour comes and goes and cinderella doesn't show up.   finally, at 5 a.m., cinderella shows up, looking love-struck and very satisfied.  "where have you been?" demands the fairy godmother. "your diaphragm was supposed to turn into a pumpkin three hours ago!!!"  "i met a prince, fairy godmother. he took care of everything."  "i know of no prince with that kind of power! tell me his name!"  "i can't remember, exactly... peter peter, something or other..."  edit: missed the g spot in diaphragm!	2

a man sees an ad, which promises the client to loose either 5, 10 or 20 pounds in one day but doesn't mention any kind of method. so, since he is curious to how the company wants to achieve that, he calls them and purchases the first and cheapest offer, which states that he will loose 5 pounds in a day. the next day a pretty lady shows up. she is wearing nothing but sport shoes and a sign that says : “catch me and you can do wathever you want to me“. without thinking twice, he runs after her, but since she is quite athletic that takes some time. finally after an hour, he catches her and they fuck. the next day he weighs himself and is pleased to see that he really lost 5 pounds.  a few days after he deceides to call again and purchase the more expensive offer that states that you will loose 10 pounds in a day. long story short, the next day a even more charming lady shows up, wearing nothing but shoes and the sign, but she is also more athletic than the first one and so he chases her for 3 hours, catches her and they fuck. again, as promised he looses the 10 pounds.  fast forward a few days more, and he deceides to purchase the most expensive offer, in hopes for a even more gorgeous lady. the next day, as expected, his bell rings again. he already is dressed in his sport clothes and cannot wait to chase the last lady. as he opens the door though, much to his suprise, there isn't a barely covered lady, but a barely covered, 6'4“ tall, buff man, who is also quite well hung. he as well wears sport shoes and a sign, which says: “i'm gay and if i catch you, i can do to you whatever i want. you get a headstart of 10 seconds“	2

"you're kidding. does that actually work?"  "sure, i do it all the time. never failed me!"  &#x200b;  some time later, john returns home. when he walked into his bedroom, he saw that his wife was already asleep. still, the conversation stuck with him, so he snuck into the bathroom, whipped out his dick and whacked the edge of the sink with it.  that's when he heard his wife yelling from the bedroom: "charlie, is that you?"	2

a man holding several miniature pigs walks into a bar. "hey, barkeep!" he says, struggling to keep control of his quarry. "any room for me and my friends?"   the bartender smiles and sets down some plastic cups. the man plops his friends inside, but the cups are too small.  "um...barkeep?" the man says, pulling them out again. the bartender reaches for some larger mugs, but as he places them next to the cups, it becomes obvious that even these will be too small for the pigs.   seeing the man struggle to continue holding them, the bartender runs to the kitchen for help.  a cook emerges, holding several large measuring cups. "sorry, i just used these to make a batch of cheese dip, but they're all yours!"    the man carefully plops each pig into its respective gooey yellow cup.   arms exhausted, breathing heavily, he drops into a stool at the end of the bar, between his tiny friends and a beautiful girl.   he glances her way, gasping coyly. "hey...i'm...tom."   she smiles, having watched the whole ordeal. "hi tom, i'm liz. and if you don't mind me asking..." she laughs, looking over his shoulder, "what was *that* all about?"  he glances back at the bar. "yeah...sorry," he pants. "i wanted...to impress you, but...it turned out to be...a pretty cheesy...pig-cup line."	3

a marine returns from duty in iraq and is immediately reassigned to a remote location in afghanistan. that evening he arrives at his new post; a run down mosque in the middle of nowhere.  as he switches over with the marine currently stationed there, he realises there is no bed, no clean water, no toilet, just him, his weapon and the dirt on the floor.  the next morning he wakes up to find a queue of naked men leading into the mosque. at the front, the mosque leader is in prayer with the man leading the line.  as the prayer finishes, he drops to his knees and swings his fist into the naked guys balls, flooring him! the naked guy slowly comes to his senses and crawls out of the mosque.  confused, the marine asks the mosque leader what's going on...  "these men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over afghanistan." he says, "instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive allah's justice, then return home."  the marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.  after 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.  "hey, my last post was in korea, how is it here?" asks the replacement. "and what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?"  "well, i'll be honest with you", replies the marine, "this a shit post, and what you're looking at here is a criminal punch line."	2

a man starts a new job on a construction site. the site is 500 miles away from anybody else but it pays good so he's happy to start. on his first day the foreman is showing him around the job site. where he will be working, sleeping, and everything else.    while on tour, the man notices a line of men waiting to go behind a wooden fence. the man asks about it and the foreman explains that there isn't a woman within 500 miles and if he gets horny to go stick his dick in the hole that's in the barrel back behind the fence.    after about the third day on the job site, that barrel started sounding tempting. after work, he stood in line, went behind the fence, and stuck his dick in the hole in the barrel. it was like heaven to him. it was the best he had ever felt. after that you couldn't keep this man from standing in line to go behind the fence.    one morning, the man gets his tools and starts walking to his work site and the foreman yells to him, "you don't need your tools! it's your turn inside the barrel!"	2

a man wakes up a man wakes up in a dimly lit room with three doors. on each door, there is a picture of a different type of food. the first door has a picture of eggs, second has a picture of cereal and the third has a picture of beans.   the man decides to try the first door, so he opens it. behind it is a beautiful woman with three eggs for breasts. she says, “egg tits? you can have as much as you like!” of course, the man accepts. the woman could make her chest transform into any kind of dish as long as it was only eggs. omelets, deviled, poached, scrambled, of the man could name it, it would be there. however, the food was never seasoned, so it always tasted a bit dull.   he eats nothing but eggs for a solid month and has great sex with the triple breasted woman almost every six hours, but soon, he gets bored of the same meal and same woman. so, he decides to open the second door.   behind the second door, there lies an even more beautiful woman, but this time she has two literal jugs on her chest filled with cereal. “jug tits?” the new woman asked. she had hardly finished her sentence before the man was on top of her, eating. the man has never been happier in his life, not that he could remember anything before he got to the mysterious room. the woman, like the last one, could create any type of cereal he wanted. lucky charms, trix, honey bunches of oats, even certain types of granola were manageable.   the next two and a half months, the man eats eggs and cereal while he searches for a way out, never deciding to open the third door as to not add a new food to his palate so he doesn’t get bored. however, the room seems impenetrable.   the morning of the fourth week, the man wakes up and the eggs and cereal are tasteless. the man wished that there could be some milk to go with the cereal or some bacon for the eggs, but alas the women could only conjure up their specific item. after a while, the women grew unhappy with him and begged him to open the third door. they said that maybe there would be a way out.   the man sighed, despaired, and knew he had waited long enough, so finally, he threw open the third and final door, labeled beans. the woman inside had one can of beans for a breast and she smiled at the man. the man screamed, “oh my god! not another one of you! i can’t handle any more of this! can this get any worse?”  the woman replied, grinning, “can tit?”	2

two leafs fans die and go to hell the devil greets them at the gate and shows them to their new home. having lived in northern ontario their whole lives, the two men are excited to enjoy hell's warmer climate. they immediately shed a few layers and kick back with a couple cold beers. the devil, none too pleased with their enthusiasm heads down to the boiler room and ups the temperature in their room to 35°.  later on, the devil goes to check on the two canadians. much to his dismay, he finds that they have thrown a party in their room. he storms back down to the boiler room and sets the temperature to 45°. this kills the mood pretty quickly and the party soon clears out. but the two men are still enjoying the warmest climate they've ever experienced. the devil, now furious, marches back down to the boiler room with one last trick up his sleeve: he shuts the heat down completely.  when he returns a little while later, he finds the two men in their natural habitat, bundled up in a few layers sharing their favourite hockey stories with some fellow canadians they met at the party.  then, everyone goes silent. the devil excitedly presses his ear to the door and peeps in. one of the men points to the centre of the floor and says "look!": frost was starting to form. it spread up the walls and across the ceiling, soon the floor was covered in a layer of sheet ice. the two men jump up and start celebrating like children.  the devil, furiously barges in and yells "why are you so happy? why aren't you suffering?"  "hell froze over!" they replied, **"the leafs won the cup!!!"**	2
the secret of the monks a man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. he goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, "my car broke down. do you think i could stay the night?"  the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. as the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. a sound unlike anything he's ever heard before. the sirens that nearly seduced odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. he doesn't sleep that night. he tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.  the next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, "we can't tell you. you're not a monk." distraught, the man is forced to leave.  years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.  the monks reply, "we can't tell you. you're not a monk." the man says, "if the only way i can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk."  the monks reply, "you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. when you find these answers, you will have become a monk."  the man sets about his task.   after years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. a monk answers. he is taken before a gathering of all the monks.  "in my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, i traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: by design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. only god knows what you ask. all a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception."  the monks reply, "congratulations. you have become a monk. we shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound."  the monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, "the sound is beyond that door."  the monks give him the key, and he opens the door. behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. the man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. and so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.  finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. the sound has become very clear and definite. the monks say, "this is the last key to the last door."  the man is apprehensive to no end. his life's wish is behind that door! with trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound......  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  ...  but, of course, i can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.	1

a female student was walking towards her locker when she noticed a post-it-note on the locker door. she looked at it and it was the classic “why did the chicken cross the road?” joke. she didn’t really laugh as she heard it a million times, so she crumpled it up and threw it in the back of her locker.   the next day, another note was posted onto her locker and it read the *same* joke! she was slightly annoyed, but it didn’t really matter at this point. she crumpled it up and went about her day.   the third day, yet another note was posted onto her locker door and as expected, it had the same old joke on it. she was growing irritated and ripped it up before throwing it in the trash.   later that day, she has talking to one of her senior friends at lunch, and she mentions these notes she has gotten for 3 days now. her friends laughs and says “oh, you’re getting them now?”  she was very confused now, and asked her friend “what do you mean? do other people get these notes?”  her friend explained the whole thing. “you see, there is this weird kid that puts the same joke on different lockers using a post-it, and watches them find it. if they read it, he puts the same note up the next day. if they don’t read it, he gives up and goes onto the next person.”    at this point, the girl starts to laugh and says “are you serious? this can’t be real!”  her friend laughs and says, “once you have read it, it’s just re-post after re-post”.	3

the boss of a mining company is trying to decide which of his 3 sons to promote, so he gives them a test he sits them all down and tells them: "there is bound to come a time in this company when you will hit a sudden economic crisis. when these times come you must know how to cut down on expenses and do the best you can with what budget you have. " he then proceeds to give them each 1000 dollars, and tells them that he will come back to the mine in a week, and see which of them have been able to move the most ore with the money they were given.  he returns after one week to check up on them, and approaches his oldest son."how much digging have you been able to do?" he asks.   "three tons of ore, father. i used 300 dollars to buy a broken digger, then used my business contacts to find a mechanic willing to fix it for just 200 dollars if i gave his 5 kids a job. the youth is so desperate for a job this day that they will do 12-hour shifts even for an internship, and i only had to pay them 100 dollars each for a week of work."  the father pats his son proudly on the shoulder before moving on to his middle child, asking him how much mining he had been able to do as well.  "ten tons of ore, father. i used 100 dollars to run a local ad in the newspaper asking for workers, then took in 75 undocumented immigrants who all brought their own tools and shovels. they're all so afraid of being taken by immigration that they're willing to work for half minimum wage."  the father looks skeptically at his son for a while but notices the massive piles of ore the workers are carrying out and gives him a nod before carrying on to his youngest son.  "how much mining have you been able to do?" asks the father.  "thirty-five tons, dad, but i didn't use any of the money you gave me."the father looks at him in awe, his jawdropping. how were you able to move 35 tons of ore for free!?"  "i invited a bunch of conspiracy theorists. they just keep digging deeper and deeper thinking they're going to find something, and every time i tell them to take a break they accuse me of trying to withhold the truth from them!"	3

once upon a time there was a international poets contest. all the poets from across the lands came to compete bringing there best original work to compete against their peers. for 40 days and nights they competed eliminating poet after poet. on the 40th day they had narrowed it down to only 2 poets. both poets read poems back to back for 12 hours, each poem as good as the last. after the 12th hour the judge’s became exhausted and realized that this may never end as both poets were equally amazing. they had to decide a winner and they had to decide it now. so they called a recess and went to a separate room to come up with a way of figuring this out. after a hour they came back and called in the poets. the head judge addressed them proclaiming “both of you are the creme of the crop, the top of your game and we cannot decide who is better so we have come up with a single elimination spontaneous poem based on a random subject that neither one of you have ever mentioned in all of your work. you will have exactly 1 minute to prepare your poem and after both contestants have read their work we will decide. the subject is timbuktu!”  both poets immediately started to contemplate their upcoming feat and after 30 seconds the first poet stepped forward. “esteemed judges, i am ready.” he cleared his throat, “timbuktu by robert frost of london england.....ye as i walk across this foreign land, i feel my feet upon the sand, i see a train coming thru, on its way to timbuktu” the judges looked at eachother with agreement that this was a poet at his prime. they thanked him and mr frost stepped back. the next poet stepped up with a grin and addressed the judges. “my poem is ready sirs and madams, timbuktu by ollie johnson of ballard washington.....tim and i a hunting we went, when we spotted three maidens in a tent, well they was three and we was two, so i bucked one and tim bucked two.	1

"you know, all this time i thought you were married... a lot of your mail is addressed "mr. and mrs. johnson"  "i *am* married"  she replies.   the mailman goes pale...."won"t your husband be upset?"  "don't be silly," she replies.  "he suggested it!"  "really?!"  says the astonished mailman.   "yup!  i told him it was your last day, and i wanted to do something special for you.   he said 'fuck him, give him a dollar!"  "but breakfast was *my* idea!"	2

box under the bed when eamonn and ruth first got married eamonn said, *“i am a sex addict and i’m putting a box under the bed to help control my addiction. you must promise never to look in it.”*  in all their 30 years of marriage, ruth never looked. however, on the afternoon of their 30th anniversary, curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. in the box were 3 empty beer cans and £81,874.25 in cash. she closed the box and put it back under the bed. now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why there even was such a box with such contents.  that evening they were out for a special anniversary dinner. after dinner, ruth could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, *“i am so sorry. for all these years i kept my promise and never looked into the box under our bed. however, today the temptation was too much and i gave in. but now i need to know why do you keep the 3 beer cans in the box?”* …  eamonn thought for a while and said, *“i guess after all these years you deserve to know the truth. whenever i was unfaithful to you i put an empty beer can in the box under the bed to remind myself not to do it again.”*  ruth was shocked, but said, *“hmmm,  fiona phillips, penny smith and holly willoughby. i am very disappointed and saddened by your behaviour. however, since you are addicted to sex, i guess it does happen and i guess 3 times is not that bad considering your problem.”*  eamonn thanked her for being so understanding. they hugged and made their peace.  a little while later ruth asked *"eamonn, so why do you have all that money in the box?"*  eamonn answered; *“well, whenever the box filled up with empty cans, i took them to the recycling centre and redeemed them for cash”*	3

the outdoor toilet a young man wanted to invite his girlfriend to their farm but was embarrassed by the old-fashioned outdoor toilet.   he kept bickering his dad for a modern, indoor one, but the old-timer didn't want to give in.   out of sheer desperation, he slips out one night, puts a lot of dynamite behind the toilet and blows the whole affair into oblivion.   the next morning at breakfast, his father asks him if it was he who destroyed the toilet and at the same time reminds him of the story of george washington and the cherry tree.   "yes, dad," sighed the boy. "it was me."   "i'm glad you're so honest." said his father.   "and as punishment, you have to start digging the pit for a new one immediately."  "but dad," protests the boy, "when george washington admitted it was he who cut the tree, his father didn't punish him!"   "yes, you're right," said his father. "but george's dad wasn't in the cherry tree when he cut it down!"	3

"here's a stunning ring at only $40,000", the jeweler said.  the young lady's eyes sparkled and her whole body trembled with excitement.  the old man seeing this said, "we'll take it."  the jeweler asked how payment would be made and the old man stated, by cheque. "i know you need to make sure my cheque is good, so i'll write it now and you can call the bank monday to verify the funds and i'll pick the ring up monday afternoon," he said.  monday morning, a very teed-off jeweler phoned the old man. "there's no money in that account."  "i know", said the old man, "but can you imagine the weekend i had?"	3

after trying many fruits and vegetables in my kids lunch, their favourite by far was sliced cucumber. i don’t know if it was our source, or our fridge, but they only really stayed fresh for a few days. this meant that at least twice a week i was stopping at the corner grocery store to just grab a couple cucumbers.  after a couple months it became obvious that i kept buying them from the same clerk. the way he interacted with me also changed, giving me little smile’s and sometimes a wink.  all of a sudden it hit me, and i felt embarrassed by what he was probably thinking. the next time i went in i also grabbed a jar of vaseline; hopefully i fixed this before he spread any rumours about me being a vegan.	3

"watch this!". he holds his fishing pole across the river....and the water parts!    moses hops down onto the riverbed, and struts toward the far bank. once there, he plucks out a blade of grass, and tucks it in his cheek, before sauntering back to where jesus waits. he climbs up on the bank, turns back toward the river, make a gesture with his hands, and the water comes back together.    jesus says, "mo, that was pretty impressive...but i'll have you know as a younger man i used to *walk* on water."    moses smiles, and makes a sweeping gesture towards the river.    jesus walks to the edge, looks at the water, and it flattens out like a sheet of glass. he hops down onto the surface and begins to stride across the river.    he gets about ¼ of the way across, and the water is up over his ankles. he gets ½ way across, and the water is approaching his knees. jesus realizes that he's not going to make it to the far bank and back, so he turns around, and hustles back to where he started.    by the time he gets there, the water is waist-high. moses hauls him out of the river, laughing.    jesus scowls, wringing out his robe, and says, "give me a break, man. that's before i had these damn holes in my feet."	3

three men are lost in the desert with no supplies, when the devil appears before them. the devil looks at their skin and bones, their cracked lips, and says, “i see you’re in a bit of a rough spot. i can help you - let’s play a little game. you each get one chance to name a task i can’t do. if you succeed, i’ll save you.”  the first man immediately replies, “i bet you can’t build a highway that goes around the entire world!” the devil snaps his fingers, and instantly, a road appears that circles the globe. the first man expires on the spot from a mixture of thirst and despair.  the second man, looking at the corpse of his friend, thinks for a minute. he thinks of his job, his family, his friends, and the life he has to return to.   after spending some time drawing figures in the sand and doing some calculations, he hesitantly says, “there’s no possible way you can build a ladder that reaches space.” but the devil simply smirks and taps his pitchfork on the ground, and at once, a ladder to the stars appears. the second man perishes where he stands, muttering the name of his wife and children until his last breath.  the third and final man calmly looks at the bodies of his companions and sits down in the sand to brainstorm. he thinks of the time his spouse first kissed him, the moment he first saw his son, and the last words of his late father telling him how proud he was of him.   having made up his mind, he quietly tells the devil, “first make a chair.” puzzled, the devil creates a simple wooden chair.   “next, poke 20 holes in it about an inch in diameter.” the devil follows these instructions. the man suddenly pulls down his pants, sits on the chair, and passes a loud fart.   as the devil looks on in amazement, the man stands up and asks “which hole did i fart through?”   so the devil points to the hole three rows down, in the second column. “that one.” and sure enough, it is.  but the man smiles and bends over, pointing to his rear, and replies, “wrong - i farted through this hole.”	2

a rich, but miserly father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 17 y/o daughter. he wanted the party to be extravagant but wanted to spend as little money as possible. he had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.  "why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  so the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  "my daughter is inviting all of her friends, and i'll look bad if i don't put together a good cake", he thought. then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide a free cake to its customers.  "how quaint", the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  he was met by a buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "hello," the father asked, "i would like to buy a cake."  "of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  the father thought this to be weird, but want to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  the day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. all of the guests were in awe and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  the monk became the guest of honour and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "why do you do this for free? you should take money for your services!"  the monk smiled and said, "i do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."	3

a woman walks into a pet store. after her two daughters moved out some months ago, she thought of having a pet around the house.   as she looks around the store, she finds a parrot sitting on a perch. attached to the perch is a sign that says: "special offer! talking parrot, only 10$".   wondering about the low price she asks the cashier about it.   the cashier replies: "the parrot once lived in a brothel until police busted it. it was some kind of entertainment at the bar as it knows some crude language."   after short thinking the woman says: "i take the parrot. i'm sure i can break it of this behavior."  the woman arrives at home and puts the parrot in the living room. the parrot takes a look around, beats it's wings and squawks: "woohoo, nice! finally a new whorehouse and a new madam!"  the woman is slightly irritated at first but then laughs it off.   shortly after, the two daughters come for a visit. before the woman can tell the daughters about the parrot, it spots them and squawks: "nice, new whorehouse, new madam and new hookers! c'mon girls, let the fun begin!"  the daughters are also irritated, but let it go as the woman explains the background. the parrot continues with some crude remarks every so often until the woman's husband comes home. the parrot looks at him top-down and squawks: "hi, john, long time no see!"	2

once upon a time, in the magical fantasy kingdom, there lived a young monk named sam. his order was renowned for their beautiful choral singing. they trained, hours every day, refining their voices and their art. their song floated down the mountainside, enriching the lives and souls of the townspeople below.  sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully intricate note of pure magic. everyone within miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone. and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was sam, and sam was the first person in history to hit one of the rumored magical notes that musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one before sam had ever reached one.  and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again. this time, the town below was so impacted that no one moved, spoke, or even blinked for several minutes after. as the golden sound finally tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had found the second note... and the next year on sam's birthday, the town had realized there was a pattern involved. this time, all of the townspeople were present in the monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit the glorious third note. people cried out in pure joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo. words cannot do justice to the experience. the town flourished, as sam's notes made the people pure all the way to the core of their beings. and on it went for the next few years, the magical notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that is, sam's 25th birthday. all at first seemed as normal... until sam hit the magical note. from the start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and discordant. sam started to get very warm, and was visibly sweating onstage. he doubled his resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part of the magical note that he knew must be there. suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously combusted! the two closest monks on stage were burned by the flames coming off of his body, and he ignited the stage curtains. soon the entire monastery was aflame. by a miracle, everyone made it out, except for poor sam.  the townsfolk were left staring at the burning monastery in sad, stunned disbelief. the mayor approached the lead monk of the order. "what happened?" he asked, exasperated. the old monk shook his head sadly. "isn't it obvious?"   he said. "sam sung note 7."	2

"i want to pull your pants down, spread yoghurt between the cheeks of your arse and lick it all off" comes the reply. "you dirty filthy pervert. you're banned! get out!" she storms. again the man apologies and swears never ever to do it again. "one more chance" says the barmaid.  "now what do you want?" she asks as the man returns. "i want to turn you upside down, fill your cunt with guinness, and then drink every last drop". the barmaid is furious at this personal intrusion, and runs upstairs to fetch her husband, who's sitting quietly watching the telly. "what's up, love?" he asks.  "there's a man in the bar who wants to put his head between my breasts and lick the sweat off" she says. "i'll kill him! where is he?" storms the husband. "then he said he wanted to pour yoghurt down between my arse cheeks and lick it off" she screams. "right, he's dead!" says the husband, reaching for a baseball bat. "then he said he wanted to turn me upside down, fill my cunt with guinness and then drink it all..." she cries. the husband stops, puts down his bat and then returns to his armchair and switches the telly back on.  "aren't you going to do something about it?" she cries hysterically. "look love... i'm not messing with someone who can drink 12 pints of guinness."	3

the golfing nun - and why life is never perfect.  a nun walks into mother superior's office and plunks down into a chair. she lets out a sigh heavy with frustration.      'what troubles you, sister?' asked the mother superior. 'i thought this was the day you spent with your family.'      'it was,' sighed the sister. 'and i went to play golf with my brother. we try to play golf as often as we can. you know i was quite a talented golfer before i devoted my life to christ.'      'i seem to recall that,' the mother superior agreed. 'so i take it your day of recreation was not relaxing?'      'far from it,' snorted the sister. 'in fact, i even took the lord's name in vain today!'      'goodness, sister!' gasped the mother superior, astonished. 'you must tell me all about it!'      'well, we were on the fifth tee...and this hole is a monster, mother -540 yard par 5, with a nasty dogleg left and a hidden green...and i hit the drive of my life. i creamed it. the sweetest swing i ever made.      and it's flying straight and true, right along the line i wanted...and it hits a bird in mid-flight!'      ‘oh, my goodness’ said the mother. 'how unfortunate! but surely that didn't make you blaspheme, sister!'      'no, that wasn't it,' admitted sister. 'while i was still trying to fathom what had happened, this squirrel runs out of the woods, grabs my ball and runs off down the fairway!'      ‘that would have made me blaspheme!' sympathized the mother.      'but i didn't, mother!' sobbed the sister. 'and i was so proud of myself!      and while i was pondering whether this was a sign from god, this hawk swoops out of the sky and grabs the squirrel and flies off, with my ball still clutched in his paws!'      'so that's when you cursed,' said the mother with a knowing smile.      'nope, that wasn't it either,' cried the sister, anguished, 'because as the hawk started to fly out of sight, the squirrel started struggling, and the hawk dropped him right there on the green, and the ball popped out of his paws and rolled to about 18 inches from the cup!'      mother superior sat back in her chair, folded her arms across her chest, fixed the sister with a baleful stare and said..............      'you missed the fucking putt, didn't you?'   \\[while i've never seen this joke here, it's probably been posted a 100 times. i don't care - i still love it and wanted to share it.\\]	3

the coach grimaced as he watched his young ice hockey team. at one point during the game, he called one of his 7-year-old players aside and asked, "do you understand what cooperation is? what a team is?" the little boy nodded affirmatively... "do you understand that what matters is not whether we win or lose, but how we play together as a team?"  the little boy nodded once more.  "so..." the coach continued. "i'm sure you know that when a penalty is called, you shouldn't argue, curse, attack the referee, or call him a pecker-head. do you understand all that?"  again the little boy nodded.  he continued, "and when i call you off the ice so that another boy gets a chance to play, it's not good sportsmanship to call your coach a dumb asshole, is it?"  the little boy nodded yet again.  "good." said the coach. "now go over there and explain all that to your mother."	3

once lived a man with his mother, who dreamt of buying a car everyday. but those were hard times. money was scarce. jobs weren't easy to get. so, he applied to work as a worker in a dairy factory, coz who doesn't want to have milk, but soon realised with his monthly wages, it'll take him 10 years to save enough money for the car.  next, he applied in a newspaper company thinking that people would surely read newspapers even during the hard times. apparently, they do, but still it'll take him about 5 years to save enough money for the car. so he quit.  next day, as the man was sitting idle, jobless on his porch, a seemingly modern person with clothes quite ahead of his time came up to him and took out a rectangular piece of enlightened metal. our man was quite astonished with what he saw, but now he knew what to do.  so the next day, he started to chop down every fence post in the neighborhood. next, he had them replaced with new, fresh wooden fences. but since nobody could figure out the motive of his purpose, he was reported to the police and arrested.  some days later, his mother came to visit him in the prison. she sobbed and sobbed, and asked him at last, 'why did you do it, son?'  'because reposting is the fastest way to get car, ma.'	3

an american, a german and a chinese got arrested consuming alcohol which is a severe offence in saudi arabia so for the terrible crime, they were all sentenced 20 lashes each of the whip.  as they were preparing for their punishment, the sheik announced: "it's my first wife's birthday today, and she has asked me to allow each of you one wish before your whipping .."  the german was first in line, he thought for a while and then said: " please tie a pillow to my back .."  this was done, but the pillow only lasted 10 lashes & the german had to be carried away bleeding and crying with pain.  the chinese was next up. after watching the german in horror he said smugly: " please fix two pillows to my back."  but even two pillows could only take 15 lashes & the chinese was also led away whimpering loudly.  the american was the last one up, but before he could say anything, the sheik turned to him and said: " i like you americans. for this, you may have two wishes !"  " thank you, your most royal and merciful highness," american replied.  " in recognition of your kindness, my first wish is that you give me not 20, but 100 lashes."  " not only are you an honourable, handsome and powerful man, you are also very brave. " the sheik said with an admiring look on his face.  " if 100 lashes is what you desire, then so be it.  " and what is your second wish? " the sheik asked.  american smiled and said, " tie the chinese to my back!!! "	1

a man was taking a train to the city from a rural town, when he saw the most beautiful blonde he'd ever laid his eyes on upon close inspection, it seemed that the woman was a country bumpkin; and that he overheard her say to an attendant that it was her first time riding a train, and going to a big city.   because his lust was too strong, he was determined to take advantage of her and waited for an opportunity to do so.   surely enough, after they arrived at the station, he saw the lady frantically moving as if she's looking for something or someone.   under the guise of a gentleman's persona, the man approached her. "what seems to be the problem, miss?" he asked her   "oh oh! i don't mean to bother you, but it's my first time in the city; and i'm looking for my relatives -- they promised to pick me up. would you be able to help me, sir?" she replied with a concerned tone   bad intensions overcame the man; he nodded and then led the lady to the comfort rooms. upon making sure that there's no one else around; the man took the woman to a stall, sat her down, and pulled his pants down to reveal his erected penis.   "do you know what to do with this?" the man said to her  "of course," she replied as she grabbed his dick.  the man turned red, he could not believe his luck!    suddenly, she twisted the shaft and jammed her fingers on his balls. and with a booming voice, she proclaimed "hello hello, can anyone hear me? i'm lost, and i'm looking for my family!"	3

a wealthy, but stingy father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 16 y/o daughter.  he wanted the party to be extravagant but wanted to spend as little money as possible. he had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.  "why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  so the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *"*my daughter is inviting all of her friends, and i'll look bad if i don't put together a good cake*"*, he thought. then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide a free cake to its customers.  "how quaint*",* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  he was met by a buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "hello," the father asked, "i would like to buy a cake."  "of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  the father thought this to be weird, but want to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  the day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. all of the guests were in awe and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  the monk became the guest of honour and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "why do you do this for free? you should take money for your services!"  the monk smiled and said, "i do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."	3

a horse and a chicken were walking down a country road when they saw some corn in a ditch just across the road.  the horse walked over to eat the corn.  before he got to the corn, he became stuck in the mud. for all his trying he could not get out of the mud.  so he tells the chicken "hey, go over to that farm house and get some help to get me out of this mud.”  when the chicken gets to the farm house, he can't find anybody to help him get the horse out of the mud. however, he notices that there is a mercedes parked in the driveway and the keys are in the ignition.  the chicken drives the mercedes back down the road, ties a rope he found to the mercedes and throws the other end to the horse.  in a jiffy the horse is out of the mud.  the two proceed down the road again when they see some more corn on the side of the road.  this time the chicken crosses over a ditch to get the corn.  and as luck would have it, the chicken gets stuck in the mud. the chicken tells the horse "hey, go get that mercedes and pull me out of this mud.”  the horse surveys the problem and says "i think i can straddle this ditch because it is not too big and, when i do, just grab my dick and i'll pull you out of the mud.”  the horse does as he says and the chicken is pulled out of the mud.  turns out that when you're hung like a horse, you don't need a mercedes to pick up chicks.	3

politically correct santa politically correct santa  'twas the night before christmas and santa's a wreck... how to live in a world that's politically correct?  his workers no longer would answer to "elves," "vertically challenged" they were calling themselves.  and labour conditions at the north pole were alleged by the union to stifle the soul.  four reindeer had vanished, without much propriety, released to the wilds by the humane society.  and equal employment had made it quite clear that santa had better not use just reindeer.  so dancer and donner, comet and cupid, were replaced with 4 pigs, and you know that looked stupid!  the runners had been removed from his sleigh; the ruts were termed dangerous by the e.p.a.  and people had started to call for the cops when they heard sled noises on their roof-tops.  second-hand smoke from his pipe had his workers quite frightened. his fur-trimmed red suit was called "unenlightened."  and to show you the strangeness of life's ebbs and flows, rudolf was suing over unauthorized use of his nose  and had gone on geraldo, in front of the nation, demanding millions in over-due compensation.  so, half of the reindeer were gone; and his wife, who suddenly said she'd enough of this life,  joined a self-help group, packed, and left in a whiz, demanding from now on her title was ms.  and as for the gifts, why, he'd ne'er had a notion that making a choice could cause so much commotion.  nothing of leather, nothing of fur, which meant nothing for him. and nothing for her.  nothing that might be construed to pollute. nothing to aim. nothing to shoot.  nothing that clamoured or made lots of noise. nothing for just girls. or just for the boys.  nothing that claimed to be gender specific. nothing that's warlike or non-pacific.  no candy or sweets...they were bad for the tooth. nothing that seemed to embellish a truth.  and fairy tales, while not yet forbidden, were like ken and barbie, better off hidden.  for they raised the hackles of those psychological who claimed the only good gift was one ecological.  no baseball, no football...someone could get hurt; besides, playing sports exposed kids to dirt.  dolls were said to be sexist, and should be passe; and nintendo would rot your entire brain away.  so santa just stood there, dishevelled, perplexed; he just could not figure out what to do next.  he tried to be merry, tried to be gay, but you've got to be careful with that word today.  his sack was quite empty, limp to the ground; nothing fully acceptable was to be found.  something special was needed, a gift that he might give to all without angering the left or the right.  a gift that would satisfy, with no indecision, each group of people, every religion;  every ethnicity, every hue, everyone, everywhere...even you.  so here is that gift, its price beyond worth... "may you and your loved ones enjoy peace on earth."  (c) harvey ehrlich, 1992	2

a construction crew started building a new house down the street. my daughter was excited to see the big construction vehicles, so i let her go check it out (with me watching of course). the crew loved that a young person was interested in construction, so let her sit and watch them work.  sometimes they would sit her in the trucks and show her how it operates, even gave her a few odd jobs here and there, made her feel like part of the team.  the crew boss even noticed, and after a week, they gave her a pay envelope of ten dollars.  i thought this was so great, and the crew was so nice, so i took my daughter down to the bank to open a savings account, teaching her about the work force, how pay works, what a bank does, and the importance of money.  i told the teller at the bank the whole story about the construction crew, her interest in working, and that i’m teaching her the value of the dollar. the teller smiles at my daughter and goes,  “this is such an important lesson for life, and i’m so glad that you’re learning this now. tell me...would you go back next week and work with those guys?”  my daughter sits back in her chair and says,  “we will, if those fucking assholes can finally deliver that goddamn sheetrock!”	2

a frenchman, an englishman and an australian were hiking through some remote mountains. the weather was oppressively hot when they saw this beautiful lake. they ran down to the lake, stripped off and swam in the wonderfully cool water.  natives appeared on the shore and captured them and took them before the chief.  "lake is our most sacred site. you have violated sacred site and must die. when you dead, we skin you and use skin to make canoe. place canoe on lake to remind visitors not to infringe on sacred site. you have one last wish before you die."  the frenchman says, "i would like a knife."  he receives the knife and calls out, "i would rather kill myself than die at the hands of you savages!" he then quickly slashes his throat and dies.  the englishman says, "i too would like a knife." when he receives the knife, he calls out, "like my friend from across the channel, i too would rather kill myself than die at the hands of you savages! god save the queen!" he also slashes his throat and dies.  "what about you?", they ask the aussie.  " i want a fork".  they hand him the fork and he jabs it into himself all over his torso.  "there goes your fucking canoe!"  &#x200b;  *(thanks to the late ex-prime minister of australia, bob hawke)*	3

a single guy decided life would be more fun if he had a pet.  so he went to the pet store and told the owner that he wanted to buy an unusual pet. after some discussion, he finally bought a talking centipede, which came in a little white box to use as his house. he took the box back home, and decided he would start off by taking his new pet to church with him. so he knocked on the box and asked the centipede, "would you like to go to church with me today? we will have a good time." but there was no answer from his new pet. this bothered him a bit, but he waited a few minutes and then asked again, "how about going to church with me and receiving blessings?" but again, there was no answer from his new friend and pet. so he waited a few minutes more, thinking about the situation. finally, the guy decided to give the centipede one last chance. this time he put his face right up against his pet's house and shouted, "hey, in there! would you like to go to church with me and learn about god?" this time, a rather annoyed little voice came out of the box,  "i heard you the first time! i'm putting my shoes on."	2

joe wanted to buy a motorbike he didn't have much luck until, one day, he comes across a harley with a “for sale” sign on it.  the bike seems even better than a new one, although it is 10 years old. it is shiny and in absolute perfect condition. he immediately buys it, and asks the seller how he kept it in such great condition for 10 years. “well, it’s quite simple, really,” says the seller, “whenever the bike is outside and it’s going to rain, rub vaseline on the chrome. it protects it from the rain.” saying so, he hands joe a jar of vaseline.  that night, his girlfriend, sandra, invites him over to meet her parents. naturally, they take the bike there. just before they enter the house, sandra stops him and says, “i have to tell you something about my family before we go in. when we eat dinner, we don’t talk. in fact, the first person who says anything during dinner has to do the dishes.”  “no problem,” he says. and in they go. joe is shocked. right smack in the middle of the living room is a huge stack of dirty dishes. in the kitchen is another huge stack of dishes. piled up on the stairs, in the corridor, everywhere he looks, dirty dishes. they sit down to dinner and, sure enough, no one says a word.  as dinner progresses, joe decides to take advantage of the situation and leans over and kisses sandra. no one says a word. so he reaches over and fondles her breasts. still, nobody says a word. so he stands up, grabs her, rips her clothes off, throws her on the table, and fucks her right there, in front of her parents. his girlfriend is a little flustered, her dad is obviously livid, and her mom horrified when he sits back down, but no one says a word.  he looks at her mom. “she’s got a great body,” he thinks. so he grabs the mom, bends her over the dinner table, and has his way with her in every position right there on the dinner table. now his girlfriend is furious and her dad is boiling, but still, total silence.  all of a sudden there is a loud clap of thunder and it starts to rain. joe remembers his bike, so he pulls the jar of vaseline from his pocket. suddenly the father backs away from the table and shouts, “all right, that’s enough, i’ll do the fucking dishes.”	2

a tale of two letters stalin, knowing that his time was short and that khrushchev would be  his eventual successor, summoned nikita to a very private meeting. after telling khrushchev how lonely it could get at the top, stalin said:  "i've left for you two letters containing my wisest counsel in the  bottom drawer of the desk. do not open the first one until things are totally terrible. the second letter should only be opened when you are  sure there are no answers to your problems, when you are despairing."  &#x200b;  khrushchev took over and enjoyed a russian honeymoon. then trouble followed: a failed harvest, the five-year plan was two years late and many rubles  short, plotting by his political enemies...  at 3 a.m. one morning,  khrushchev broke down and opened the bottom desk drawer and read the  first letter. in it was written one line:   "blame everything on me . . . stalin."  &#x200b;  so that's  what khrushchev did and all the  troubles of the present were pinned on the policies of his predecessor.  it worked, and the pressure was off, for awhile.  the second  honeymoon was brief. hostilities along the chinese border, another lousy crop and the humiliating cuban missile crisis did very little for khrushchev's ratings and even less for his own peace of mind. he was down when he remembered the bottom desk drawer. making certain he was  alone, khrushchev quietly opened the envelope and read the one-line message:  "write two letters . . . stalin."	1

the southern grandma -lawyers should never ask a mississippi grandma a question if they aren't prepared for the answer.  in a trial, a southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. he approached her and asked, 'mrs. jones, do you know me?' she responded, 'why, yes, i do know you, mr. williams. i've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. you lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. you think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. yes, i know you.'  the lawyer was stunned. not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'mrs. jones, do you know the defense attorney?'  she again replied, 'why yes, i do. i've known mr. bradley since he was a  youngster, too. he's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. he can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. one of them was your wife. yes, i know him.'  the defense attorney nearly died.  the judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,   'if either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, i'll send you both to the electric chair.'	2

the priest & the frog... "one fine sunny morning, the irish priest took a walk in the local forest. he had been walking by the small stream when he noticed a sad, sad looking frog sitting on a toadstool."  "what's wrong with you?" said the irish priest."  "well," said the frog, "the reason i am so sad on this fine day is because i wasn't always a frog."  "really!" said the irish priest. "please explain!"  "well, once upon a time i was a 12 year old choir boy at the local church. i too was walking through this forest when i was confronted by the local wicked witch. 'let me pass!' i yelled, but to no avail. she called me a cheeky little boy and with a flash of her wand, she turned me into this frog you see before you."  "that's an incredible story." said the irish priest. "is there no way of reversing this spell that the witch has cast upon you?."  "yes" said the frog, "it is said, that if a nice kind person would pick me up, take me home, give me food & warmth and with a good nights sleep i would wake up a boy once again."  "today's your lucky day!" said the irish priest, and picked up the frog and took him home. the irish priest gave the frog lots of food, placed him by the fire and at bedtime put the frog on the pillow beside him. when the irish priest awoke, he saw the 12-year-old boy beside him in bed,  and that your honor is the case for the defense.......	3

squirrels have faith   the presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation. after much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they should not interfere with god’s divine will.   at the baptist church, the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistry. the deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistry and let the squirrels drown themselves. the squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.   the lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of god’s creatures. so, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the baptist church. two weeks later, the squirrels were back when the baptists took down the water-slide.   the episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning. they sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do.   but the catholic church came up with a more creative strategy! they baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church. now they only see them at christmas and easter.   not much was heard from the jewish synagogue. they took the first squirrel and circumcised him. they haven’t seen a squirrel since.	3

a boy sees a beautiful girl across the street. after they hit it off, he goes home and excitedly tells his dad the news.  “dad, i just got to know this amazing girl across the street! she lives really close by and her name is jenna. i really like her!”  the father winces and looks at him. “son, i’m sorry to tell you this, but jenna is actually your sister. i had a fling with the neighbor before i began to date your mother.”  dejected, the son leaves the room and cuts off all communication with her.  a month goes by and the son meets another girl,  named valerie. they flirt with each other, find out she lives down the street, and the son goes back home and tells his father.  the father winces again. “sorry son, but valerie is actually your sister as well.”  in the middle of his explanation, the son storms out of the room and leaves the house to take a breather, while cutting off all communication with valerie.  three months later, the son meets the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen, prettier than the last two girls combined. he finds out her name is brooke, and rushes home after exchanging numbers, leaving little time to actually talk to her.  the son busts into his father’s room.   “dad, i met this girl named brooke, and she lives a few streets away. before i tell you about her, is she your daughter too?”  a moment goes by and the son begins to hope that this girl is finally the one.  and then the father winces.  the son leaves the room and goes to sit in the living room to cool his head after finding out three girls he’s had feelings for are actually his sisters.  after a few hours, his mother sits down next to him.  “honey, what’s wrong? you’ve been very sad as of late.”  in tears, the son turns to his mother. “i’m upset because i met three amazing girls who all seemed interested in me these past few months, and every single time, dad’s told me that they’re actually my sisters!”  the mother looks bewildered and begins to laugh.  “mom, why are you laughing?”  “oh honey, don’t worry about a thing. date any of those girls!”  the son makes a face of disgust and disbelief. “why would i date any of my father’s daughters?”  the mother smiles.  “because he isn’t actually your father.”	3

the navajo man and nasa when nasa was preparing for the apollo project, it took the astronauts to the arizona desert for training.  one day, a navajo elder and his son came across the space crew walking among the rocks. the elder, who spoke only navajo, asked a question. his son translated for the nasa people: "what are these guys in the big suits doing?"  one of the astronauts said that they were practicing for a trip to the moon. when his son relayed this comment the navajo elder got all excited and asked if it would be possible to give to the astronauts a message to deliver to the moon.  recognizing a promotional opportunity when he saw one, a nasa official accompanying the astronauts said, "why certainly!" and told an underling to get a tape recorder. the navajo elder's comments into the microphone were brief.  the nasa official asked the son if he would translate what his father had said. the son listened to the recording and laughed uproariously. but he refused to translate. so the nasa people took the tape to a nearby navajo village and played it for other members of the tribe. they too laughed long and loudly but also refused to translate the elder's message to the moon.  finally, an official government translator was summoned. after he finally stopped laughing the translator relayed the message: "watch out for these guys - they have come to steal your land."	3

a woman visits a florist to get some flowers for her mother. as she's perusing, she notices the most gorgeous rose she's ever seen sitting next to the cashier, and inquires about it.   "oh, sorry," the cashier replies. "that one's not for sale. you see, i got that as a gift from a fellow florist for hooking him up with a woman i met yesterday."  "yesterday?!" she gasps. "how did they hit it off so quickly?"  "well, he's a great listener, for one. he's a super sweet guy, and to top it off, he's got a 10 inch cock."  she blushes. "sounds like a catch to me! where can i find him?"  "he's just a block over, but he's also a little kooky. see, he only has sex with women named after flowers, so if i meet someone like that, i send them his way. then, he sends me the flower as a thank you. yesterday was rose, and a week ago, i recommended a woman named violet to him," he said, indicating a slightly wilted violet in a vase behind him.   the woman thanks him for the info and leaves the shop, a little bitter about her own name. but she visits the well-endowed florist anyway. she steps up to the counter and pointedly says, "i heard you're particularly...*skilled*...in certain areas?"  he smirks. "what is your name?"   she pouts a little and says "kris." his smile falters, and he sighs and shakes his head.  kris's heart drops. "well...then i'd like some flowers for my mother."  suddenly, he brightens up again. "i think we can make this work." he takes her hand and locks the shop door.   three hours of mind-altering sex later, she stumbles to the shop door and bids him goodbye with a kiss. "and please," he says, "tell your mother she is welcome to as many flowers from my shop as she would like." taken aback, she promises to convey the message, and calls her mother that night to tell her everything.   the next day, kris feels like a million bucks and swings by the original florist's shop.  "i just wanted to thank you for telling me about that gentleman! he was amazing!"  he smiles sheepishly.

a man was speeding, when a cop noticed him. the man saw the cop and tried going faster. the cops chased him, he sped up even more, the cop stayed on him.    the man finally got his car going as fast as his car would go and the cop still stayed on his tail, so he pulled over.    the cop walks up to his and tells the guy, "you'd better damn well have a good excuse for going that fast and trying to evade me or i am hauling you off and having your car towed."    the man says, "well my recently divorced wife left me for a cop and i thought you were him trying to return her."    the cop says, "sorry about the wife, just keep your speed down." and walks away.	1

and then the fight started . . . my wife sat down on the couch next to me as i was flipping channels.  she asked, 'what's on tv?'  i said, 'dust.'     and then the fight started...   ----------  my wife and i are watching "who wants to be a millionaire" while we were in bed.  i turned to her and said, "do you want to have sex?"  "no," she answered.  i then said, "is that your final answer?"  she didn't even look at me this time, simply saying, "yes."  so i said, "then i'd like to phone a friend."  and then the fight started...  ----------  saturday morning i got up early, quietly dressed, made my lunch, grabbed the dog, and slipped quietly into the garage. i hooked up the boat up to the truck, and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour. the wind was blowing 50 mph, so i pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad all day.  i went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. i cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a different anticipation, and whispered, "the weather out there is terrible."  my loving wife of 10 years replied, "can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that?"  and then the fight started...  ----------  i rear-ended a car this morning. so, there we were alongside the road and slowly the other driver got out of his car. you know how sometimes you just get soooo stressed and little things just seem funny? yeah, well i couldn't believe it.... he was a dwarf!!!  he stormed over to my car, looked up at me, and shouted, "i am not happy !!!"  so, i looked down at him and said, "well, then which one are you?"  and then the fight started...  ----------  my wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary.  she said, 'i want something shiny that goes from 0 to 150 in about 3 seconds.'  i bought her a bathroom scale.  and then the fight started...   ----------  when i got home last night, my wife demanded that i take her someplace expensive.  so, i took her to a gas station.  and then the fight started...   ----------  after retiring, i went to the social security office to apply for social security. the woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's license to verify my age. i looked in my pockets and realized i had left my wallet at home. i told the woman that i was very sorry, but i would have to go home and come back later.  the woman said, 'unbutton your shirt'. so i opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair. she said, 'that silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my social security application.  when i got home, i excitedly told my wife about my experience at the social security office.   she said, 'you should have dropped your pants. you might have gotten disability, too.'   and then the fight started...  ----------  my wife and i were sitting at a table at my high school reunion, and i kept staring at a drunken lady swigging her drink as she sat alone at a nearby table.   my wife asked, 'do you know her?'   'yes,' i sighed, 'she's my old girlfriend. i understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and i hear she hasn't been sober since.'   'my god!' says my wife, 'who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?'   and then the fight started...  ----------  i took my wife to a restaurant. the waiter, for some reason, took my order first.     "i'll have the strip steak, medium rare, please."  he said, "aren't you worried about the mad cow?"  "nah, she can order for herself."   and then the fight started...   ----------  a woman is standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror.  she is not happy with what she sees and says to her husband, 'i feel horrible; i look old, fat and ugly.  i really need you to pay me a compliment.'   the husband replies, 'your eyesight's damn near perfect.'   and then the fight started...	3

a newbee hunter asked a experienced old hunter how to hunt bears the old man answered:" it is easy, my son. i've hunted hundreds of bears in my life. you just need to grab your gun and take a ride to some mountains nearby. firsrt, find a cave or stone cavern that might shelter a bear. second, make some 'woo! woo!' sound so that the bear inside would mistake it as a signal of its companion. it would also produce that same sound as a feedback. after it comes out, you just pull the trigger. easy? " the newbee nodded and exited without coming back for months. after a long time, the old hunter saw that newbee on a street and found him crippled, with an ear lost and an eye blind. he asked him what happened. the newbee says:" i did as what you told me before. but god damn it, when something inside that cavern answered my 'woo! woo!', i didn't expect a train would come out and hit me!"  ps: i saw this one days ago and translated it from chinese to english. might be some grammar errors.	3

a sweet old lady is making lunch for her husband one day...  she had been making him the same lunch for the past 40 years. his favorite: a sandwich on italian bread, made with turkey, american cheese, pickles, onions, mustard, and mayo. the husband walks into the kitchen, sits down, and takes a bite. his wife asks the same thing she always asks, “hows the sandwich dear?”     every time he would give the same response, “it tastes fine”. he would continue eating with a disappointed look on his face.     his wife thinks maybe its time to switch things up a bit. so the next day, she makes him his normal lunch, only this time, she makes it with ham and cheese, and on wheat bread. she thought surely he will enjoy this!     the husband enters the kitchen, sits down, and takes a bite. his wife then asks “hows the sandwich dear?”     as always, he replies “it tastes fine”. he would continue eating with a disappointed look on his face.     his wife then thinks maybe she needs to offer him more variety. so the next day, she makes him a sandwich, only this time its made with salami, pepperoni, and extra veggies and vinegarette dressing. he walks in the kitchen, takes a bite, and the wife asks “hows the sandwich dear?”     as always, he replies “it tastes fine” and continued eating with a disappointed look on his face.     the next day, as lunch time is getting ready to roll around, his wife was making him lunch. she was furious at the lack of excitement and enjoyment coming from her husband, so she decides shes going to make him the most unique sandwich hes ever had.     she prepares her italian bread, only this time she toasts it, and almost burns it. she adds random ingredients like peanut butter, peppers and onions, strawberry jam, turkey, ham, corned beef, some olives and some various seasonings. she thought “if this doesnt get a new reaction out of him, nothing will!”     the husband walks into the kitchen, takes a seat, and takes a bite of his sandwich. all of a sudden, his eyes widen, and he takes two more bites.     suddenly, he looks up at his wife with the biggest grin he’s ever had. he chuckled a bit and says “finally! something original in this sub!”	3

one day a man decided to retire... he booked himself on a caribbean cruise and proceeded to have the time of his life, that is, until the ship sank. he soon found himself on an island with no other people, no supplies, nothing, only bananas and coconuts.   after about four months, he is lying on the beach one day when the most gorgeous woman he has ever seen rows up to the shore.   in disbelief, he asks, "where did you come from? how did you get here?"   she replies, "i rowed over from the other side of the island where i landed when my fishing boat sank." "amazing," he notes. "you were really lucky to have a row boat wash up with you."   "oh, this ole thing?" explains the woman. " i made the boat out of some raw material i found on the island. the oars were whittled from gum tree branches. i wove the bottom from palm tree branches, and the sides and stern came from an eucalyptus tree."   "but, where did you get the tools?"   "oh, that was no problem," replied the woman. " on the south side of the island, a very unusual stratum of alluvial rock is exposed. i found that if i fired it to a certain temperature in a volcanic vent i found just down island, it melted into ductile iron and i used that to make tools and used the tools to make the hardware."   the guy is stunned.   "let's row over to my place," she says "and i'll give you a tour." so, after a short time of rowing, she soon docks the boat at a small hand built wharf. as the man looks to shore, he nearly falls off the boat. before him is a long stone walk leading to a cabin and tree house.   while the woman ties up the rowboat with an expertly woven hemp rope, the man can only stare ahead, dumb struck. as they walk into the house, she says casually, it's not much, but i call it home.   please sit down." "would you like a drink?"   "no! no thank you," the man blurts out, still dazed. "i can't take another drop of coconut juice."   "oh, it's not coconut juice," winks the woman. "i have a still. how would you like a jack daniels neat?" trying to hide his continued amazement, the man accepts, and they sit down on her couch to talk. after they exchange their individual survival stories, the woman announces, "i'm going to slip into something more comfortable. would you like to take a shower and shave? there's a razor in the bathroom cabinet upstairs."   no longer questioning anything, the man goes upstairs into the bathroom. there, in the cabinet is a razor made from a piece of tortoise bone. two shells honed to a hollow ground edge are fastened on to its end inside a swivel mechanism.   "this woman is amazing," he muses. "what's next?"   when he returns, she greets him wearing nothing but a bandana around her blonde locks and some small flowers on tiny vines, each strategically positioned. she smelled faintly of coconut oil. she then beckons for him to sit down next to her.   "tell me," she begins suggestively, slithering closer to him, "we've both been out here for many months. you must have been lonely. when was the last time you had a really good ride?"   she stares into his eyes.   he can't believe what he's hearing.  "you mean..." he swallows excitedly as tears start to form in his eyes,   "you've built a motorcycle?”......	3

"open the vault, now!" he screams.  the receptionist opens a giant vault behind her with racks and rows of vials of semen.  "grab a vial" the masked man yells.   the woman, with hands shaking, hands the vial to the robber.  "no. open it up and drink it!" he yells.  "why?" the receptionist asks.  "today is not your day lady, do it now!" he replies.  without hesitation, she tips the vial back and swallows the semen.  "grab 2 more now!!" he yells.  still shaking the woman quickly grabs 2 random vials.  "drink them now!" he yells once again.  "why am i doing this?? please" she asks in despair.  "bitch, i will paint the walls with your fucking  brains if you don't drink those" he says.  the woman sucks down both vials quickly.  "grab 2 more now!!" he yells once again, "drink them!"  she grabs 2 quickly and says "why, please! this makes no sense"  he cocks the shotgun and in fear of her life,  the woman swallows the last 2 vials.  all of a sudden, the masked man sets down his shotgun, removes his ski mask and says, "see honey, it's not that bad!"	2

a chinese bureaucrat, an indian bureaucrat and an african bureaucrat walk into a bar. they’ve known each other for years, having met every year at un conferences, and they’ve become friends. but, talking over drinks, they realise that they’ve only ever met at conferences. so the chinese bureaucrat suggests that after the next one, in beijing, they come to his house to relax for a few days.  they all agree, and when the next conference ends, they set off. they get a plane at beijing’s airport, fly to a provincial city and speed off down a pristine six-lane highway to a large house in the suburbs.  "this is a really nice house," the african bureaucrat says. "how did you afford it on your government salary?"  "well, did you see that new highway we drove on? i just took some money from the project and spent it on the house."  the other bureaucrats nod, obviously impressed. for the next few days the three men have a wonderful time, and agree to meet again after the next summit, this time at the indian bureaucrat’s house.  a year goes by, the conference ends and they set off. they fly from the airport in delhi to a little provincial town. then they jolt down a long, potholed road until they get to a large mansion.  the chinese bureaucrat, obviously impressed, asks how the indian bureaucrat could have afforded it. the indian bureaucrat replies, "well, did you see that highway we drove on? i just took some money out of the project and spent it on the house."  a year later they are in africa, and they all agree to head to the african bureaucrat’s house. they go to the airport, and fly to a smaller airport in the middle of the jungle. from there they board a helicopter and fly over a pristine jungle to a large palace surrounded by military guards. they look out over trees as far as the eye can see.  the indian and chinese bureaucrats are amazed, and they are both eager to know how he managed to afford such a palace.  "well, did you see that highway we drove on?" the african bureaucrat asks.	2

"i did it just like you explained, but it didn't go quite how you said--she woke up! but on the bright side, your wife gives one hell of a blowjob."	1

it's my cake day today, so i'll give you one of my favourite jokes since 15+ years ago. there is a factory that makes the tickle me elmo toys. the toy laughs when you tickle it under the arms.  well, lena is hired at the tickle me elmo factory and she reports for her first day promptly at 8:00 am.  the next day at 8:45 am there is a knock at the personnel manager’s door. the foreman throws open the door and begins to rant about the new employee.  he complains that she is incredibly slow and the whole line is backing up, putting the entire production line behind schedule.  the personnel manager decides he should see this for himself, so the 2 men march down to the factory floor. when they get there the line is so backed up that there are tickle me elmo’s all over the factory floor and they’re really beginning to pile up.  at the end of the line stands lena surrounded by mountains of tickle me elmo’s. she has a roll of plush red fabric and a huge bag of small marbles.  the 2 men watch in amazement as she cuts a little piece of fabric, wraps it around two marbles and begins to carefully sew the little package between elmo’s legs.  the personnel manager bursts into laughter. after several minutes of hysterics he pulls himself together and approaches lena .  “i’m sorry,” he says to her, barely able to keep a straight face, “but i think you misunderstood the instructions i gave you yesterday.”  “your job is to give elmo two test tickles.”	3

"no problem," said the physician, "i'll get it for you."   while he was gone, one of the attorneys picked up the physician's shoe and spat in it.   when he returned with the coke, the other attorney said, "that looks good, i think i'll have one too."  again, the physician obligingly went to fetch it and while he was gone, the other attorney picked up the other shoe and spat in it.  the physician returned and they all sat back and enjoyed the flight. as the plane was landing, the physician slipped his feet into his shoes and knew immediately what had happened.  "how long must this go on?" he asked.   "this fighting between our professions?   this hatred?   this animosity?   this spitting in shoes and pissing in cokes?"	2

when uncle charlie died of old age, bill was bequeathed his uncle's prized amazon parrot... this  parrot was fully grown -- with a bad attitude and a worse vocabulary.  every other word was an expletive. those that weren't expletives were, to  say the very least, extremely rude.  bill tried hard to change the  bird's attitude and was constantly saying polite words, playing soft  music--anything he could think of to try and set a good example...  nothing worked.   exasperated, he yelled at the bird. but the bird just got  louder. then he shook the parrot. but the bird just got more angry and  more rude.  finally, in a moment of desperation, bill put the parrot in the freezer.  for a few moments he heard the bird squawking, kicking, and screaming... then,  suddenly, all was quiet. bill was frightened that he might have hurt his dead uncle's prized parrot and quickly opened the freezer door.  the  parrot calmly stepped out onto bill's extended arm and said, "i am truly  sorry that i might have offended you with my language and action and i  humbly ask your forgiveness. i will now, from this day forth,endeavor to  correct my behavior so that such an ill-perceived outburst never again occurs."  bill was completely astonished at the bird's change in  attitude and was about to ask what had caused such a dramatic change when the parrot continued, "may i ask what the chicken did?"	3

an american spy goes to russia in soviet russia, an american spy tries to blend in...  george keats had trained 20 years for this moment. he had mastered the russian language in its native accent. he learned all of russia's customs and social graces. he memorized moscow streetmaps and knew every back-alley there was. he swore that he could even think like a russian.  the big day finally came, and he was parachuted to the outskirts of moscow at night. he emerged by daybreak, and hopped onto a bus going to the city center.  "comrade. how much for a ticket to red square?", he asked the conductor in authentic russian.  "5 rubles, comrade american", came the reply.  keats was stunned. perhaps the conductor was just being a smart-ass. he hopped off the bus and asked a passerby for directions to the closest bar.  "it's just around the block, comrade american."  keats' doubts grew immensely. not knowing what to do, he went inside the bar and ordered a glass of vodka.  "want some borscht to go with it, comrade american?", the bartender asked.  keats threw a fit. "what's the matter with you people? i dress just like you, i speak just like you, i even think just like you! why does everyone keep calling me american?"  "well comrade, it's because you're black."﻿	2

there is a fly.... (medium) hovering near the surface of a mountain lake. over on the shore sits a frog. the frog says “if the fly drops four inches, i can eat him.”  just below the surface of the lake is a fish. the fish sees the frog and says “if the fly drops for inches, the frog can get the fly, and i can get the frog.”  on the shore of this lake sits a bear. the bear sees the situation and thinks to himself “if the fly drops four inches, the frog can get the fly, the fish can get the frog, and i can get the fish.”  sitting on the opposite shore sits a hunter. looking over it all, the hunter says to himself “if the fly drops four inches, the frog can get the fly, the fish can get the frog, the bear can get the fish, and i’ll be able to shoot the bear.”   sitting right by the hunter is a mouse. the mouse says to himself “if the fly drops four inches, the frog can get the fly, the fish can get the frog, the bear can get the fish, the hunter will pick up his gun to shoot the bear, dropping his food while doing so, and i can get his food.”  sitting up the hill is a bobcat. the bobcat sees the scenario, and thinks “if the fly drops four inches, the frog can get the fly, the fish can get the frog, the bear can get the fish, the hunter will pick up his gun to shoot the bear, dropping his food while doing so, the mouse gets the food, and while they eat, i can pounce on them.”  so the fly drops four inches. the frog gets the fly, the fish gets the frog, the bear gets the fish, the hunter, dripping his food, gets the bear, and the mouse gets the food. the bobcat, seizing the opportunity, lunges for the mouse, but misses and lands in the lake.   so what’s the moral of the story? if the fly drops four inches, the pussy gets wet.	2

a woman in late forties went to a plastic surgeon for a face lift. the surgeon told her about a new procedure called ‘the knob’ where a small knob is placed on the back of a woman’s head and can be turned to tighten up her skin to produce the effect of a brand-new face lift. it goes without saying that the woman wanted ‘the knob’.   over the years, the woman tightened the knob quite a few times and the effect was wonderful – she remained young looking and vibrant.   after about a decade, the woman returned to the surgeon with two problems. “all these years,” she told the surgeon, “everything has been working just fine. i’ve had to turn the knob many times and i’ve always loved the results. but now i’ve developed two annoying problems. first, i’ve these terrible bags under my eyes and the knob won’t get rid of them.”   “hmmm.” the surgeon looked at her closely and said, “these are not bags, these are your breasts.”   “well,” she said, “i guess that explains the goatee.”	2

two whales are swimming in the ocean and encounter a whale hunting ship. the first whale is furious, and says to the second, “look over there! those are the people that killed our fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, friends! we should take revenge!” the second whale is also angry on hearing this, and agrees, saying, “what should we do?” the first whale thinks for a while, and says, “look, we need to turn that ship over so the people will drown. if we both go underneath it, and blow air from our breathing holes together, the air should turn the ship over.” the second agrees, and they both go to the ship. sure enough, the ship turns over at once and all the people jump aboard into the water. the whales are satisfied and begin to move away. however, the first whale notices the people trying to swim their way to life boats and rafts. being angry, he says, “our vengeance is not complete. we need to destroy those people. let’s go over again and eat them, we’ll gobble them up whole.” the second whale becomes very annoyed at this, and says, “look now, i went along with the blow job, but i am not going to swallow the sea men!”	2
the pope contracts a rare terminal illness. the best specialists were quietly called in from around the world for consultation.after much debate and research they determined that the only hope to save the pope's life was for him to have sexual relations with a woman. his advisors were notified and they in turn spoke in confidence with the pope. the pope informs them that he needs a day to pray about it.  &#x200b;  the next day the pope summons his advisors and has the room sealed.  "my sons, after much prayerful consideration i have an answer. i have decided that you shall arrange for this most unusual treatment to preserve my life, for the good of the church, but on three conditions."  &#x200b;  "what are the conditions, your holiness?"  &#x200b;  "first, the woman that you choose must be blind. for if she sees that she is with the pope, she may either get sense of self-importance as the only woman to ever bed a pope, or she may lose her faith in the sanctity of my station. she must be blind."  &#x200b;  "it will be so, what about the next condition?"  &#x200b;  "for the same reason, she must also be deaf. while i try to be a righteous man, i am a man and as such i may cry out in pleasure during the act. she must not know that she is with the pope, so she must be deaf."  &#x200b;  "very wise, it will be done. what is the third condition?"  &#x200b;  " big tits "	3

an atheist decides he was to be jewish... an atheist is inspired by the jewish philosophy and approach to religion, how it's built around questioning and responding with more and deeper questions. he's not sold on the god stuff, but decides he can look past that if it means getting to engage with a thoughtful, inquisitive community.  so, he goes to see the local rabbi and ask about joining. the rabbi explains it's not so easy. there's a process, and it's a long one, and maybe easier to go back in time and be born to a jewish mother, if truth be told.  but, the atheist says those rules are outdated, and a religious community should be based only on shared beliefs.  the rabbi responds that part of those shared beliefs is a shared respect for the tradition.  but the atheist points out that the tradition is one of questioning the rules.  they go back and forth, on and on, neither giving an inch in the argument until finally the atheist is just exhausted and gives up saying, "fine, i guess if you won't let me join there's nothing i can do about that."  "not let you join?" the rabbi says, "what do you think we've been doing this whole time?"	3

the chicken and the horse (dirty, long) on a farm lived a chicken and a horse, good friends who enjoyed long leisurely walks together.   one day, their walk brought them to a swamp, in which the horse started to sink. "quickly!" he cried, "run to the farmer's garage, throw a rope into his bmw, drive it over here, tie me to it, and pull me out!" the chicken, following the horse's directions, successfully saves the horse from drowning in the swamp.   days later, on another walk, they once again happen upon the swamp, and this time, the chicken gets stuck. "quick!" she cries, "get me out, same as i did you!"  "fortunately," the horse answered, "i don't need the rope, or the car." he then proceeded to pull the chicken out by extending his penis out for her to grab onto, thus saving her from sinking in the swamp.   the moral of the story is, when you're hung like a horse, you don't need a beamer to pick up chicks.	1

a man dies he died tragically and unexpectedly in a botched robbery. devastated, his wife cindy mourned four several months, leaving the house only to pick up groceries that her doting mother leaves on her doorstep.  the only comfort to her grief was his cat, who is similarly distraught. after several months of grieving, she realized she couldn't go on like this. she organized a funeral for her husband.  the funeral was somber, her husband, mac, was a well-liked guy, and it was a close-knit community.  the funeral finished with a long, passionate, and emotional speech by mac's wife.  &#x200b;  it truly moved everyone to tears. after she was done, she stepped aside, then asked, "does anyone have a word or two they'd like to say?"  a man she'd never seen before stands up, his face shadowed by his cowboy hat. slowly, solemnly, and with a strong southern accent, he said "plethora", tipped his hat, then sat back down.  cindy choked back tears, and let out a sob.  tears rolled from her eyes like the boulder after indiana jones.  "thank you, so much, stranger. that means a lot"	2

roger was very thin because he was afraid to spend a lot of money on food. he looked forward to the day when his grandfather would die and leave him a fortune. his grandfather was blessed with both a sense of humor and a sense of justice. so he planned that when he finally died all he would leave to roger was a cookie.  but what a cookie.  it was made with butter, churned from milk from a yak milked by a virginal milkmaid on the highest field on a hidden himalayan peak next to the ultimate source of the sacred ganges river.  it was made with flour harvested from plants of the single-grained einkorn found growing on the site of a neolithic anatolian village and ground between millstones of lapus lazuli.  it was made from eggs collected from peahen nests in the remotest marshes of outback australia.  it was made from sugar boiled from a cane garden in a secret valley in new guinea.  it was flavored with a vanilla pod from the mysterious and still sacred original vanilla vine found by the totonac people when they arrived in the mazatlán valley on the gulf coast of mexico in the 15th century.  it had added flavor, as well, with chocolate chips made from the beans of a cacao tree found on the site of a previously undiscovered mayan temple.  when roger's grandfather died, the cookie was baked by gordon ramsey in a kitchen built exclusively for the purpose.  it was the most expensive cookie ever baked and its ingredients consumed the entire fortune.  the lawyers delivered the cookie to the anorexic roger as his entire inheritance. understandably, all the other relatives were more than a little put out and they paid roger a visit.  they all wanted their share of the fortune but they couldn't find it because it had disappeared into the thin heir.	3

so, there's these two tomatoes who are best friends ... ever since they grew up on the vine together, they've been inseparable. they played little league together, they had home room together all through high school, they even double dated to prom and shared a limo. as time went on, though, they slowly lost touch. during university they slowly lost touch with each other. summer break hangouts, regular texting and online gaming slowly became infrequent emails and facebook likes. produce drifts apart, these things happen.  &#x200b;  one day, though, they get to talking again and decide they need to get back together. that after all this time, they're not only going to celebrate their friendship but renew their commitment to stay best friends. no other friends, no ladies, just the two of them. they both plan time off work, travel back to their hometown and go to their favourite bar. they even arranged with the owner to reserve their favourite booth. and it's like they never lost touch. over multiple pitchers of beer they tell all the old stories and share new laughs. just having a great time of things. over the course of the night, though, the first tomato see's this tasty piece of celery eyeing him from the bar. and she is just gorgeous, a real crisp hottie if you get my meaning. and even though he keeps finding her checking him out, he keeps puts her out of his mind as best he can. tonight is just about best tomatoes forever.  &#x200b;  as the night wears one, the second tomato gets up to let out some of the beer they've been drinking. and he's gone maybe 30 seconds when that celery shakes her stalk across the bar and slides into the empty seat to chat up the first tomato. the first tomato is so blinded with flirting with her that he doesn't see second tomato come back. and he is pissed. 'dude, tonight was supposed to be about us', he says, 'and the second i'm gone you ditch me for a bar tramp?'  &#x200b;  the first tomato tries explaining it isn't like that, that she's hitting on him. he tries begging the second tomato to understand, that he'd never have another shot in a million years with someone as hot as her on any other night. he tries suggesting he go home with and that they reschedule their tomatoes night out for another night. the second tomato doesn't like this. furious, he says that if the one night they were going to celebrate all the years they were friends, the one night they were pledging to making an effort to staying as close as they've been, that he's going to ditch him for a girl he won't remember in a week ... then their friendship never really meant anything.  &#x200b;  the first tomato lets the second go, figuring that they'll both cool down and talk tomorrow. he goes back to chatting up the celery up as the night starts to wind down. meanwhile, the second tomato storms off to the other side of the bar and starts doing shots with group of rowdy beefsteak tomatoes, telling them about how his friend betrayed him over a girl. well, you better believe they don't like hearing about their tomato brother getting stabbed in the back like that and decide to do something about it.  &#x200b;  as the first tomato is waiting outside for the celery to finish powdering her leaves, the table of rowdy tomatoes jump him. they pull him down and lay into him, beating him up and down, screaming and berating him the entire time before leaving him in he gutter to die. it's about this time that the second tomato realizes almost everyone's left and decides to head out himself. when he gets outside, though, he sees his best friend laying beaten on the sidewalk, tomato juice running in the gutter. i mean, he's practically ketchup at this point. he hurriedly calls 911 before cradling his friend, crying and praying to god. he holds his friend the entire ambulance ride. at the hospital he spends three hours pacing back and fourth in the waiting room.  &#x200b;  finally, the doctor comes out. and for synchronicity's sake we'll say the doctor is a carrot. the carrot doctor comes up to the tomato and asks if he wants to hear the good news or the bad news.  &#x200b;  the tomato gets really quite for a moment, before whispering through chapped lips that he needs to hear the good news. the doctor says 'well, it was touch and go for a while, and he's not out of the garden yet, but i think he'll live.' the tomato cries out in relief, thanking the doctor profusely. all that matters is that his friend is gonna live, he can take the bad news so long as he'll live. 'what's the bad news, doc?'  &#x200b;  the doctor says 'well, the beating was quite severe. so, he'll live but he'll be a vegetable for the rest of his life.'	2

a man buys a horse from an old pastor. the pastor explains to the man that in order to make the horse go, he must say "thank god," and to make him stop, he must say "amen." the man nods in understanding.  he gets on the horse, readies himself, takes a deep breath, and says, "thank god!"  immediately, the horse takes off like a jet. the man initially holds on desperately as he tries not to get bucked off by the incredibly fast and agile horse, but eventually he's having the time of his life. at least, until the horse starts heading towards a cliff.  "uhh...stop!" the man says, to no avail. the horse continues galloping towards the cliff.  "stop! stop!" nothing. the man is ready to accept his fate. then suddenly he remembers--  "aaaaaammeeeeeeeeen!!!!!"  the horse screeches to a halt, right at the edge of the cliff. the man breathes a great sigh of relief and says, "oh, thank god."	1

a police officer was waiting along the side of a highway waiting to catch speeding drivers. there weren't as many violators this day as usual. the state police officer sees an old car puttering along at 22 mph. he thinks to himself, "this driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!" so he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over. approaching the car, he notices that there are five elderly ladies, two in the front seat and three in the back--wide eyed and white as ghosts.  the driver, obviously confused, says to him, "officer, i don't understand, i was doing exactly the speed limit! what seems to be the problem?" "ma'am," the officer replies, "you weren't speeding, but you should know that driving slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers." "slower than the speed limit? no sir, i was doing the speed limit exactly... twenty-two miles an hour!" the old woman says a bit proudly. the state police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that "22" was the route number, not the speed limit. a bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error. "but before i let you go, ma'am, i have to ask... is everyone in this car ok? these women seem awfully shaken and they haven’t uttered a single word this whole time," the officer asks with concern.  "oh, they'll be all right in a minute officer. we just got off route 215."	3

a police patrol car parked outside a local neighbourhood pub late in the evening. the officer noticed a man leaving the bar so intoxicated that he could barely walk. the man stumbled around the car park for a few minutes, with the officer quietly observing. after what seemed an eternity and trying his keys on five vehicles. the man managed to find his car, which he fell into. he was there for a few minutes as a number of other patrons left the bar and drove off.    finally he started the car, switched the wipers on and off (it was a fine dry night). then flicked the indicators on, then off, tooted the horn and then switched on the lights.    he moved the vehicle forward a few metres, reversed a little and then remained stationary for a few more minutes as some more vehicles left. at last he pulled out of the car park and started to drive slowly down the road.    the police officer, having patiently waited all this time, now started up the patrol car, put on the flashing lights, promptly pulled the man over and carried out a random breathalyser test.  to his amazement the breathalyser indicated no evidence of the man's intoxication.  the police officer said "i'll have to ask you to accompany me to the police station - this breathalyser equipment must be broken."  "i doubt it," said the man, "tonight i'm the designated decoy."	1

work got cancelled for two weeks, so i go to the grocery store on the way home. i’ve seen all the news, lots of facebook pictures of empty shelves, but i was not prepared for this madness. there’s a line of like five people by the frozen goods aisle, trying to get pizza.  so i decide to go get some ramen. i know it’s not the best, but it keeps forever and i’ve been perfecting my “authentic” ramen recipe.  sure enough, there’s an even longer line there, only two packets per person. and there’s literally a whole aisle of shelves that’s just instant ramen, plastic wrap from the boxes is on the floor, and the person picking out their two packs is being very indecisive... there is a decent sized group waiting, so i head to the cleaning products aisle.  this is where it gets crazy. one store employee is tearing open bulk bags of toilet paper, giving one roll to each customer. and there is another employee putting clorox wipes in baggies, 5 for a dollar. the aisle is packed, shopping carts clacking together. so i decide to just go get some koolaid or fruit punch or whatever.  there is no punch line.	3

one sunny day a rabbit came out of her hole in the ground to enjoy the fine weather. the day was so nice that she became careless and a fox snuck up behind her and caught her.  "i am going to eat you for lunch," said the fox.  "wait," replied the rabbit, "you should at least wait a few days."  "oh yeah? why should i wait?"  "well, i am just finishing my thesis on 'the superiority of rabbits over foxes and wolves.'"  "are you crazy? i should eat you right now! everybody knows that a fox will always win over a rabbit."  "not really, not according to my research. if you like, you can come into my hole and read it for yourself. if you are not convinced, you can go ahead and have me for lunch."  "you really are crazy!" but since the fox was curious and had nothing to lose, it went with the rabbit. the fox never came out.  a few days later the rabbit was again taking a break from writing and sure enough, a wolf came out of the bushes and was ready to set upon her.  "wait!" yelled the rabbit, "you can't eat me right now."  "and why might that be, my furry appetizer?"  "i am almost finished writing my thesis on 'the superiority of rabbits over foxes and wolves.'"  the wolf laughed so hard that it almost lost its grip on the rabbit.  "maybe i shouldn't eat you; you really are sick ... in the head. you might have something contagious."  "come and read it for yourself; you can eat me afterward if you disagree with my conclusions." so the wolf went down into the rabbit's hole ... and never came out.  the rabbit finished her thesis and was out celebrating in the local lettuce patch. another rabbit came along and asked, "what's up? you seem very happy."  "yup, i just finished my thesis."  "congratulations. what's it about?"  "'the superiority of rabbits over foxes and wolves.'"  "are you sure? that doesn't sound right."  "oh yes. come and read it for yourself."  so together they went down into the rabbit's hole. as they entered, the friend saw the typical graduate abode, albeit a rather messy one after writing a thesis. the computer with the controversial work was in one corner.  and to the right there was a pile of fox bones, on the left a pile of wolf bones.  and in the middle was a large, well-fed lion.  the moral of the story: the title of your thesis doesn't matter. the subject doesn't matter. the research doesn't matter.  all that matters is who your advisor is	3

what causes arthritis? a man smelling of booze and cigarettes sat down on a subway next to apriest. his tie was stained, there was red lipstick on his collar and faceand a half-empty bottle of gin was sticking out of his torn coat pocket. he opened his newspaper and began reading.  after a few minutes the man turned to the priest and asked, "tell me father, do you happen to know what causes arthritis?"  the priest replies, "my son, it's caused by loose living, consorting with cheap, wicked women, too much alcohol, contempt for your fellow man, sleeping around with prostitutes and lack of a bath."  the drunk muttered in response, "well, i'll be damned," then returned to his paper.  the priest, thinking about what he had said, nudged the man and apologized. "i'm very sorry. i didn't mean to come on so strong. how long have you had arthritis?"  the man answered, "i don't have it, father. i was just reading here that the pope suffers from it."	1

"no, you don't understand!" she replies. "i changed my mind, i'm taking a crap instead."	3

"oh, i don't know," said the atheist. "how about why there is no god, or no heaven or hell, or no life after death?" as he smiled smugly.  "okay," she said. "those could be interesting topics but let me ask you a question first. a horse, a cow, and a deer all eat the same stuff - grass. yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, but a horse produces clumps. why do you suppose that is?"  the atheist thinks about it and says, "hmmm, i have no idea." to which the girl replies, "do you really feel qualified to discuss god, heaven and hell, or life after death, when you don't know shit?"  the atheist pauses for a moment, and considers the question. "well," he says, "i'm no biologist but i'd assume it's got something to do with how their guts are arranged. you're right though. you'd have to be pretty into horseshit and bullshit to know much about god."	2

"wow! exclaimed the others, "how did you get that?!"  "well", the pessimist offered gloomily, "i found some tracks, and after walking for ever and ever, i saw the deer and boom! i shot him."  "that doesn't sound so bad!" exclaimed the optimist. and with that the optimist left camp to go hunt.  not too long after they return dragging a ten point buck behind them.  "that's amazing!" cried the others, "how on earth did you manage that?"  "just like the pessimist", smiled the optimist, "i found some tracks, followed them, and boom! i shot myself a ten point buck!"  "this is going to be easy." stated the literalist. "you've both shown exactly what i need to do, so i'm bound to have the best kill off all!" and with that, the literalist left camp.  hours passed. night fell, and morning came, all with no sign of the literalist. the other two became extremely worried and agreed to go look for them. but just before they left, the literalist appeared.  they dragged themselves along the ground, beaten and bloodied, clinging to life.  "what happened?!" cried the others.  "i don't understand," gasped the literalist, "i did exactly what you both did - i found some tracks, i followed the tracks, and boom! i got hit by a train!"	2

like oh shit, i’m in the shower now. 132. you ever fart so hard in your car that the windows just go down automatically 133. i told my kids since we don’t have a chimney santa just comes in like a swat team 134. the only reason i'd ever wanna be skinny was if there was something delicious at the other end of a small diameter pipe. 135. my mom asked if she should call my deceased father bob or dad. i said i really don't think it matters. 136. “god dammit sam that’s mayonnaise not vanilla!” and that was my last day at the cake shop. 137. people ask me. “hey sam do you like really small things?” i say “not particularly.” 138. i’m gonna start a store where people donate old scarves and then we sell the yarn back to people. we’ll call it “knit pickers” 139. the same people that blame me for not staying on task are usually the same people that ask me to do boring shit.	3

a woman is attending her 98 year old grandfathers funeral after the service her and her family head back to her grandmothers home and she finally has the chance to talk to her grandmother alone.  she first shows her sympathy then she asks her grandmother exactly how her grandfather died, her grandmother looked at her then made sure nobody was around and said "he died while we were having sex"  the woman was mortified, "grandmother" she said., you are 97 years old that is way too old to be having sex. her grandmother said, "i'm well aware of my age my dear and your grandfather and i had it figured out."   we still loved each other and wanted to make love as much as we could but because of our age we would only have sex on sundays when we could hear the church bells,   the bells would help your grandfather keep a steady pace and not over exert himself, he would listen to the bells while we made love, and he would go in on the ding and out on the dong   the grandmother then let out a long sigh and said  "and if it wasn't for that damn ice cream truck he'd still be with us today!"	3

only australians and/or new zealanders will get this joke a large man walks into a bar and looks for a place to sit. every stool and table is taken but at the end of the bar is a little man drinking a beer by himself. so, the big man walks up behind him and slaps him across the back of head and he falls to the floor.  the little man gets up rubbing his head and yells; "what the fuck was that about?!". the big man smiles and says; "that was a karate chop from china."  the little man decides to ignore the big man so gets back on his stool. the big man promptly grabs the little man by the shirt and throws him across the room.  the little man gets up and yells across the bar; "what the fuck was that?!". again, the big man smiles and says; "that was a judo throw from japan."  the little man screams and storms out of the bar. he comes back about 20 minutes later and sees the big man sitting on his bar stool drinking his beer. he walks up behind him, jumps up, and smacks him across the back of the head. he drops to the ground unconscious.  the entire bar stands in stunned silence and the little man turns to address them; "when he wakes up, tell him that was a crow bar from bunnings."  for those of you who are confused; bunnings is the big chain of hardware stores in this part of the world.	2

"what part of the human body expands ten times normal size during periods of intense excitement?" a professor gives his physiology class a spot quiz. one question he asks is, "what part of the human anatomy expands to ten times its normal size during periods of intense emotion and excitement?" he picks a rather overdressed girl in the front row to answer it. "miss callahan!" the indicated girl, who heard the question, stammers with some embarrassment: "professor, i'd rather not answer that question." the professor says, "that's all right, miss callahan, you don't need to answer it. is there anyone present who can answer it?" he notes an interested face in the back of the classroom. "mr. hawkins!" hawkins says, "yes, professor, it is the pupil of the eye that expands to ten times its normal size during periods of emotion and excitement." the professor says, "that is correct, mr. hawkins." then he turns to miss callahan. he says, "young lady, two things are obvious from your reaction to this question. one, you haven't studied this week's assignment; and two, i'm afraid marriage is going to be a tremendous disappointment to you.	3

"what happened, jonesie? where is the lion? " asked the chief. "forget the damn lion! " he howled. "which one of you idiots let the bull loose? "	1

government a cowboy named bud was overseeing his herd in a remote mountainous pasture in california when suddenly a brand-new bmw advanced toward him out of a cloud of dust.  the driver, a young man in a brioni suit, gucci shoes, ray ban sunglasses and ysl tie, leaned out the window and asked the cowboy, "if i tell you exactly how many cows and calves you have in your herd, will you give me a calf?"   bud looks at the man, obviously a yuppie, then looks at his peacefully grazing herd and calmly answers, "sure, why not?"   the yuppie parks his car, whips out his dell notebook computer, connects it to his cingular razr v3 cell phone, and surfs to a nasa page on the internet, where he calls up a gps satellite to get an exact fix on his location which he then feeds to another nasa satellite that scans the area in an ultra-high-resolution photo..   the young man then opens the digital photo in adobe photoshop and exports it to an image processing facility in hamburg , germany ..   within seconds, he receives an email on his palm pilot that the image has been processed and the data stored. he then accesses an ms-sql database through an odbc connected excel spreadsheet with email on his blackberry and, after a few minutes, receives a response..   finally, he prints out a full-color, 150-page report on his hi-tech, miniaturized hp laserjet printer, turns to the cowboy and says, "you have exactly 1,586 cows and calves."   "that's right. well, i guess you can take one of my calves," says bud. he watches the young man select one of the animals and looks on with amusement as the young man stuffs it into the trunk of his car.   then bud says to the young man, "if i can tell you exactly what your business is, will you give me back my calf?"   the young man thinks about it for a second and then says, "okay, why not?"   "you're a congressman for the u.s. government", says bud.   "wow! that's correct," says the yuppie, "but how did you guess that?"   "no guessing required." answered the cowboy. "you showed up here even though nobody called you; you want to get paid for an answer i already knew, to a question i never asked. you used millions of dollars worth of equipment trying to show me how much smarter than me you are; and you don't know a thing about how working people make a living - or about cows, for that matter.    this is a herd of sheep. .....    now give me back my dog.	3

nsfw while i was sitting in the bar one night drinking alone a stunner of a woman walked up to the bar sat down right next to me. a booty to die for and rack that hadn’t fallen yet, i couldn’t help taking a glance at her. she smiled back at me, and not in an unkindly way.  i asked if i could buy her the next drink. she accepted. we started talking. she showed me pictures of her and a stunning blonde in her mid twenties. after another drink, she asked me how old i thought she was.  just to be cheeky i said thirty five, obviously she was totally milf material. she knew the flirt for what it was, but laughed anyway. she said she was actually fifty. we flirted some more, things got heated up and then she whispered if i wanted to go to her place for a mother daughter three way. i nearly choked on my beer. she chuckled heartily.  i asked if she was serious. oh yes she said, she has been wanting one for years now. i couldn’t believe my luck. i hurriedly finished my beer and ordered us a cab to her place.  on the way back to her place we started kissing and nearly doing it in front of the driver. man if she was this good and eager i couldn’t wait to meet her daughter. we get out and stumble up the driveway to the door.   once inside, she closes the door and yells.  “hey mom, get down here i got us a bloke!”	3

on their wedding night, the young bride approached her new husband and asked for $20.00 for their first lovemaking encounter. in his highly aroused state, her husband readily agreed. this scenario was repeated each time they made love, for more than 30 years, with him thinking that it was a cute way for her to afford new clothes and other incidentals that she needed.  arriving home around noon one day, she was surprised to find her husband in a very drunken state. during the next few minutes, he explained that his employer was going through a process of corporate downsizing, and he had been let go. it was unlikely that, at the age of 59, he'd be able to find another position that paid anywhere near what he'd been earning, and therefore, they were financially ruined. calmly, his wife handed him a bank book which showed more than thirty years of steady deposits and interest totaling nearly $1 million. then she showed him certificates of deposits issued by the bank which were worth over $2 million, and informed him that they were one of the largest depositors in the bank. she explained that for the more than three decades she had 'charged' him for sex, these holdings had multiplied and these were the results of her savings and investments.  faced with evidence of cash and investments worth over $3 million, her husband was so astounded he could barely speak, but finally he found his voice and blurted out, 'if i'd had any idea what you were doing, i would have given you all my business!'	2

so this city blonde goes to a barn she asks the farmer: “excuse me, why does that cow have no horns?”.   the farmer, being quite the expert on the matter, explained to her with great detail:   “well m’am, there’s many reasons why some cows don’t have horns. some breeds don’t have horns. for example: angus cows don’t have horns. another reason is that when you’ve been milking a cow for too long, their horns get very sensitive, so we remove them in a process that’s completely painless to the animal. and sometimes, when they’re calves, we don’t want them to grow horns so we put a little acid where the horns would grow and they never grow horns.   but the reason why that cow doesn’t have horns is because it’s a horse”.	3

"i'll have the same," said the ostrich.   a short time later the waitress returned with the order saying, "that will be $6.40 please." so the man reached into his pocket and pulled out the exact change for payment.     the next day, the man and the ostrich came again and the man said, "i'll have a hamburger, fries and a coke." then the ostrich said, "i'll have the same." once again the man reached into his pocket and paid with exact change.     this became a routine until late one evening, the two entered again. "the usual?" asked the waitress. "no, it is friday night, so i will have a steak, baked potato, and salad," said the man. "same for me," said the ostrich. a short time later the waitress came with the order and said, "that will be $12.62." once again the man pulled the exact change out of his pocket and placed it on the table. the waitress couldn't hold back her curiosity any longer.     "excuse me, sir. how do you manage to always come up with the exact change out of your pocket every time?" "well," said the man, "several years ago i was cleaning the attic and i found an old lamp. when i rubbed it a genie appeared and offered me two wishes. my first wish was that if i ever had to pay for anything, i would just put my hand in my pocket and the right amount of money would always be there." "that's brilliant!" said the waitress. "most people would wish for a million dollars or something, but you'll always be as rich as you want for as long as you live!" "that's right. whether it's a gallon of milk or a tesla, the exact money is always there," said the man. the waitress asked, "one other thing, sir, what's with the ostrich?" the man sighed, paused, and answered, "my second wish was for a tall chick with long legs who agrees with everything i say."	3

a mother is in the kitchen making dinner for her family when her daughter walks in. “mother, where do babies come from?”, she asks.  the mother thinks for a few seconds and says, “well dear, mommy and daddy fall in love and get married. one night they go into their bedroom, they kiss and hug, and have sex.”   the daughter looks puzzled so the mother continues, “that means the daddy puts his penis in the mommy’s vagina. that’s how you get a baby, honey.”   the child seems to comprehend. “oh, i see, but the other night when i came into your room you had daddy’s penis in your mouth. what do you get when you do that?”   “jewelry, my dear. jewelry.”	3

[long]husband takes wife to play golf. husband takes his wife to play her first game of golf.   of course, the wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the biggest house adjacent to the course.   the husband shouted , "i warned you to be careful! now we'll have apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us."   so the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door.   a warm voice said, "come on in." when they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the broken window.   a man reclining on the couch asked, "are you the people that broke my window?"   "uh...yeah, sir. we're sure sorry about that," the husband replied.   "oh, no apology is necessary. actually i want to thank you. you see, i'm a ghost, and i've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. now that you've released me, i'm allowed to grant three wishes. i'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, i'll keep the last one for myself."   "wow, that's great!" the husband said. he pondered a moment and blurted out, "i'd like a million dollars a year for! the rest of my life."  "no problem," said the ghost. "you've got it, it's the least i can do. and i'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!"   "and now you, young lady, what do you want?" the ghost asked. "i'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every country in the world," she said.   "consider it done," the ghost said. "and your homes will always be safe from fire,burglary and natural disasters!"   "and now," the couple asked in unison, "what's your wish, ghost?"   "well, since i've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have your wife."   the husband looked at his wife and said, "honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. what do you think?"   she mulled it over for a few moments and said, "you know, you're right. considering our good fortune, i guess i wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?"   "you know i love you sweetheart," said the husband.   "i'd do the same for you!" so the ghost and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon. the ghost was insatiable.  after about three hours of non-stop fun, the ghost  looked directly into her eyes and asked, "how old are you and your husband?"   "why, we're both 35," she responded breathlessly. ghost smile –  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  really???  thirty-five years old and both of you still believe in ghosts???	1

an 80yr old couple go to the doctors for a routine check up. the doctor comes back with the results and says "physically you are both fit as fiddles for your age. however mentally you are both beginning to lose it a bit. my suggestion for now is write things down when you think of them, that way you can keep on top of your to-do's".  so they go home, relatively happy. as they are relaxing in the living room watching tv, the man gets up and walks towards the kitchen. he turns to his wife and asks "would you like anything from the kitchen dear".  she replies "oo yes please, can i have some ice cream?"  "sure thing" says the husband.   "dont you think you should follow the doctors advice and write it down?" asks the wife.  "nah i'll remember it honey" he says.  "but i'd like strawberries with it too"   "okay" he says "but i dont need to write it down, i'll remember it"  the wife says "but i'd also like whipped cream with it too".  "yep, not a problem" he says.  "are you sure you don't want to write this down?" she asks, concerned.  "i'll remember it all, don't you worry" he replies and goes into the kitchen.   he's in the kitchen for a good 20 minutes and just as the wife starts to wonder what hes doing, he comes through the door with a plate of sausages, bacon and eggs.  she looks at the plate with a mixture of confusion and annoyance. she then looks at him, frowns and says "where's my toast?"	3

"pretend you're a statue."     when her husband entered the bedroom, he asked, "what's this, honey?"     "oh, it's just a statue," she replied nonchalantly. "the smiths have one in their bedroom. i liked theirs so much, i got us one, too." nothing more was said, and they both went to sleep. about 2:00 am, the husband got out of bed, went to the kitchen, and returned shortly with a sandwich and a glass of milk.     "here," he said, giving the food to the statue, "you may as well eat something. i stood like an idiot at the smiths' for three days and nobody even offered me a glass of water!"	1

one fine saturday morning, the husband wakes up early and goes outside to tend to the animals on the farm. when he returns, he grabs his gun, wakes his wife up, and declares "woman: we're goin' hunting."  stirred awake by his words, she replies "awww husband, i don't want to go hunting."  "woman, you know the rules. if you don't do what i want to do on a saturday morning, you've got to suck me off and i get to fuck you up the ass."  sighing, she acknowledges the rule and damns the day she agreed to that terrible bit of negotiation. "husband, i really don't want to go hunting. you can have your blowjob, but i'm feeling a bit tender, can we forget about the ass bit just this once?"  considering for a moment, the husband agrees "all right, lets get to it."  the wife begins the blowjob and instantly gags, spitting and screaming profanities.  "jesus christ husband, this tastes like shit!"  "that'd be right, the dogs didn't want to go hunting either".	1

john runs a booming 5-star hotel business in his town. one day, a bald headed guy comes to his hotel and asks for room 690 specifically.   "but sir, that room is already occupied. we could give you another room."  "i'll pay you ten times more. i need that room."  john, obviously lured by the money, gives him the room. but the bald headed guy puts forward another peculiar request.   "i also need a rope and a hammer. i'll pay you as much as i paid for the room for that."  john hands him with the rope and hammer. the bald headed guy goes into the room and doesn't come out until the next morning. he pays as much as he promised and walks away. a curious john checks his room and to his surprise, it was left the same way he gave him.  few months later, the bald headed guy comes back and asks for the same unusual request but this time promising to pay more. john was very curious this time and stays outside his room the entire night hoping he could figure out what he was upto. to his surprise, he hears absolute silence and nothing else.  the next morning, when the bald headed guy made his payment, john asks him what he's upto.  "i can't tell you that. it's a secret i'll carry with me to my grave."  an year later, the bald headed guy comes back. takes a rope and hammer and goes into room 690. john tries his best to hear something, but nothing. he couldn't take it anymore. he asks the bald headed guy next morning.   "i told you. it's a secret i'm not willing to share."  "please! i need to know what you've been doing. the curiosity is eating me alive!"   after a lot of pleading and begging, the bald headed guy finally decides to reveal the secret.  "but you'll have to promise that you'll take this to your grave."  "yes! i will! please tell me the secret!"  "you have to make a very genuine and truthful promise. will you do that?"  "yes! i promise!"  "ok. here you go."  well, john turned out to be pretty good at keeping promises.	3
a destitute man is walking the streets looking for a job. eventually, he comes to a whorehouse with a "help wanted" sign in the window. he walks in the whorehouse and asks the manager about the job offer in the window. the manager says, "well we need a bookkeeper at this here whorehouse, so, there are some things you'll need to be able to do." "like what?" says the man. "well, can you read?" "no." "can you write?" "no." "can you at least add or subtract?" "well no i can't do that either," the man says. "but i'm desperate for a job! i haven't a penny to my name and i'm starving!" "well, alright here's a quarter to buy yourself something to eat," the manager gives him. the destitute man walks out of the whorehouse and by some chance, a man is walking by with a cartful of apples for sale for 25 cents. the man buys one and just as he's about to take a bite of it, another homeless man says "hey i'll give you 50 cents for that apple!" thinking about it, the man agrees and gives him the apple. he then goes back to the applecart and buys two more apples for 25 cents a piece and sells them for 50 cents. this carries on for a while and years later he is the manager of the largest fruit shipping company in the us and he's worth millions of dollars.   eventually, a reporter finds out about this man's past and he decides to write a story about him in the paper. but, before he can write the story the man needs to sign an agreement for the paper to use his story. "well i can't do that," says the man. "well why not?" "i can't read or write how do you expect me to sign my name?" the reporter is baffled, "you're the owner of the largest shipping company in the us and you cant read or write? think of where you'd be if you could!" "well i'd probably be a bookkeeper in a whorehouse"  first post, mobile, my boss told me this at work, etc.	3

a lemon, a potato and a pea had a tough week at the grocery store..... ...so they decided to let off some steam with a bar crawl at the weekend.  they had a great time, hitting bar after bar, knocking back drinks, but being so genetically different, the alcohol affected them each in different ways: the lemon got very acidic and refluxy; the potato, being a big starchy chap, took the booze in his stride; while the little pea reacted to all the sugar and started to get a touch hyperactive.  at the end of the night, the three friends found themselves leaving a bar at the top of a tall hill, when all of a sudden the pea started bouncing up and down excitedly: "lads! lads! i've got a great idea! we’re all vaguely round in shape, let's not get a cab home, let's just roll down the hill!" and before the others could protest he was off - shooting down the hill at a rate of knots.  the lemon lurched after him, but soon started listing violently from side to side as he went, owing to his oval shape, which did nothing for his unsettled stomach. with a sigh, the potato trundled along slowly behind.  by the time the potato had bounced his way to the bottom of the hill, the lemon was spewing lemon juice all over the pavement, but the pea was already jumping up and down again "that was great, that was great, let's do it again!".  the lemon was now chundering up pips with the acid, but the pea didn't seem to care "come on! let's go again, that was great!".  the potato turned to him and said "easy peasy, lemon's queasy."	2

hell explained   the following is an actual question given on a university of arizona chemistry midterm, and an actual answer turned in by a student.  the answer by one student was so 'profound' that the professor shared it with colleagues, via the internet, which is, of course, why we now have the pleasure of enjoying it as well:   bonus question: is hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?   most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using boyle's law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.   one student, however, wrote the following: first, we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time. so we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into hell and the rate at which they are leaving, which is unlikely. i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. therefore, no souls are leaving. as for how many souls are entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today.   most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to hell. with birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because boyle's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the volume of hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.   this gives two possibilities:   1. if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose.   2. if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over.   so which is it?   if we accept the postulate given to me by teresa during my freshman year that, 'it will be a cold day in hell before i sleep with you,' and take into account the fact that i slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus i am sure that hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. the corollary of this theory is that since hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct..... ...leaving only heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, teresa kept shouting "oh my god."        this student received an a+.	3

a nun, badly in need of a restroom, walked into a local hooters. the place was hopping with music and load conversations and every once in a while, the lights would go out. each time the lights would go out, the place would erupt in cheers.   the nun walked up to the bartender and asked, “may i please use the restroom?”  the bartender replied, “ok, but i must warn you that there is a statue of a naked man in there wearing only a fig leaf.”  “well, in that case, i’ll just look the other way,” said the nun. so the bartender showed the nun to the restroom.   while the nun was in the bathroom the place erupted in cheers louder than normal, but the nun thought nothing of it.   when the nun exited the restroom, the bartender said, “didn’t expect that!” and clapped the nun on the back.   the nun asked, “what do you mean?” with a puzzled look on her face as the bartender offered her a drink.   “well,” the bartender replied, “the lights only blink when someone checks behind the fig leaf!”     p.s. i am on mobile so please forgive me for bad english.	3

"no, ma'am," said the first officer. "captain goldberg never makes mistakes."	3

two sisters... one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch.  unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble. in  order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to  purchase a bull from the stockyard in a far town so that they can breed  their own stock.    they only have $600 left. upon leaving, the brunette tells her sister, "when i get there, if i decide to buy the bull, i'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home."    the brunette arrives at the stockyard, inspects the bull, and decides  she wants to buy it. the man tells her that he will sell it for $599, no  less. after paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her  sister a telegram to tell her the news. she walks into the telegraph  office and says, "i want to send a telegram to my sister telling her  that i've bought a bull for our ranch. i need her to hitch the trailer  to our pickup truck and drive out here so we can haul it home."    the telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her, then  adds, "it's just 99 cents a word." well, after paying for the bull, the  brunette only has $1 left. she realizes that she'll only be able to send  her sister one word.    after a few minutes of thinking, she nods and says, "i want you to send her one word: comfortable."    the operator shakes his head. 'how is she ever going to know that you  want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to  haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word  "comfortable?"    the brunette explains, "my sister's blonde. the word's big. she'll read it very slowly ... com-for-da-bull."	3

an old couple talks to their doctor about their memory loss. the doctor suggests that they write things down so they don't forget. one day, both of them are sitting on the couch when grandma asks for a bowl of ice cream.  "coming right up," gramps says, slowly getting onto his feet and heading towards the kitchen.  "aren't you going to write that down?"  "write that down? of course not. i can remember a bowl of ice cream."  grandma then requests to have one scoop of vanilla and one scoop of chocolate. gramps again says yes.  "aren't you going to write *that* down?"  "hell no! one scoop of vanilla and one scoop of chocolate. easy to remember."  feeling testy, grandma finishes her order with whipped cream, fudge, and a cherry on top. "surely you're going to write all *that* down."  "do you take me for a fool!? i can remember all that just fine! vanilla, chocolate, whipped cream, fudge, cherry. i'll be back in a few."  grandma waits for 15 minutes. she can hear the clanging of pots and pans as well as something sizzling on the stove. finally, gramps returns with a plate of bacon and eggs.  grandma takes one look at the plate. then at him. then the plate again. then back at him. she stares into his eyes with pity and sighs. "see? this is why i told you to write things down.  *you forgot the toast!"*	3

my girlfriend and i had been dating for over a year... ...and so we decided to get married. my parents helped us in every way, my friends encouraged me, and my girlfriend? she was a dream! there was only one thing bothering me, very much indeed, and that one thing was her younger sister. my prospective sister-in-law was twenty years of age, wore tight mini skirts and low cut blouses. she would regularly bend down when near me and i got many a pleasant view of her underwear. it had to be deliberate. she never did it when she was near anyone else.   one day her little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. she was alone when i arrived. she whispered to me that soon i was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. she told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before i got married and committed my life to her sister. i was in total shock and couldn't say a word. she said, "i'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me." i was stunned. i was frozen in shock as i watched her go up the stairs. when she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. i stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. i opened the door and stepped out of the house. i walked straight towards my car. my future father-in-law was standing outside. with tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, "we are very happy that you have passed our little test. we couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. welcome to the family".  the moral of this story is:  always keep your condoms in your car.	3

a businessman is getting ready to go on a long business trip. he knows his wife is always horny, so he decides to get her something to keep her occupied while he was gone, because he didn’t much like the idea of her screwing someone else. so he went to a store that sold sex toys and started looking around. he thought about a life-sized sex doll, but that was too close to another man for him. he was browsing through the dildos, looking for something special to please his wife, and started talking to the old man behind the counter. he explained his situation, to the old man.  “well, i don’t really know of anything that will do the trick. we have vibrating dildos, special attachments, and so on, but i don’t know of anything that will keep her occupied for weeks, except a” said the old man, and then he stopped.  “except what?” asked the businessman.  “nothing, nothing,” said the old man.  “c’mon, tell me! i need something!” protested the businessman.“well, sir, i don’t usually mention this, but there is the ‘voodoo dildo,’” the old man said.  “the voodoo dildo?” the businessman asked.  the old man reached under the counter, and pulled out an old wooden box carved with strange symbols. he opened it, and there lay a very ordinary-looking dildo. the businessman laughed, and said, “big fucking deal. it looks like every other dildo in this shop!”  the old man said, “but you haven’t seen what it’ll do yet.”  he pointed to a door and said “voodoo dildo, the door.”  the voodoo dildo rose out of its box, darted over to the door, and started screwing the keyhole. the whole door shook with the vibrations, and a crack developed down the middle. before the door could split, the old man said, “voodoo dildo, box!”  the voodoo dildo stopped, floated back to the box and lay there, motionless.  the businessman said, “i’ll take it!”  the guy took it home to his wife, told her it was a special dildo and that to use it, all she had to do was say, “voodoo dildo, my pussy.”  he left for his trip satisfied things would be fine while he was gone.  after he’d been gone a few days, the wife was unbearably horny. she thought of several people who would willingly satisfy her, but then she remembered the voodoo dildo. she lay down, placed the box between her legs, and said “voodoo dildo, my pussy!” the voodoo dildo shot to her crotch and started pumping. it was great, like nothing she’d ever experienced before.  after three orgasms, she decided she’d had enough, and tried to pull it out, but it was stuck in her, still thrusting. she tried and tried to get it out, but nothing worked. her husband had forgot to tell her how to shut it off! so she decided to go to the hospital to see if they could help. she put her clothes on, got in the car and started to drive to the hospital, quivering with every thrust of the dildo. on the way, another orgasm nearly made her swerve off the road, and she was pulled over by a policeman. he asked for her license, and then asked how much she’d had to drink. gasping and twitching, she explained that she hadn’t been drinking, but that a voodoo dildo was stuck in her pussy, and wouldn’t stop screwing her.  the officer looked at her for a second, and then said, “yeah, right. voodoo dildo, my ass!"	3

i met my girlfriend in high school, we were immediately best friends and spent days together having the most fun i had ever had. then one day i asked her the question.  she said yes!  we were so happy together and we stayed together through high school. we both finished college together, we both got jobs together and eventually we both bought a house.  one day at work this new guy comes in called joe and it says he has a confidential past and he never seemed to want to talk about where he was from so me and my coworkers never found out where he was from. me and joe both talk together but i wouldn’t say we were best friends. a couple weeks later joe comes in late and sad. he explains that he was evicted from his last house and was broke. feeling bad for him, i offer to let him stay at our place in the guest room to which he accepts immediately and looks like he just won the lottery.  now, i worked 9-5 and joe worked 8-4 so he would get home before me and chill in his room trying to find an apartment somewhere.  one day i decide i want to pop the question to my girlfriend so i buy a ring and invite her out to a nice restaurant. once we finish desert i get down on one knee and pop the question to her. she tears up but explains how joe had been sexually touching and abusing her while i was away.  furious i pay and bolt it back to the house where he’s sat in the living room watching tv. i walk up to him and punch him right in the eye. his eye swells up like cotton and i yell at him to pack up and leave immediately.  over the next couple months i help her recover from it and about a year later we get married and she accepts.  about two years after joe left we had moved to another town about an hour away and while walking to work i run into an old friend and we have a little chat about our workplaces. he explains he works at a company as a manger and recruits new people often. i ask about any new people he’s signed and he explains a man called joe that came in. i ask about the last name and yep. it’s that joe.  my mind starts wizzing and i tell my friend,  if it weren’t for cotton eye joe, i would’ve been married a long time ago. where did he come from, where did he go? where did he come from cotton eye joe.	2

the madam opened the brothel door in elko county, nevada, and saw a rather dignified, well-dressed, good-looking man in his late forties or early fifties. “may i help you, sir?" she asked.  "i want to see valerie," the man replied.  "sir, valerie is one of our most expensive ladies. perhaps you would prefer someone else," said the madam.  "no, i must see valerie," he replied.  just then, valerie appeared and announced to the man she charged $10,000 a visit.  without hesitation, the man pulled out ten thousand dollars and gave it to valerie, and they went upstairs. after an hour, the man calmly left.  the next night, the man appeared again, once more demanding to see valerie.  valerie explained that no one had ever come back two nights in a row as she was so very expensive. there were no discounts and the price was still $10,000. the gentleman did not blink an eye. again, he pulled out a wad of cash, gave it to valerie, and they went upstairs. after an hour, he left.  the following night the man was there yet again. everyone was astounded that he had come for a third consecutive night, maybe a record in the history of brothels in nevada, which date back into the early 1800s. but without hesitation he paid valerie the ten grand and off they went upstairs.  after their session, valerie said to the man, "no one has ever been with me three nights in a row. where are you from?"  the man replied, "billings, montana."  "really," she said. "i have family in billings."  "i know," the man said. "i regret to tell you, but your sister died, and i am her attorney. she asked me to give you your $30,000 inheritance."  the moral of the story is that three things in life are certain:  1. death  2. taxes  3. being screwed by a lawyer	3

a recently married couple... ... just purchased their first place together.  it was a beautiful apartment in a high rise with a balcony on the kitchen overlooking the park.  one day, the husband comes home from work early to surprise his wife.  but to his surprise he finds her naked in bed.    enraged, he shouts "where is he?" to which his wife replies "i don't know what you are talking about!" the husband begins searching furiously for his wife's lover.  he looks under the bed, in the closets, behind drapes, everywhere a person could be hiding with no luck.  frustrated, he steps out onto the kitchen balcony to have a cigarette.  while lighting the cigarette, he notices fingers holding onto the balcony.  the husband, realizing his opportunity to quickly end the man who was sleeping with his wife, stomps on his fingers and the man falls two stories into a tree which saved him from death.  the husband saw the man moving on the ground and immediately went into the kitchen, unplugged the fridge, pushed it out onto the balcony and over the railing.  crashing through the tree, the fridge lands square on the man and crushes him dead.   in front of st. peter at the gates of heaven stands three men.  st. peter says to the first "welcome to heaven, please state the manner of death and then you may proceed."   the first man says "well, i came home from work early one day and caught my wife having an affair.  the clever fuck hid by hanging from my balcony.  i found him and sent him falling to the ground.  unfortunately, he did not die, so i pushed the fridge over the rail to crush him and while doing so had a heart attack and died."   st. peter says "i'm sorry to hear that tragic end, welcome to heaven."   the second man approaches and explains "i was working out on my balcony when i lifted too much weight and lost my balance and fell over the railing.  luckily, i was able to catch onto the balcony below and save my life.  but then some lunatic stomped on my fingers and i fell to the ground!  fortunately, several tree branches slowed me down and i survived.  but then a fridge came out of nowhere and crushed me!"   st. peter says "oh my, what a terrible day.  welcome to heaven!"   the third man approaches and explains "you see st. peter, i was fucking this guy's wife and he came home from work early, so i hid in the fridge."	3

"you know," he says, "i have two male parrots, very devout birds, whom i have taught to pray and read the bible.  bring your female parrots to my house, and we'll put them in the cage with francis and job.  my parrots can teach your parrots to praise and worship and speak in a more appropriate manner." "thank you," the woman responds, "this may very well be the solution." the next day, she brings her two female parrots to the priest's house.  as he ushers her in, she sees his two male parrots inside their cage, holding rosary beads and praying.  impressed, she walks over and places her parrots in with them.  after a few minutes, the female birds cry out in unison: "hi, we're prostitutes. do you want to have some fun?" there is a stunned silence. finally, one male parrot looks over at the other male parrot and exclaims,  "put the beads away, francis, our prayers have been answered!"	3

the mystery of the murder of crows  (this is my favorite joke that i read on here years ago, i haven't seen it in a while... figure it's time for a repost... forgive me if it's been more recent then i believe)  researchers for the massachusetts turnpike authority (mta) found over 200 dead crows near greater boston recently, and there was concern that they may have died from avian flu. a bird pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was definitely not avian flu. the cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.  however, during the detailed analysis it was noted that varying colors of paints appeared on the bird's beaks and claws. by analyzing these paint residues it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks, while only 2% were killed by an impact with a car.  mta then hired an ornithological behaviorist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.  the ornithological behaviorist very quickly concluded the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.  the scientific conclusion was that while all the lookout crows could say "cah", none could say "truck."	2

in 1986, peter davies was on holiday in kenya after graduating from louisiana state university .  on a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. the elephant seemed distressed, so peter approached it very carefully. he got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. as carefully and as gently as he could, peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.  the elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.  twenty years later, peter was walking through the chicago zoo with his teenaged son. as they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where peter and his son cameron were standing. the large bull elephant stared at peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. the elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.  remembering the encounter in 1986, peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. he walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. the elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.  probably wasn't the same elephant.	1

a man sits next to a mule with a sign that says “$10 to make my mule laugh. make him laugh and you win $100. a stranger in town sits on a park bench watches for a while. he sees a line of people try all kinds of crazy things to make the mule laugh. after a bit he walks over and talks to the mules owner. he finds out no one has ever made the mule laugh. he watches a bit longer before he pulls out $10 and hands it over to the owner. the stranger walks over to the mule, whispers in his ear and then stands back. the mule looks a him and then starts to chuckle. the chuckle turns into a laugh and soon the mule is rolling on the ground kicking his legs in his the air.   the owner walks over, hands the stranger $100 and asks, “what’d you say to my mule mister?”  the stranger similes, pockets the money, shakes his head and says he can’t tell what he said before he leaves.   a year later the stranger returns and sees the same man, the same mule, but a different sign. this time the sign says “$20 to make my mule cry. make him cry and you win $200.”  again he watches for a while and sees people try all sorts of strange things. after a bit he goes over to the owner again. the owner gives him a wary look but takes his $20. he tells the stranger he can do anything he wants but he can’t physically harm the mule in any way. the stranger asks if he can take the mule behind a nearby shed and promises not to harm the mule. with some reluctance the owner agrees. when the mule sees the stranger, he starts to chuckle and continues to do so as he’s led behind the shed. when he comes back a minute later the stranger is leading a sobbing mule.   the owner walks over wide eyed holding $200. this time the owner refuses to hand over the money until the stranger reveals how he made the mule cry. the stranger hesitates for a few seconds and then shrugs and smiles. “last year i told your mule i had a bigger cock than he did. he thought that was funny. this time i proved it to him.”  note: a high schooler told me this joke when i was in jr high. he was my instant hero.	3

this joke was stolen from ronald reagan. and it’s good. one day, an order went out to the police departments in the soviet union that anyone caught speeding, anyone, no matter who, gets a ticket. one day, the general secretary was late leaving his country home to get to moscow. he runs up to his limousine and tells the driver to get in the back, and that they’ll never make it in time, so he’ll drive. and down the road they went. later on, he flew by two motorcycle cops, and one took off after him. several minutes go by, and the cop returns to his partner. his partner says, “well, did you give em’ a ticket?” “no, i didn’t” he replies reluctantly. “well why not?!” he said, “we’re told to give anyone a ticket, no matter who it is” “oh no no, this one was too important.” he replied. “what do you mean ‘too important’?!” said his partner. he then says “well... i couldn’t recognize him... but his driver was the general secretary!”	1

navy pilot vs marine pilot by the time a navy pilot pulled into a little town, every hotel room was taken. "you've got to have a room somewhere," he pleaded. "or just a bed, i don't care where." "well, i do have a double room with one occupant, a marine pilot," admitted the manager, "and he might be glad to split the cost. but to tell you the truth, he snores so loudly that people in adjoining rooms have complained in the past. i'm not sure it'd be worth it to you."   "no problem," the tired navy pilot assured him. "i'll take it." the next morning the navy pilot came down to breakfast bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. "how'd you sleep?" asked the manager. "never better." the manager was impressed. no problem with the other guy snoring, then?" "nope, i shut him up in no time." said the navy pilot. "how'd you manage that?" asked the manager.   "he was already in bed, snoring away, when i came in the room, i went over, gave him a kiss on the cheek, said, 'goodnight, beautiful,' ...and he sat up all night watching me."	2

a salesman was traveling through the country side, flogging insect repellent.  he came to a farmhouse and tried his pitch on the farmer. “sir, my bug spray is so good you will never be bitten again. i guarantee it.” the farmer was dubious. “young man, i’ll make you a proposition. i’ll tie you out in my cornfield buck naked, covered with that bug spray. if there is not a single bite on you come morning, i’ll buy a whole case from you. and get everyone in the county to buy a case… we will make you rich.” the salesman was delighted. they went to the field and he stripped. the farmer sprayed him thoroughly with the bug spray and tied him to a stake. back to the house went the farmer. the next morning, the farmer and his family trooped out to the cornfield. sure enough, the salesman was there, hanging in his bonds, not a single bite on him. yet he was a total wreck! pale, ghastly, haggard, and drawn, but not one bite on him. the farmer was perplexed. “son,” he said, “now, you don’t have a bite on you but you look like hell! what the devil happened?” the salesman looked up through bloodshot eyes and croaked,  "doesn't that calf have a mother?"	2

the husband leans over and asks his wife.. "do you remember the first time we had sex together over fifty years ago? we went behind the village tavern where you leaned against the back fence and i made love to you."  yes, she says, "i remember it well."  ok, he says, "how about taking a stroll around there again and we can do it for old time's sake?"  "oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!"  a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.  the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..  then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.  the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.  after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.  the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.  so, as the couple passes, he says to them, "excuse me, but that was something else. you must've had a fantastic sex life together. is there some sort of secret to this?"  shaking, the old man is barely able to reply,  "fifty years ago that wasn't an electric fence."	3

this is the dirty joke my 85yo grandad told to our whole family by memory a male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  the male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. he said to the female whale, "lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink." they tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.   soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, "let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore." at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. "look," she said, "i went along with the blow job, but i absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."	3

"well," replies the black guy and continues, "that's just training. from an early age we tie a brick to our dick on a string, 2-3 hours a day. that's our secret". both leave the urinal in silence. as luck would have it, the two of them meet again in the same place around a month later. the black to the white: "hey, are you not the guy from back then?". he replies: "yes, it's me". then the black man aks: "how is it going?" the white answers: "it works quite well, i guess.  i would say that i have already achieved partial success." the black: "what do you mean by partial success?" the white one: "well, my dick is not longer yet, but it's already black".	2

once there was an inflatable boy who lived in an inflatable house with his inflatable parents. every morning when the inflatable alarm rang, he would leap out of his inflatable bed and into the inflatable shower, then when he was dressed he would go and sit at the inflatable table in the kitchen to eat his inflatable breakfast, and then run off and catch the inflatable bus to his inflatable school.  when he got home from the inflatable school he would play with the inflatable dog, do his inflatable homework and watch the inflatable tv until bedtime -- and everything in his inflatable world seemed just fine.  then one day a fit of teenage angst came over him and he took a knife from the inflatable kitchen drawer and hid it in his inflatable schoolbag, and at school, when the inflatable bell rang for break he ran out of the classroom and began slashing and stabbing at the walls of the inflatable school!  as the other inflatable children and the inflatable teachers ran around panicking, the inflatable schoolboy looked up to see his inflatable headmaster striding sternly towards him. so the inflatable schoolboy impulsively stabbed the inflatable headmaster and then, seeing the inflatable headmaster collapsing, he was overcome with horror and turned the knife on himself, and the world turned black...  he awoke to find himself in an inflatable bed at the inflatable hospital, with a patch where he had stabbed himself and a machine by the bed gently re-inflating him through a narrow hose. and in the inflatable bed next to him was his inflatable headmaster, receiving the same treatments; and the inflatable headmaster shook his inflatable head sadly and said:  "boy... you've let me down, you've let the school down, but worst of all, you've let yourself down."	1

a newlywed farmer and his wife were visited by her mother, who immediately demanded an inspection of the place. while they were walking through the barn, the farmer's mule suddenly reared up and kicked the mother-in-law, unfortunately killing her instantly.  at the funeral service, the farmer stood near the casket and greeted folks as they walked by. the pastor noticed that whenever a woman would whisper something to the farmer, he would nod his head "yes" and say something. whenever a man walked by and whispered to the farmer, he would shake his head "no" and mumble a reply.     curious, the pastor later asked the farmer what that was all about. the farmer replied, "the women would say, 'what a terrible tragedy,' and i would nod my head and say, 'yes, it was.' the men would ask, 'you wanna sell that mule?' and i would shake my head and say, 'can't. it's all booked up for a year.'"	2

spaghetti for several years, a man was having an affair with an italian woman. one night, she confided in him that she was pregnant. not wanting to ruin his reputation or his marriage, he paid her a large sum of money if she would go to italy to secretly have the child. if she stayed in italy to raise the child, he would also provide child support until the child turned 18.   she agreed, but asked how he would know when the baby was born. to keep it discrete, he told her to simply mail him a post card, and write 'spaghetti' on the back. he would then arrange for the child support payments to begin.  one day, about 9 months later, he came home to his confused wife. 'honey', she said, 'you received a very strange post card today'.  'oh, really? let me see...', he said. the wife gave it to him and watched as her husband read the card, turned white, and fainted. on the card was written: 'spaghetti, spaghetti, spaghetti. two with meatballs, one without. send extra sauce.'	3

"why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  so the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *my daughter is inviting all of her friends, and i'll look bad if i don't put together a good cake*, he thought. then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide free cake to its customers.  *how quaint,* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  he was met by a buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "hello," the father asked, "i would like to buy a cake."  "of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  the father thought this to be weird, but wanting to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  the day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. all of the guests were in awe, and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  the monk became the guest of honor and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "why do you do this for free? you should take money for your services!"  the monk smiled and said, "i do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."	3

'how is she ever going to know that you want her to hitch the trailer to your pickup truck and drive out here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her just the word 'comfortable?'      the brunette explains, 'my sister's blonde. the word's big. she'll read it very slowly ... com-for-da-bull.'	3

one day, pete complained to his friend, “my head really hurts. i guess i should see a doctor.” his friend said, “don’t do that. there’s a computer at the drug store that can diagnose anything quicker and cheaper than a doctor. simply tell it the problem, put in a sample of your urine, and the computer will diagnose it and tell you what you can do about the issue you’re having. it only costs $20.00.”  pete figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $20.00.  the computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. after a brief pause, out popped a small slip of paper which read:  you have migraines. you need to take better care of yourself. get daily rest, drink a lot and avoid bright lights, stress, and strain. see me again in 2 weeks.  during the next 2 weeks, while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this could be fooled. he decided to give it a try. he mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog, and urine samples from his wife and daughter. to top it off, he even added some oil from his car.  he went back to the drug store, located the computer, poured in the sample and deposited the $20.00, again stating he had a bad headache. he waited curiously to see what the computer will say about the odd mix. the machine again made the usual noises, flashed lights, and printed out the following analysis:  your tap water has too much waste in it.  your dog has ringworms.  your teenage daughter is pregnant.  your wife has had 5 different lovers in the past six months.  also, your car needs a new radiator.  and you wonder why you have a headache?	3

a guy was waiting at the bus stop for the bus, when a beautifull girl shows up... she has the most beautiful tits that the has ever seen, and immediatly he goes crazy...  after 5 minutes looking at her, he can't resist and go talk to her:  \\- i am really sorry... but i am in love with your beautiful breasts... if i give you $200,000 would you let me bite your boobs?  \\- what? are you insane? no!  \\- ok... i am really sorry.  after 5 more minutes, he tries again:  \\- look... if i give you $1.000,00, would you let me bite your boobs, then?  \\- $1.000,00? i mean... no! no way.  \\- alright... for $10.000,00, would you let me give a little bite on your boobs?  \\- $10.000,00! well... just a little bite won't kill me, i guess... here, follow me.  then they both go to a more empty place, and she takes off her shirt. he starts to touch'em gently, licks it, play with them for about 5 mins... she loses her patient and asks:  \\- listen... won't you bite them?  \\- what? no, it is too expensive!	2

"cocaine from bolivia."  "that's some good stuff son, come in."  at the next knock jesus asks, "who is it?"  "it's john."  jesus opens the door.  "what did you bring john?"  "crack from new york."  "okay we are not touching that, but heyh, come in."  someone starts pounding on the door.  "who is it?"  "it's judas!"  jesus opens the door.  "what did you bring judas?"

a sensitive man a woman meets a man in a bar. they talk; they connect; they end up leaving together..   they get back to his place, and as he shows her around his apartment. she notices that one wall of his bedroom is completely filled with soft, sweet, cuddly teddy bears.    there are three shelves in the bedroom, with hundreds and hundreds of cute, cuddly teddy bears carefully placed in rows, covering the entire wall!    it was obvious that he had taken                     quite some time to lovingly arrange them and she was immediately touched by the amount of thought he had put into organizing the display.   there were small bears all along the bottom shelf, medium-sized bears covering the length of the middle shelf, and huge, enormous bears running                     all the way along the top shelf.   she found it strange for an obviously masculine guy to have such a large collection of                   teddy bears,   she is quite impressed by his sensitive side. but doesn't mention this to him. they share a bottle of wine and continue talking and, after awhile, she finds herself thinking, 'oh my god! maybe, this guy could be the one! maybe he could be the future father of my children?'     she turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips he responds warmly they continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom   where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love. she is so overwhelmed that she responds with more passion,  more creativity, more heat than she has ever known.    after an intense, explosive night of raw passion with this sensitive guy,    they are lying there together in the afterglow. the woman rolls over, gently strokes his chest and asks coyly,    'well, how was it?'    the guy gently smiles at her,   strokes her cheek,   looks deeply into her eyes,  and says:   'help yourself to any prize from the middle shelf.'	3

a father whale and his son are swimming when the son whale asks his father "where did i come from." the father whale replies "from my penis son." the son rolls his eyes and says "thanks dad" to which the father whale replies "you're whale cum son, you're whale cum."    at which point, the father whale was stricken by a long thin object which penetrated him with ease. he saw that it appeared to come from some large, shape floating at the surface.  another harpoon struck the father as his son gazed at him with terror and disbelief, he watched the life drain from his eyes.  multiple years later, a male whale and a female whale were swimming off the coast of japan when they noticed a whaling ship.  the male whale recognized it as the same ship that had harpooned his father many years earlier. he said to the female whale, "lets both swim under the ship and blow out of our air holes at the same time and it should cause the ship to turn over and sink." they tried it and sure enough, the ship turned over and quickly sank.   soon however, the whales realized the sailors had jumped overboard and were swimming to the safety of shore. the male was enraged that they were going to get away and told the female, "let's swim after them and gobble them up before they reach the shore." at this point, he realized the female was becoming reluctant to follow him. "look," she said, "i went along with the blow job, but i absolutely refuse to swallow the seamen."	1

american/russian dog fight  the americans and russians at the height of the arms race realized that if they continued in the usual manner they were going to blow up the whole world. one day they sat down and decided to settle the whole dispute with one dog fight. they would have five years to breed the best fighting dog in the world and whichever side's dog won would be entitled to dominate the world. the russians found the biggest meanest doberman and rottweiler female dogs in the world and bred them with the biggest meanest siberian wolves. they selected only the biggest and strongest puppy from each litter, removed his siblings, which gave him all the milk. after five years they came up with the biggest meanest dog the world had ever seen. its cage needed steel bars that were five inches thick and nobody could get near it. when the day came for the dog fight, the americans showed up with a strange animal. it was a nine foot long dachshund. everyone felt sorry for the americans because they knew there was no way that this dog could possibly last 10 seconds with the russian dog. when the cages were opened up, the dachshund came out of it's cage and slowly waddled over towards the russian dog. the russian dog snarled and leaped out of it's cage and charged the american dachshund. but, when it got close enough to bite the dachshund's neck, the dachshund opened it's mouth and consumed the russian dog in one bite. there was nothing left at all of the russian dog. the russians came up to the americans shaking their heads in disbelief. "we don't understand how this could have happened. we had our best people working for five years with the meanest doberman and rottweiler female dogs in the world and the biggest meanest siberian wolves." "that's nothing", an american replied. "do you know how hard it is to make an alligator look like a dachshund.	3
