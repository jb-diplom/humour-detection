one rainy, windy night, a man was walking home alone, down a dark, deserted street that ran right by the local cemetery. as he passed the gates, he heard a bump in the darkness behind him. not daring to look back, he quickened his pace. but, the bumping noise continued behind him.he stopped and turned to see what it was. coming down the road behind him was a coffin, standing on end, bumping from side to side -  bump,  bump,  bump.  the man, terrified for his life, turned and started running. behind him, the coffin came faster  bump,  bump,  bump!  ahead of him, there was a branch that had fallen from a tree. he reached down and grabbed it as he ran by. still running, he turned and threw it over his shoulder at the coffin - but it just splintered when it hit the coffin and the coffin continued coming faster  bumpity bump,  bumpity bump,  bumpity bump!  the man turned the corner onto his street and ran through his front gate, the coffin right behind him. his splitting axe was resting against his woodpile so he snagged it, turned, and gave a mighty two-handed throw sending it end over end right at the coffin.  smash! -  the axe shattered on the unnaturally strong wood of the coffin and it continued after him.the man dashed in his house, but the coffin crashed through the front door. the man ran upstairs and grabbed his shotgun off the wall display.  he blasted the coffin with both barrels, but the shot bounced harmlessly off the coffin as it continued up the stairs  bump,  clomp,  bump,  clomp!  the man, desperate and scared to death, jumped into the bathroom and locked the door - knowing it would do no good. the coffin banged against the door, once ..., twice ..., and on the third time, the door exploded and the coffin came forward.  in desperation the man reached out his hand and grabbed whatever he could. all that was there was a bottle of cough syrup so he threw it at the coffin.  the bottle shattered, cough syrup covered the coffin from top to bottom  and the coffin stopped...	1

one sunday morning in the middle of a blizzard one sunday morning in february, the young new pastor slowly made his way to the rural church in the middle of a blizzard, arriving with just five minutes to spare. he walked in, turned on the lights and looked around. no one else was there.    as he was about to turn everything off and go back home, an old farmer walked in, covered in snow.   the pastor said, "oh hello joe. looks like nobody else could make it. i guess we won't have a service today."  the old farmer looked at him for a few seconds and said: "well, reverend, i know i am just an old farmer, but i can tell you this: if i take a load of hay out to the field to feed my cattle and only one cow shows up, i still feed it."   the pastor, embarrassed, said "of course. you are right. i will go get ready."   so the pastor started the service and, being inspired by the farmer's faith and dedication, preached fervently for a full hour.   when the service was over the pastor went over to the farmer and said "so joe... i hope you enjoyed today's sermon."  the old farmer looked at him, shook his head and said "reverend, if i go out to feed the cattle and only one cow shows up, i still feed it, but i don't give it the whole fucking load."	1

"brad, are you up yet?" asks mike. brad sleepily answers, "yeah, but i'm only now starting my coffee." "brad, open the newspaper to page 31." "why, what's in the paper?" "brad, get the paper and open it to page 31 now!" "ok, ok, i've got the paper here, so what's in page 31?" "brad, open the paper to page 31 already!" "all right, don't be such a pain so early in the morning already. so, what's on page 31 that's so important?" "brad, look at the bottom of column 4." "why? what's that story on?" "brad, read the story on the bottom of the column already!" "ok, ok, i'll start reading the column if you stop yelling in my ear!" the paper rustles for a few seconds, then a long silent pause ensues... finally, brad comes on the line quietly and fearfully asks, "so mike, where are you calling me from right now?"	1

"thank you for freeing me. for this, you can have one wish." so the man thinks for a bit and shouts, "i want a million ducks!" and as soon as he said it, money fell from the sky, hundreds and thousands of cash scattered everywhere. so the man collects all the cash and walks back into the bar to return the lamp. the bartender, who witnessed the whole event asks, "wow, how did you know that the genie was hard of hearing?"

a wealthy, but stingy father was trying to put a birthday party together for his 16 y/o daughter.  he wanted the party to be extravagant but wanted to spend as little money as possible. he had finished all of the other decorations, and he was left to work on the cake.  "why not get it ordered from an upscale bakery?" his wife said.  so the father visited a ton of different bakeries and did research, but found the prices to be too high.  *"*my daughter is inviting all of her friends, and i'll look bad if i don't put together a good cake*"*, he thought. then, he stumbled upon a shop that opened once a year to provide a free cake to its customers.  "how quaint*",* the father thought, but desperate, he walked inside to see if they could provide a cake for his daughter's birthday.  he was met by a buddhist monk chanting and lighting incense.  "hello," the father asked, "i would like to buy a cake."  "of course," the monk replied, "just draw a picture of the cake you would like on the notepad on the desk."  the father thought this to be weird, but want to save as much money as possible, he gave him the address and told him to come in the backdoor, just in case the cake was bad.  the day of the party arrived and the monk visited the house with the most extravagant cake the family had ever seen. all of the guests were in awe and whispered to each other about how much the cake could have cost.  the monk became the guest of honour and at the end of the party, the father approached the monk and asked,  "why do you do this for free? you should take money for your services!"  the monk smiled and said, "i do this for free because a cake day is the best way to earn karma."	1

little girl lands position as construction boss.      **a young family moved into a house next to a vacant lot. one day, a construction crew turned up to start building a house on the empty lot.**     **the young family’s 5-year-old daughter naturally took an interest in all the activity going on next door and spent much of each day observing the workers. eventually the construction crew, all of them “gems-in-the-rough” more or less, had adopted her as a kind of project mascot.**     **they chatted with her, let her sit with them while they had coffee and lunch breaks, and gave her little jobs to do here and there to make her feel important. at the end of the first week, they even presented her with a pay envelope containing ten dollars.**     **the little girl took this home to her mother who suggested that she take her ten dollars “pay” she’d received to the bank the next day to start a savings account. when the girl and her mom got to the bank, the teller was equally impressed and asked the little girl how she had come by her very own paycheck at such a young age.**     **the little girl proudly replied: “i worked last week with a real construction crew building the new house next door to us.”**     **“oh my goodness gracious,” said the teller, “and will you be working on the house again this week, too?”**     **the little girl replied, “i will if those lazy assholes from lowe’s ever deliver the fucking sheetrock.”**	1

"the catholic church? no clue what you mean. but wait, i go and ask the boss."  peter goes to god and reports: "lord, there is someone at the gate who calls himself pope. he says he is your deputy on earth and mentioned a catholic church." "never heard of it" is god's response "but wait, i will ask my son! jesus!" he called.  jesus came running to his father and god and peter explained the situation. "i don't believe it!" jesus gasped "remember the small fishing club i founded 2000 years ago? this thing is still around!"	1

german spies during world war two. so my dad told me it a few years back and i still like it. that's how it goes:  during world war ii  the germans trained these super duper mega ultra spies. they could speak fluent english, fluent french and fluent russian.  knew the history of every said enemy country.  knew how to behave in every said country. if you'd see one on the street you'd never guess they're german.   on the first mission of these two spies, the germans send them right into the centre parts of london. they give them british passports and ids all to fit in as smoothly as possible.  after spending a couple days in london, they wake up one morning and decide to go for a walk on the streets to check for enemy intelligence via newspaper, rumors on the street etcetera. while walking down the street they see a pub on their left side. one german looks at the other and says  "you know, i always wanted to try the martini of these english pigs". they cross the road and the walk inside the pub, come up to the bartender and ask for martini. the bartender looks at them and asks "martini dry"? the germans, confused, look at each other, and reply:  "nein. zwei."	1

george pell: cardinal to learn outcome of abuse conviction appeal https://t.co/wzrcwjsaxq	0
in the mormon church there is a family that has recently been baptized. after a month of being new members the bishop calls them in separately to see how they are doing. during an interview with the father, the bishop asks, “will you give a talk next sunday in church?” the new convert replies, “sure, but what would you like me to give my talk on?” “on anything you feel that would be beneficial to the congregation, like past experiences and such that have changed your life in a positive way.” so he goes home and immediately starts thinking about what he would like to speak on. one night as he is working on his talk his wife comes up to him and asks, “so honey, what are you going to give your talk on?” “well, after much thought, i have decided to give a talk on water skiing.” “water skiing! what? this is church we are talking about; you can’t give a talk on water skiing. it would be indecent!” “the bishop said i can give a talk on anything i wanted to and i want to give it on water skiing!” her husband is known to be a big joker so she shrugs it off not worrying about it for the time being. as sunday comes though, she starts to get nervous and can’t take it any longer. when they arrive at the church parking lot she says to him, “alright sweetheart, the jokes over. what are you really going to give your talk on?” “i was being serious; i really am going to give a talk on water skiing!” his wife responds, “well, if that’s the way you are going to be, me and the kids do not want to be embarrassed by this, so we will wait out here in the car while you give your talk!” “fine, be that way!” he replies. so he goes into church while his family stays in the car. as he sits down and waits for his turn to speak, he thinks it over and realizes that his wife is probably right. talking about water skiing in church? what was i thinking?!! so he goes to his back up plan. he gives a talk on adultery. after he gives his talk and the session ends he goes back to the parking lot to get his wife and kids and to apologize for the way he acted. but before he could say anything to them the bishop comes up and turns to his wife and remarks, “your husband gave one of the best talks in church. i mean there wasn’t even a dry eye in the room after he finished!” the wife stared at the bishop incredulously and said,  “you must be joking! he’s only done it twice. once with my mother and once with my sister and couldn’t get up either time!!”	1

the male owner of a business is interviewing a young woman just about to graduate from an all-women’s college. she was very excited about her interview but wanted to make sure that this business was progressive when it came to women in the workplace. it seemed like every company she interviewed at were run by horrible misogynists. when it came to the part of the interview when he asked her if she had any questions, it was her turn to pounce.  “i’ve researched this and found out that that your workforce is only 31% women. do you have progressive hiring practices to make that ratio closer to the average population?” she asks.  “i’m sorry but no. look, i know you’re from one of those ‘activist’ schools where they have told you all about inequality, but the simple truth is that i’m a businessman and when i hire someone, i’m going to pick the best person for the job. i don’t care if they’re a man or a woman. i just want the best. it would be crazy for me to pick someone who’s less qualified just because they’re a woman.”  she was a little disappointed by the answer, but she certainly understood his point. she went on, “well ok, but i also noticed that your senior staff is only 9% women. do you have progressive promotion practices to make that ratio closer to at least your average workforce?”  “i’m sorry but no. again, i’m always trying to optimize my company and the simple truth is that when i promote someone, i’m going to pick the best person for the job. i don’t care if they’re a man or a woman. i just want the best. it would be crazy for me to pick someone who’s less qualified just because they’re a woman.”  again, she was disappointed but decided to get it one more try. “all right, but what if you came across two perfectly equally qualified people in every respect, but one was a man and the other one was a woman. which one would you hire?”  “oh, well in that case,” said the man, “i would always hire the women. every single time. i’m a smart businessman and in that case the woman is always the better choice!”  she was very excited to hear that response. she got offered a job and gladly accepted.  six months into the job, she ran across the owner at work. since he was the owner and she was a new-hire they didn’t cross paths very often. still, he was very cordial when they crossed paths and he asked her how things were going.  “there’s a lot to learn, but so far i like it. and i like that this is a company that puts women first. when i first interviewed, i almost didn’t want to work here. i thought you were like all those other misogynists that run companies out there. it was so close. it was only after you answered my question about who you would hire between two equally qualified candidates that i know i had landed in the right place!”  “oh yes, i remember. i told you, with me it’s all about optimization. why would i want to hire a man who’s equally qualified as a woman when i can pay her so much less?”	1

a woman was in bed with her lover when she heard her husband's keys in the door. "stay where you are", she said. "he would be so drunk that he would hardly notice". the husband lurched in the bed and within a few minutes, slept.  a few minutes later the woman, (unsatisfied), asked her lover to continue.   the man was too scared so the woman said, "he is so messed up i'll pull out one of his butt hairs and he won't move a bit".  so she did and he didn't move at all. they did it.  a couple of hours later, she repeats the process - he is still passed out - they repeat the pairing.  then just before dawn the wife wants one more ride. so she reaches over and plucks a third ass hair! whereupon the husband looks at the lover  and says,  "i don't mind you screwing my wife but do you have to keep score on my ass??	1

call him maestro... or else many years ago there was an orchestra in omaha whose conductor was notoriously ill tempered. he would fly off the handle at the smallest mistake, yet he would never offer any constructive criticism. he thought he was the greatest, and demanded to be called maestro. but sometimes, he'd give the wrong gestures, and still be angry that the orchestra didn't sound perfect. once, he yelled at a cymbalist, saying "if you don't get it right on opening night, i'll end you!"  sure enough on opening night, the maestro gives the wrong gesture and the cymbalist plays at the wrong time. furious, the maestro pulls out a gun and shoots the guy. the orchestra and the audience are horrified; emergency services and the police are called, and the percussionist is unfortunately pronounced dead at the scene.  the maestro is arrested, taken to jail and put on trial. he is obviously declared guilty and, as was the law in nebraska at the time, sentenced to death by electric chair.  years later, he is finally put to death and his orchestra is in attendance, to see justice carried out.  the warden asks if he has any last words, and he says "that cymbalist had it coming".    enraged at the maestro's unrepentant behaviour in front of the surviving witnesses, and breaking protocol, the warden unceremoniously flips the switch. the chair fizzles, but nothing happens. the warden calls a technician over to check the chair, but no faults are found with the circuitry. so he says to the maestro "it seems you've been given another chance, for some reason. any last words?"  "that whole orchestra was always a bunch of hacks! i never could get music out of them."  the warden shakes his head at this impossible man, and flips the switch again. the chair fizzles, but nothing happens again.  "it looks like we're going to have to use lethal injection, but that requires another appeal process. so it looks like you've been given another chance. beats me why this keeps happening to someone like you."  the maestro reflects on this silently, before finally admitting, "maybe i'm a lousy conductor"	1

this will bring tears to your eyes. as a bagpiper, i play many places. recently i was asked by a funeral director to play at a graveside service for a homeless man. he had no family or friends, so the service was to be at a pauper's cemetery in the kentucky back country.   as i was not familiar with the backwoods, i got lost and, being a typical man, i didn't stop for directions.   i finally arrived an hour late and saw the funeral guy had evidently gone and the hearse was nowhere in sight. there were only the diggers and crew left and they were eating lunch.   i felt bad and apologized to the men for being late. i went to the side of the grave and looked down and the vault lid was already in place. i didn't know what else to do, so i started to play.   the workers put down their lunches and began to gather around. i played out my heart and soul for this man with no family and friends. i played like i've never played before for this homeless man.   and as i played 'amazing grace,' the workers began to weep. they wept, i wept, we all wept together. when i finished i packed up my bagpipes and started for my car. though my head hung low, my heart was full.   as i opened the door to my car, i heard one of the workers say, "i never seen nothin' like that before and i've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years."   apparently i'm still lost....	1

yoda and luke are walking through the swamp. part of their usual training course involves shimmying along a cliff ledge, but today, there’s a long break in the ledge they can’t cross...   “something for this i have.” yoda says. he reaches into his bag and takes out a bunch of regular dinner table forks and a roll of duct tape.  he tapes several forks together to make a bridge and lays it down, allowing the two of them to get across.  when they get back to yoda’s hovel, they find that some creature has chewed a hole in the fence around yoda’s garden.  “something i have for this.” yoda says again. once again, he takes a bunch of forks out of his bag and, using duct tape, tapes them in to patch the hole.  yoda and luke return to yoda’s home, where yoda looks through his bag. he’s used all his forks but one, he discovers.  “that’s ok master." luke says, wanting to be helpful. “i’ll write us a note reminding us to buy more.”  so he writes the note and uses the very last fork to pin it to the bulletin board.  he looks down at yoda expecting pride, but instead finds a look of horror.  “master yoda!” he asks. “what did i do wrong?”  yoda replies sagely, “a jedi uses the forks for no ledge and the fence. never for a tack!”	1

where’s my money pablo finds out the cartel bookkeeper of 20 years, diego, has cheated him out of $10 million. diego is deaf which is why he got the job in the first place. pablo assumed that since diego could not hear anything, he could never testify against pablo or any of the boys.   pablo goes to confront diego about the missing $10 million and takes along his personal minder because he knows sign language.  pablo tells the minder, ‟ask him where the money is!” the minder, using sign language asks, ‟where‘s the money?” diego signs back, ‟i do not know what you are talking about.” the minder tells pablo, ‟he says he doesn‘t know what you are talking about.” pablo pulls out a pistol, puts it to diego’s head and says, ‟ask him again or i‘ll kill him!” the minder signs, ‟he will kill you if you do not tell him.” diego trembles and signs back, ‟ok! you win! the money is in a brown briefcase, buried behind the shed at my cousin jose’s house.” pablo asks the minder, ‟what did he say?” the minder replies, ‟he says go fuck yourself pablo you don‘t have the balls to pull the trigger.”	1

dead crows researchers for the massachusetts turnpike authority found over 200 dead crows near boston and there was concern that they died from avian flu. a bird pathologists examined and confirmed that the crows did not die from avian flu. the cause of death appeared to be vehicular impacts.  during greater analysis, it was noted that from the varying colors of paint on the crows, it was determined that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with trucks and only 2% by cars. several animal behaviorists were hired to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of truck kills versus car kills.  the ornithological behaviorist very quickly found the cause: when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow in a nearby tree to warn of impending danger.  the conclusion was that when cars were coming, the lookout crow would say "cah, cah" none could say "truck.”	1

a little boy in a quaint town was said to be the hairiest person in history. even in a small community, where everyone was aware of and understood his plight, living a normal life was difficult. even though everyone was respectful, the sheer volume of hair and speed at which it grew was a constant hardship. it interfered with the boy's eating, he would overheat quickly during warmer seasons, hygiene was an issue ... there was no shortage of difficulties stemming from this unprecedented hair growth.  the boy's family tried their best to trim the hair down to more manageable lengths, but within the week the hair grew back in entirety, without fail. eventually, they resorted to cutting hair away from the most problematic areas - the mouth, the eyes, etc. it seemed like there was no possibility of ever overcoming the hair.  one day, a man happened upon the community. he was a scholar of sorts, and had traveled the world documenting and researching all the wonders of the world. he only came through with the intention of trading for some food and supplies, but something caught his attention: the hairy boy, of course. the townsfolk thought the scholar meant to gawk at the boy, but he revealed something quite interesting: halfway across the world, the scholar had encountered another boy sharing the affliction *and they had been cured.*  plucking and trimming was ineffective, the scholar explained. the only way to stop the hair was to shave the boy, completely. they would need to work together to beat it, but it *could* be beaten. the scholar had business elsewhere, but promised to return within the week to see the boy's transformation.  over the next several days, everyone in the family took shifts shaving the boy. night and day, somebody was always shaving hair off the boy. unfortunately, the growth was so aggressive that all progress made was undone within the day. it seemed hopeless.  upon the scholar's return, the family accosted him, thinking it was all a cruel joke.  the scholar was confused - he knew the cure worked, he had seen it with his own eyes! he began asking question after question, trying to learn why they were not successful. surely the blades were dull, some of the hairs had been pulled out instead? had they missed a spot?  the family insisted they had done just as he said, they had worked for days on end to no avail. there was simply no way for their family to outpace the growth. no matter for feverishly they attacked the hair, it grew faster than they could shave it. at one point they had even tried the entire family shaving different sections of growth simultaneously. nothing, no improvement.  the scholar chuckled to himself, realizing the problem. the family, even cooperating, was not enough to combat the hair. everyone in town would need to work together to cure the boy. as the scholar had learned with the other case, it would take the village to raze the child.	1

two aliens landed in the new mexico desert near a gas station that had been closed for the night.    they approached one of the gas pumps and the younger of the two aliens addressed it.  "greetings, earthling. we come in peace. take us to your leader."  the gas pump (of course) didn't respond.  the younger alien started to get mad at the lack of response and the older one said, "i wouldn't do that if i were you."  the younger alien ignored the warning and repeated the greeting.  again, there was no response.  annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, "greetings, earthling. we come in peace. do not ignore us in this way! take us to your leader, or i will fire."  the older alien again warned his comrade, "you don't want to do that. you really don't want to make him mad!"  "rubbish," replied the younger alien.  he aimed his weapon at the pump and fired.  there was a huge explosion.  a massive fireball roared outwards and towards them and blew the younger alien off his feet and deposited him in a burnt and crumpled mess 200 yards away in a cactus patch.  thirty-five earth minutes later, when he finally regained consciousness, refocused his three eyes and straightened his bent antenna, he looked dazedly up at the wiser one, who was standing over him, slowly shaking his big green head.  "what a ferocious creature," said the young fried one. "it damn near killed us! how did you know it was so dangerous?"  the older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler onto the crispy, peeling flesh and shared some knowledge.  "if there's one thing i've learned during my travels through the galaxy," said the wise old alien. "when a guy has a penis he can wrap around himself twice and then stick it in his ear, you don't mess with him."	1

the aduit    the irs decided to audit grandpa, and summoned him to the irs office. the irs auditor was not surprised when grandpa showed up with his attorney.  the auditor said, “well, sir, you have an extravagant lifestyle and no full-time employment, which you explain by saying that you win money gambling. i’m not sure the irs finds that believable.”  “i’m a great gambler, and i can prove it,” says grandpa. “how about a demonstration?”  the auditor thinks for a moment and says, “ok. go ahead.”   grandpa says, “i’ll bet you a thousand dollars that i can bite my own eye.”  the auditor thinks a moment and says, “it’s a bet.”   grandpa removes his glass eye and bites it. the auditor’s jaw drops.  grandpa says, “now, i’ll bet you two thousand dollars that i can bite my other eye.”  the auditor can tell grandpa isn’t blind, so he takes the bet.   grandpa removes his dentures and bites his good eye. the stunned auditor now realizes he has wagered and lost three grand, with grandpa’s attorney as a witness. he starts to get nervous.  “want to go double or nothing?” grandpa asks. “i’ll bet you six thousand dollars that i can stand on one side of your desk, and pee into that wastebasket on the other side, and never get a drop anywhere in between.”  the auditor, twice burned, is cautious now, but he looks carefully and decides there’s no way this old guy could possibly manage that stunt, so he agrees again.  grandpa stands beside the desk and unzips his pants, but although he strains mightily, he can’t make the stream reach the wastebasket on the other side, so he pretty much urinates all over the auditor’s desk.  the auditor leaps with joy, realizing that he has just turned a major loss into a huge win. but grandpa’s attorney moans and puts his head in his hands.  “are you ok?” the auditor asks.   “not really,” says the attorney. “this morning, when grandpa told me he’d been summoned for an audit, he bet me twenty-five thousand dollars that he could come in here and pee all over your desk and that you’d be happy about it.”	1

a few very important lessons you will learn only after you have kids a "king style" water bed contains enough water to turn a 200 sq m apartment into a 12 cm deep lake.  the voice of a 4 year old can deafen 200 normally talking adults in a crowded restaurant.   if you tie a dog leash to a room fan, the motor of the latter is not powerful enough to lift 23 kg youngster in a superman costume into the air. however, it is powerful enough to evenly cover the walls of a 7x7m room with paint from the jar in the hands of the "superman".  when the fan is turned on, baseballs should not be thrown at it.  the window glass, even double-glazed, is not an obstacle for a baseball hit by a fan blade.  if from the bathroom comes the noise of opening the toilet cabinet with your cosmetics, then the sound of glass and then a child's voice "oooops, but i ....", it's already too late.  breaks fluid mixed with chlorine-containing detergent, produces smoke. a lot of smoke.  a 4 year old can start fire with two stones, no matter how much we claim that this only happens in movies.  cement paste and microwave are intolerable.   super cement is super cement. even mixed by a 4 year old, it is forever. even if it is not on a convenient place.  no matter how much fruit jelly you pour into the pool, it does not allow you to walk on water.   pool filters don't like fruit jelly.  glass balls in the fuel tank make a very unpleasant noise while driving.   it is better if you don't try where that smell comes from.  you should always look inside the oven before turning it on. ovens are not particularly well suited to plastic toys.   it takes the fire department 6 minutes to get home.  the spin of the washing machine does not cause dizziness to earthworms.   the spin of the washing machine causes the cat to feel dizzy.   the cat can vomit almost as much as it weighs when dizzy.	1

"excuse me, i left my goat around here, do you know where it went?"  "you're goat's crazy, sir!" one of the boys starts explaining.

what kind of pet shop is this? (nsfw, original)  joe had a dog that he loved dearly. only one problem - no matter what he did, he just could not get the dog to stop soiling the carpet. joe tried everything, read every book on dog training, bought every device on the market. but the dog just refused to be housebroken. finally, he saw an ad for a pet shop that guaranteed it help can train any pet to do just about anything its owner wants. even though it sounded too good to be true, joe gave it a try.  the pet shop was very weird. inside, half the shop was full of bones and dog treats. the other half of the shop was full of dildos, sex toys, and lubricant. it seemed the shop sold both. in the middle, behind the register, was a pleasant-looking man holding an old leather book.  joe asked if the man could help house train his dog.  “sure can,” he said. “see, this here is a magical book. i can rent it out to you. all you do is read the first page aloud to your dog. and then the book gives your dog whatever he wants in order for him to do whatever you’re trying to train him to do. works almost every time. just bring it back here when you’re done. oh, and make sure you have plenty of space.”  joe thanked the man and rented the book. a few days later he comes back with the old leather book in hand.  “well, my dog is house trained now,” said joe. “only problem is my house is filled top to bottom with steaks. thousands and thousands of steaks. what the hell am i supposed to do with all that meat?”  “do the same thing i did,” said the shopkeeper.  “open a business. my dog wanted more treats than he could ever possibly eat. and turns out my cat wanted me to go fuck myself.”	1

"so you're telling me you were speeding...and committed a robbery?"   "yes," the man calmly says. "i have the loot in the back."   the cop begins to get angry. "sir, i'm afraid you have to come with me." the cop reaches in the window to subdue the man.   "don't do that!" the man yells fearfully. "i'm scared you will find the gun in my glove compartment!" the cop pulls his hand out. "wait here," he says.   the cop calls for backup. soon cops, cars, and helicopters are flooding the area. the man is cuffed quickly and taken towards a car. however, before he gets in, a cop walks up to him and says, while gesturing to the cop that pulled him over, "sir, this officer informed us that you had committed a robbery, had stolen loot in the trunk of your car, and had a loaded gun in your glove compartment. however, we found none of these things in your car."   the man replies, "yeah, and i bet that liar said i was speeding too!"	1

poker-playing dog so there's a traveling salesman who loves to play poker. every town he visits, he manages to find a game.  one night he's led to the back of a saloon, and seated among the locals is a german shepherd. the guy is surprised to see a dog at a poker table, but the dog appears to be very well behaved, so the salesman sits down to play.  well, after an hour or so the salesman and the dog are in a showdown. the salesman raises, the dog raises back, the salesman raises again, and the dog calls.  the salesman shows his hand: three queens.  the dog turns over his hand: a flush.  the salesman is so impressed, he isn't even mad that he lost the hand.  "you know," he says to the one of the locals, "not only can that dog play, but he's really pretty good."  "yeah," says the local. "he plays okay, but we usually beat him."  "is that right?" says the salesman.  "yeah," says the local. "whenever he has a good hand, he wags his tail."	1

donald trump sits next to a little girl on air force one donald trump sits next to a little girl on air force one (a daughter of one of his staff). he turns to her and says, 'let's talk- i've heard that flights go quicker if you strike up a conversation with your fellow passenger'.    the little girl, who had just opened her book, closes it slowly and asks trump, 'what would you like to talk about?'.    'oh, i don't know,' says trump, 'how about what changes i should make to “make america great again”?' and smiles.    ‘ok’, she says, ‘that could be an interesting topic. but let me ask you a question first’.  ‘a horse, a cow, and a deer all eat the same stuff - grass. yet a deer excretes little pellets, while a cow turns out a flat patty, and a horse produces clumps of dried grass. why do you suppose that is?’.  trump, visibly surprised by the little girl's intelligence, thinks about it and says, 'hmmm, i have no idea'.    to which the little girl replies, 'do you really feel qualified to change america when you don't know shit?'	1

two thieves see a horse... two thieves see a horse tied to a hitch outside of a tavern in a small rural town. they decide they want want to steal the horse, but they're pretty sure they'll get caught trying to make their escape from the town in the middle of nowhere.    the one thief says to the other: "i have an idea. the people in this town are known to be particularly stupid. i think i know a way we can trick them. take off that saddle and that feed-bag from that horse and put them on me. then you take the horse and let me do the rest. we'll meet up at our safe house outside of town!".   so they do this. the thief with the horse escapes into the night, and the other thief stands at the hitch - wearing a saddle and a feedbag on his face! eventually the local farmer comes out of the tavern...   "where is my horse?!?" the farmer exclaims.      the thief says to him: "i'm right here, don't you recognize me? i used to be a man, just like you. but several years ago i had sex with an evil witch and she cursed me to be a horse for a long time. but the curse is over, now!"   the farmer says "oh my lord! what a tragic tale!  you've been a horse all these years? my horse? can you ever forgive me for all the times i whipped you and worked you so hard for my own ease and comfort?"    the thief thought about it for a second and cagily said: well... i have nothing in this world. if you could give me $50 to help me get  back on my feet again, i would really appreciate it!"    so the old farmer gave him the $50 and the thief went on his way.    several months later the farmer was selling his crops several towns over when he saw his old horse on sale in the market for $50.    to which the farmer replied: "old boy... you really need to learn to stay away from those witches!"	1
a laotian businessman opened a small store in london. he was very quiet and diligent with his bookkeeping. he always made sure to help out his employees when he could, typically hiring other laotians in the area who were struggling to find work.  among these employees was a group of three friends from surrey. although they were a bit rowdy and somewhat lazy, the owner had trouble finding other local applicants, and didn't want to appear partial to laotians.  when it came time for yearly bonuses, none of the three men received a share. the first friend stormed into the owner's office.  "how come we don't get a fuckin' bonus? we work here the same as everyone else!"   the owner sighed and looked back at his papers, replying in broken english "none of you concerned it."   when the worker went back to tell his friends, the second man broke into his office. "the fuck you mean it's none of our concern?! that's our money, same as everyone else!"  again, the owner shook his head, not even looking up. "none of you concerned it."  after telling his friends he got the same broken reply, the third friend had had enough. throwing open the door, he slammed his fist on the desk.  "now look, you old wanker. i don't know how you ran things in laos, but here, when someone does a good job and doesn't get a bonus, it's sure as shit not 'none of our concerned it!'" he shouted, mocking the owner's accent.  the owner sighed, pulled off his glasses and faced the man. "that's all well and good," he said. "however, i worked very hard to get to this point, earning two master's degrees in business and english."  he went back to his papers. "so feel free to look for another job. but trust me when i say that none of you cunts earned it."	1

a man went to his doctor because he had trouble peeing... he complained about how he had to struggle to even get a few drops out. frowning for a brief moment, the doctor assures him that a simple surgery would fix the problem. the next day, the man returns to the hospital for the surgery and the doctor proceeds, the only issue being that the man's testicles would have to be temporarily extracted. the doctor thus removes the testicles and places them on an operating dish but carelessly leaves the door open and his dog comes in, sees the testicles and munches away. horrified, the doctor thinks hard for a moment and then, kills the dog and extracts its testicles and puts them in the man without informing him. he completes the operation, stitches the patient back up and eventually sends him home . the next evening, while at home relaxing. the doctor receives a visitor which happens to be the man operated upon. terrified that the man was coming to confront him, he asks weakly and timidly if everything was fine, to which the man responded with a big grin: "oh never felt better doctor! i pee easily and freely and i owe it all to you!" the doctor let out a huge sigh of relief and was about to offer the man a drink when he was asked: " there's just one question i have for you doc, why is it that whenever i pee, i have to raise a leg?

(barry cryer's wife's favourite joke) a man says to his doctor "i think my wife is going deaf, but i don't want to mention it as it'll be tactless and insensitive.  is there any way i can gauge it, preferably without her knowing?"  the doctor replies "there is, it's quite easy, choose a moment when she has her back to you, say something in a normal voice and if she doesn't answer, move a little nearer and say it again and you'll get an idea about her hearing"  so when he comes home from work, his wife is standing with her back to him in the kitchen.  he says "what's for dinner love?" but gets no answer.  he moves in a little closer "what's for dinner love?" again, no response  moves in again "what's for dinner love?" - nothing.  by now he's right behind her, he says again "what's for dinner love?"  she turns round and says "for the fourth time - chicken!!"

a woman dies and goes to the gates of heaven. when she gets there, she is perplexed and confused to find everyone furiously cracking eggs, dumping flour, and mixing batter.  she turns around and sees an entire section dedicated to decoration, with elaborate concoctions of strawberries, frosting, and tiering at every station.  finally, she seems to recognize someone who appears to be in charge she runs over and asks the man, "what is going on here?"  the strange man replies, "everyone here is doing their best to better their souls." confused at the cryptic answer and curious about the strange man's traditional mongolian garb, the woman asks him to elaborate.  the buddhist monk replies, "my dear, having cake is the best way to gain karma."	1

"calm down," said the devil, "the rules for going upstairs are a lot stricter than people realise - and besides, like i said before, it's really not that bad here."  unconvinced, the guy prepared to object but the devil cut him off.   "let me give you an example," he said, "what's today? monday right? yes monday. do you gamble?"  "i gamble a little bit," said the guy, "i play poker with my friends every now and then and always have a bet on the big horse races."

a 4.0 student was taking an ornithology course in college. the course was known for being very rigorous and challenging, but the student was confident in his abilities. just before the final exam, the professor assigned a hefty amount of homework, due before the day of the exam. the student was able to finish the homework, and was still able to study every chapter in the textbook. except for the last chapter. but, the student was confident that the test wasn’t going to be about bird feet. as the student walks into class on the day of the exam however, he sees that there are 30 or so black plastic bags lined up in the front of the room with bird feet sticking out the bottom. the professor explains that the exam will be to identify all 36 birds under the bag just by their feet and legs. fuming, the student stands up and shouts some very creative profanity at the teacher and starts to storm out of the room. just before he gets to the door, the professor shouts “wait!! what is your name?”  the student throws off his shoes and socks, rolls up his pant legs and shouts “ i don’t know, you tell me!!”	1

neil armstrong and buzz aldrin were training for their moon mission in the moonlike deserts of the western united states, where they had an encounter with an old native american man. the man asked what they were doing in the desert. they replied that they were going to travel to the moon, and explore it soon. when the old man heard that, he fell silent and pondered for a few moments, then asked the astronauts for a favor.  "what do you want?" the astronauts asked.  "well, the people of my tribe believe that sacred spirits live on the moon. i was wondering if you could pass a very important message to them." said the old man.  "well then, what's the message?" said the astronauts.  the man said something in his native language, and asked the astronauts to repeat it over and over again until they had fully memorized it.  "what does it mean?" asked the astronauts.  "oh, i cannot tell you. it's a sacred secret that only our tribe and the moon spirits are allowed to know." the old man mentions.  when the astronauts returned to base, they searched and searched until they had found someone who could speak the old man's native language, then asked him to translate the secret message. when they repeated what they had memorized, the translator began to laugh out loud. when he calmed down, the astronauts asked him what it meant.  the man explained the sentence they had memorized so cautiously said,  "don't believe a single word these white men are telling you. they have come to steal your lands.	1

i heard a story once about an american train driver. he was operating a late night train and feel asleep at the controls. he ended up failing to recognize a stop sign and as a result his train hit a person and killed them immediately. he was tried for manslaughter and sentenced to the electric chair. just before being put in the chair, he was given the choice of final meal and chose a single banana, oddly. his time came and he was placed into the chair, the room vacated and then the switch was thrown.  but... nothing. no sparks, no burning, nothing. they checked the machine and it was working fine, it just seemed not to harm him. the state law meant that, legally, his sentence had been carried out and he was free to go. he walked away a free man, and actually got another job as a train driver.  sadly, almost exactly the same thing happened again. this time his negligence killed two kids playing around on the tracks when again he'd fallen asleep and failed to stop the train in time. hauled before the courts again, he got exactly the same sentence - the electric chair. he was asked again for his final meal, chose two bananas this time, and his sentence was carried out again.  and yet again, he didn't die. in fact, he was entirely unharmed. the state law remained the same, so he was let out again, where - somehow - he got another job with another train company. i guess it was the only job he was trained for (pardon the pun). anyway, this time he did much better and worked hard to stay awake during his late shifts. but sure enough, eventually he slipped back in to old habits and this time killed five people - a family trying to free their dog stuck in the tracks.  once again he faced a jury, once again they found him guilty and a judge sentenced him to the electric chair. this time he asked for 5 bananas, but the guard was wily - he has read about this man and how he always had bananas before his sentence was carried out, and so this time (with a grin, it's said) he brought the train driver 5 apples instead. the guilty man plead and begged for bananas, but the guard claimed it was an honest mistake but too late to change now.  the man was lead for a third time to the electric chair. his head was whetted, his arms strapped in, and the guard eyed him with something between wonder and fear. finally the room was vacated and the switch thrown. surely this time the machine would do its job? with the process finished, the guard ran back into the room, only to find the man still alive and looking entirely healthy. "i don't understand! i set the equipment up myself, i know i did it right, and i know it's all working! and i didn't let you have any bananas! please, you have to tell me - why are you still alive?"  "it's quite simple" replied the train driver. "it has nothing to do with the bananas - i'm just a really, really bad conductor."	1

so a zebra dies and goes to heaven. upon reaching heaven the zebra is met by st. peter who tells him, "zebra, you have led a good life so i will allow you into heaven and as a bonus you may ask any question you can think of." so the zebra ponders for a moment and says "ever since i've been born there is a question that has been bothering me... am i a white zebra with black stripes or a black zebra with white stripes?" st peter looks at the zebra and says "you know, that is a very good question,  i have no idea though i can guarantee god would know the answer." the zebra simply nods and walks into heaven.  a few days later the same zebra is strolling around and notices god. thinking this the perfect opportunity he approaches god and asks "hello god, when i got here st peter told me i could ask any one question and get an answer but he didnt know it. so i'll ask you now, am i a white zebra with black stripes or a black zebra with white stripes?" god looks down and after a few moments of silence a voice booms "you are what you are." perplexed, the zebra simply says thank you and walks away.  later that same day the zebra runs into st peter who stops him to ask "you know, ever since the other day, i haven't been able to get that question out of my head. did you ever find out if you were a white zebra with black stripes or a black zebra with white stripes?" the zebra looks at him and shrugs saying he asked god and repeated the answer of "you are what you are" so st. peter thinks for a second and says "oh! so you are a white zebra with black stripes then!" "if you were a black zebra with white stripes... it would be you is what you is."	1

"isn't it obvious?", she said. "eileen."	1

a man on a business trip in spain decides to take in a bull fight    after  the event, he stops in to the little restaurant next to the venue called  "the matador".  as he checks out the menu trying to decide what he  wants, he sees a waiter bring a dish to another customer.  the  other customer starts eating what appear to be two large meatballs with  great gusto. when the waiter comes to his table, the man asks about the  dish. "oh senor, that is the matador special," replies the waiter in  broken english, "our very best dish!  fresh vegetables, beans and zee  cojones from zee bull. we get the cojones immediately after the bull  fight.  exquisito!"  "okay, that's what i'll have," says the businessman.  "but i am very sorry senor, but that dish is only available once per day."  disappointed, the man chooses another dish and plans to order the matador special the next day.  the  next day the man goes to the bull fight again, and afterwards stops  into the restaurant. just as the waiter is coming to his table, he sees  another waiter bringing the matador special to a customer who got there  before him.  "damn!" he says to himself.  "and tomorrow's my last day  here."  so the next day, he skips  the bull fight, and arrives at the restaurant early.  he is the first  one seated, and proudly proclaims, "i'll have the matador special!"  "an  excellent choice, senor!" responds the waiter.  soon afterwards, the  waiter brings out his dish, but the meat balls are disappointingly  small, and taste rather foul.  "what's with this," the now angry man shouts, "i thought this was your premier dish!"  "i'm very sorry, senor," said the waiter, "but you see, sometimes zee bull, he wins."	1

i proposed to my girlfriend, and my best friend was there. i'd been dating my girlfriend for two years, and decided that i'd finally pop the question. in order to make it seamless, i asked my best mate joe to pass me the ring when i gave him a signal; to add to the element of surprise.   i also asked joe to be my best man. to be honest, i'd known other frends for longer, but i randomly met joe one day. i can't remember how; he came from somewhere or other.   so, one night, in a restaurant, i was eating dinner with my girlfriend. just as we got to desert, i signalled joe to come over. but he was too hasty, and tripped himself up; he fell into one of the tables, and the glass shattered, puncturing his eye.   we decided to postpone the wedding until joe was better, so he didn't miss out. we regularly went to visit him in the hospital; they'd given him a cotton patch that he needed to keep on his eye. he was happy to see us all the time; but eventually i had to set him less and less due to my work obligations. i'd noticed my soon-to-be wife visited him a lot. getting curious, i snuck in one day to see what they got up to.   but instead of finding those two, i found a note on the table. it turned out that my girlfriend had decided to run away with joe; and they didn't tell me where.   so, if it hadn't been for cotton-eyed joe, i'd have been married a long time ago. where did he come from, where did he go? where did he come from, cotton-eyed joe?	1

an american spy is in soviet russia, digging up information on a powerful russian politician. he finds him in a bar, walks in dressed in russian attire, pretending to be russian. everybody in the bar looks at him, but he keeps his cool. he orders a drink and walks to the politician... "greetings, comrade." says the spy, but before he could finish his sentence, the russian says, "i think you are american spy."  the spy is alarmed, but being a skilled, trained, spy, he says, "that is not true! i am the proudest soviet there is! i can sing the anthem more beautifully than any other man in the country!"  he then proceeds to sing the soviet anthem, so melodically and beautifully, that everybody in the bar cheers.  "very good, very good!" says the politician. "but i still think you are spy."  the man continues to keep his cool.  "i am a historian! i can tell you everything about this glorious country!"  he then spends about two hours recounting the revolution, the great patriotic war, about how superior to the russia is in terms of technology compared to america and makes a great argument about how communism is beneficial to society.  "amazing! you are skilled!" says the politician.  the spy smirks.  "but i still think you american spy."  the spy is getting frustrated, but still unfazed.  he replies, "i am good drinker, a true russian! let us drink, and see who can come out top!"  the bar turns its attention to the politician and the spy, who are now in a drinking contest.  the bartender serves drink after drink of vodka.  after about an hour of drinking, the politician nearly passes out, unable to hold as much liquor as the spy, to a resounding cheer amongst the bar.  in the midst of the cheering, the russian politician gets up, smiling, and in a slurred speech, repeats, "you are good, you are good... but i still think you are spy."  the american spy, piss drunk, loses his skill and gives up.  "okay, you got me. i am an american. but what made you think that way, after all this time?"  the russian politician replies, "there aren't many black people in russia."	1

little johnny and his sister come down to breakfast. since they live on a farm, his mother asks if they had done their chores. "not yet," said little johnny.   his mother tells him no breakfast until he does his chores. well, he's a little pissed off, so he goes to feed the chickens, and he kicks a chicken.   he goes to feed the cows, and he kicks a cow. he goes to feed the pigs and he kicks a pig. he goes back in for breakfast and his mother gives him a bowl of dry cereal.   "how come i don't get any eggs and bacon? why don't i have any milk in my cereal?" he asks.   "well," his mother says, "i saw you kick a chicken, so you don't get any eggs for a week. i saw you kick the pig, so you don't get any bacon for a week either. i also saw you kick the cow, so for a week you aren't getting any milk."   just then, his father comes down for breakfast and kicks the cat halfway across the kitchen.   the father sits down in his chair and picks up the paper. “hey dad, mom saw you kick the cat, so you know what that means!”   “what?   “no pussy for a week!” johnny cries laughing.   johnny's father, without looking up at him or his mother, says, “how the fuck is that different from any other week?”   upon hearing all of this, johnny's sister runs out of the house and dashes for the rooster pen, only to get tackled by her father midway.  "nice try", says her dad.	1

a man is sitting in a taxi in newcastle on his way home to sunderland. he realises he recognises the taxi driver- and with great enthusiasm mentions this. "i know you! you picked me and the missus up that time from the train station and took us to the airport! remember?"... the taxi driver, who sees hundreds of different people every day,  smiles politely and replies "maybe.", rather unconvincingly. a typical, though nevertheless unbearable awkwardness follows whereupon the driver says "riddle me this...". the passenger sits up straight and prepares for thinking.  "brothers and sisters has he none, but this man's father is my father's only son. who is the man?"  the passenger thinks long and hard then shrugs. "i give up. who?"  "come on. think about it. brothers and sisters has he none... but this man's father is ***my*** father's only son. who must it be? it can't be anyone else."  slightly aggravated by his own dullness, the passenger says "i dunno. tell me. who is it?"  "why it's me of course. my father's only son is me."  "ahh. good one." replies the passenger and they continued the journey in silence save for his occasionally mumbling "brothers and sisters has he none..." quietly to himself.  he gets back to his house and later that evening announces to his wife that he has got a good riddle for her.  "brothers and sisters has he none, but this man's father is my father's only son. who is the man?"  "how the bloody hell should i know?!" snaps his wife, without a moment's thought.  "well, you're stupid. it's obvious. it's that taxi driver from the train station in newcastle."	1

two university students had a week of exams coming up but decided to party instead. when they got to their exam they decided to tell the professor their car had broken down the night before due to a flat tyre and they needed a bit more time to study.  the professor told them they could have another day to study.  that evening, both of the boys crammed all night until they were sure they knew just about everything. arriving at class the next morning, each boy was told to go to a separate classroom to take the exam. each shrugged and went to different parts of the building. as each sat down they read the first question. "for 5 points, explain the contents of an atom." at this point they both thought this was going to be a piece of cake and answered the question with ease. the test continued.... "for 95 points, tell me which tyre it was."	1

goodbye grandpa     a father put his 3-year old daughter to bed, told her a story and  listened to her prayers which ended by saying, "god bless mommy, god   bless daddy, god bless grandma and good-bye grandpa."    the father asked, 'why did you say good-bye grandpa?'    the little girl said, "i don't know daddy, it just seemed like the thing to do."    the next day grandpa died. the father thought it was a strange coincidence.    a few months later the father put the girl to bed and listened to her prayers which went like this, "god bless mommy, god bless daddy    and good-bye grandma."    the next day the grandmother died.   "holy crap" thought the father, "this kid is in contact with the other side."    several weeks later when the girl was going to bed the dad heard her say, "god bless mommy and good-bye daddy."    he practically went into shock. he couldn't sleep all night and got up at the crack of dawn to go to his office. he was nervous as a cat all day, had lunch and watched the clock. he figured if he could get by until midnight he would be okay. he felt safe in the office, so instead of going home at the end of the day he stayed there,  drinking coffee, looking at his watch and jumping at every sound.    finally, midnight arrived; he breathed a sigh of relief and went home.    when he got home his wife said, "i've never seen you work so late. what's the matter?"    he said, "i don't want to talk about it, i've just spent the worst day of my life."    she said, "you think you had a bad day, you'll never believe what happened to me. this morning my golf pro dropped dead in the middle of my lesson...!"	1

"well, i guess i could use somebody to paint my porch," he said, "how much will you charge  me?" delighted, the girl quickly responded, "how about $50?" the man agreed and told her that the paint brushes and everything she would need was in the garage. the man's wife, hearing the conversation said to her husband, "does she realize that our porch goes all the way around the house?" he responded, "that's a bit cynical, isn't it?" the wife replied, "you're right. i guess i'm starting to believe all those dumb blonde jokes we've reading on facebook  lately." later that day, the blonde teenager came to the door to collect her money. "you're finished already?" the startled husband asked. "yes, she replied, and i even had paint left over, so i gave it two coats." impressed, the man reached into his pocket for the $50.00 and handed it to her along with a $10.00 tip. “and, by the way," the teenager added, "it's not a porch, it's a lexus."	1

[long]husband takes wife to play golf. husband takes his wife to play her first game of golf.   of course, the wife promptly hacked her first shot right through the window of the biggest house adjacent to the course.   the husband shouted , "i warned you to be careful! now we'll have apologize and see how much your lousy drive is going to cost us."   so the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door.   a warm voice said, "come on in." when they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the broken window.   a man reclining on the couch asked, "are you the people that broke my window?"   "uh...yeah, sir. we're sure sorry about that," the husband replied.   "oh, no apology is necessary. actually i want to thank you. you see, i'm a ghost, and i've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. now that you've released me, i'm allowed to grant three wishes. i'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, i'll keep the last one for myself."   "wow, that's great!" the husband said. he pondered a moment and blurted out, "i'd like a million dollars a year for! the rest of my life."  "no problem," said the ghost. "you've got it, it's the least i can do. and i'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!"   "and now you, young lady, what do you want?" the ghost asked. "i'd like to own a gorgeous home complete with servants in every country in the world," she said.   "consider it done," the ghost said. "and your homes will always be safe from fire,burglary and natural disasters!"   "and now," the couple asked in unison, "what's your wish, ghost?"   "well, since i've been trapped in that bottle and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have your wife."   the husband looked at his wife and said, "honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. what do you think?"   she mulled it over for a few moments and said, "you know, you're right. considering our good fortune, i guess i wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?"   "you know i love you sweetheart," said the husband.   "i'd do the same for you!" so the ghost and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon. the ghost was insatiable.  after about three hours of non-stop fun, the ghost  looked directly into her eyes and asked, "how old are you and your husband?"   "why, we're both 35," she responded breathlessly. ghost smile –  -  -  -  -  -  -  -  really???  thirty-five years old and both of you still believe in ghosts???	1

"dear lord!", he suddenly exclaimed, ''where are your testicles?''  the old chief calmly replied, '' vietnam ''.	1

"these men are thieves, rapists and murderers from all over afghanistan." he says, "instead of prison, their punishment is to walk through the desert in nothing but their sandals, receive allah's justice, then return home."  the marine returns to his post and continues to watch these unusual punishments.  after 6 long months of no bed, no clean water, no toilet and witnessing this unusual justice system, his replacement arrives.  "hey, my last post was in korea, how is it here?" asks the replacement. "and what's with this queue of naked guys in the middle of nowhere!?"  "well, i'll be honest with you", replies the marine, "this a shit post, and what you're looking at here is a criminal punch line."	1

a duck gets in trouble for blowing bubbles in the pond. a flock of ducks are in a pond. one day, a particular duck, whom we’ll call quack, found himself upset over seeing another duck blowing bubbles in the pond. so upset, in fact, he decides to take the duck (whose name was waddle) to court.   once in court, the duck is is called to the duck stand. “state your name.”  “my name is waddle.” “waddle, what are you being accused of?” the judge asks the duck. “heck if i knew!” he said. “i was just blowing bubbles in the pond!” the judge looked over his glasses at quack, then back at waddle. “i see no problem with blowing bubbles. you’re free to go,” he says.  the next day, quack sees waddle once again blowing bubbles in the pond, and became very angry. he decides once again (to the judge’s annoyance) to take waddle to court, and they go through the same process. the judge begins to get very angry with quack for continuing to bring waddle in.  finally, after weeks of trouble between waddle and quack, quack takes waddle to court one last time, and this time, he has a plan. “and i assume you’re here because waddle was blowing bubbles in the pond,” the judge says to quack in a dry tone. “yes, your honor. but this time, i brought a witness!”  the judge calls the witness to the stand. “and your name, sir?”  “my name is bubbles.”	1

there was an old man who lived by a forest. as he grew older and older, he started losing his hair, until one day, on his deathbed, he was completely bald. that day, he called his children to a meeting... he said, "look at my hair. it used to be so magnificent, but it's completely gone now. my hair can't be saved. but look outside at the forest. it's such a lovely forest with so many trees, but sooner or later they'll all be cut down and this forest will look as bald as my hair."  "what i want you to do..." the man continued. "is, every time a tree is cut down or dies, plant a new one in my memory. tell your descendants to do the same. it shall be our family's duty to keep this forest strong."  so they did.  each time the forest lost a tree, the children replanted one, and so did their children, and their children after them.  and for centuries, the forest remained as lush and pretty as it once was, all because of one man and his re-seeding heirline.	1

the hunter a man went bear hunting one day.   deep in the mountains, he saw a gigantic drizzly resting.   he took aim, and pulled the trigger.   he went to where he had seen the bear,  but it was nowhere to be found.   he felt a tap on his shoulder, turned and saw the bear  "i am so tired of hunters trying to kill me,  so you have a choice. you blow me, or i kill you."  the hunter did the deed, and the bear left happy.   after a month the hunter returned to get his revenge. he got a larger rifle, and laid in wait for the bear.   after days, he found the bear again, took aim, and shot.   he went to where the bear was, and again it had dissapeared. he felt a tap on his shoulder, turned, and again saw the bear.   "you didnt learn your lesson last time? same options, your choice."  the hunter did the deed again, and left humiliated.   almost a year later he returned. he prepared even more, getting explosives, traps, and an elephant rifle.   he set up all of his traps in a clearing, and made sure to bait it with a feast.   he laid waiting for the bear for a week, barely eating, and not moving. at last, the bear came sniffing around, and stopped in the clearing for the feast.   in one move, he activated the explosives, the traps, and shot the bear. a cloud of smoke and dust flew up and stayed for 10 minutes.   the hunter went to the clearing to finally claim his prize. and he felt the tap on his shoulder. he turned, and there was the bear, completely unharmed with a smirk on his face.   "let's be honest, this isn't about the hunting anymore, is it?"	1

"we have five floors ...... go up floor by floor and once you find what you're looking for you can stay there, it's easy to decide since each floor has a sign telling you what's inside".  **first floor**, the sign reads "all men here are horrible lovers, but they are sensitive and kind". ....... the friends laugh, and without hesitation they move to the next floor.  **second floor**, the sign reads "all the men here are wonderful lovers, but they generally treat their women badly". ...  clearly this wasn't going to do, so they move to the third floor.  **third floor**, the sign reads "all the men here are great lovers and sensitive to their women" ........ this was good, but there was two more floors, so on they went.  **fourth floor**, the sign was perfect it reads "all the men have perfect builds, are sensitive and attentive to their women, are perfect lovers are also single, rich and straight".  the women seemed pleased but they decided that they would rather see what was on the fifth floor before they settle on the fourth.  *when they reached the fifth floor, there is a sign that reads "there are no men here, this floor was only built to prove that there is no way to please a woman"*	1

a young man is wandering, lost, in a forest when he comes upon a small house. he knocks on the door and is greeted by an old chinese man with a long grey beard. “i’m lost,” said the man, “can you put me up for the night?” “certainly,” the chinese man said, “but one condition. if you so much as lay a finger on my daughter i will inflict upon you the three worst chinese tortures known to man.” “ok,” said the man, thinking that the daughter must be pretty old as well, and entered the house. over dinner the daughter came down the stairs. she was young, beautiful and had a fantastic body. she was obviously attracted to the young man as well, as she couldn’t keep her eyes off of him during the meal. remembering the old man’s warning he ignored her and went up to bed alone. during the night he could bear it no longer and snuck into her room for a night of passion. near dawn, he quietly crept back to his room so the old man wouldn’t hear, exhausted but happy. he woke to feel a pressure on his chest. opening his eyes he saw a large rock on his chest with a note on it that read: “chinese torture 1: large rock on chest.”  “well, that’s easy,” he thought. “if that’s the best the old man can do then i don’t have much to worry about.” he picked the boulder up, walked over to the window and threw it out. as he did so, he noticed another note on it that read: “chinese torture 2: rock tied to left testicle.”  in a panic he glanced down and saw the rope that was already getting close to taut. figuring that a few broken bones was better than castration he jumped out of the window after the boulder. as he plummeted toward the ground he saw a large sign on the ground that read: “chinese torture 3: right testicle tied to bed post.”  just sent to me in a last day of work - work email today…	1

"oh you poor creatures!" the lion replied- " can't you see what a hypocrite this monkey is?"  -" how so?"  "last month" the lion continues " this pothead monkey smoked a shit ton of weed and made me walk with him all night !"	1

a man and a chicken walk into a small restaurant a man and a chicken walk into a small restaurant, they sit down, and the waitress takes their order, the man says "i'll have a number 5 with a large coffee", and the chicken says "i will have that as well". when they finished their meal, the man walks up to the counter to pay, and he reaches into his pocket and pulls out exactly how much money he needed with exact change, and he and the chicken went on their way.  the next day, there was a blizzard and the roads were incredibly dangerous, however, the man and the chicken still arrived all the same. this time, the man said "i'll take a number 12 with a medium orange juice" and the chicken said "i will have that as well". when they finished eating, the man went to pay, and once again pulled out exact change, and he and the chicken went on their way.  this continued for about a month, no matter how bad the weather, no matter how many roads were closed, the man and the chicken came in, he ordered, the chicken ordered the same, he paid with exact change out of his pocket, and they left.  eventually, the waitress' curiosity got the best of her, and as the man was paying, she asked, "how are you able to give exact change so easily?" and the man answered with "well, about a year ago, i found an old oil burning lamp, so i rubbed it, and a genie came out and told me i could make three wishes, but i also had to be quite specific, or i could end up with something i didn't want. so i told him, for my first wish, i want to always have however much money i need to buy whatever i want in my pocket, with exact change." the waitress said "wow that's very smart of you! normally people would ask for a million dollars, but then would be out of money once it's all spent. however, this way you always have as much money as you need without running out!"  so the man continued, "for my second wish, i want for my truck to always reach my destination, no matter how slick, rocky, or overall dangerous the terrain." the waitress said "woah, that's very smart as well! but what about the chicken?"  the man answered "ah, i slipped up, i said i wanted a cute chick who follows me wherever i go, and agrees with everything i say..."	1

my brother and i both went to the mall today. we were both hanging around, having a nice time together. then suddenly out of a blue, a guy came up to us, holding a lighter in his hand. he looked awfully fishy and he gave us a strange stare.    "hey, boys. ya mind if i ask ya a question?"   "what is it?" my brother asked, unperturbed by the man's strange behaviour.   "i just wanted to know... you two know each other well?" he raised his eyebrow.   "what? of course we do!" i replied, confused.   "i see, i see..." the man nodded his head mysteriously. "lemme guess... you're related? siblings, maybe?"   "yeah, you got it. why do you ask?" my brother asked, now as perplexed as i was.   "heh, it's nothing. it's just as i thought, huh..." the man took his lighter and turned it on.   "wait, what the hell are you doing with that thing?" i asked, a bit nervous now. the man didn't respond. instead, he took his lit lighter towards us. we both backed away, but he approached us.   soon, we had to call for help. it was clear this man was trying to burn us, for whatever reason. thankfully, the other mallgoers nearby heard our cries and managed to come and get him away from us. he still tried to approach us, however.   "sir, put the lighter down!"   "you're going to hurt them!"   "wait, wait! why're you guys tryna stop me?" the man asked. "is it wrong for a man to try and smoke now?"   "smoke?!" i cried out. "what the hell?! are we just cigarettes to you?!"   the man then looked me in the eye clearly.   "yeah. i thought you just said you were mall-bros, sonny."	1

after a long illness, a woman died and arrived at the gates of heaven.   while she was waiting for saint peter to greet her, she peeked through the gates. she saw a beautiful banquet table. sitting around were her parents and all the other people she had loved and who had died before her. they saw her and began calling greetings to her, "hello! how are you! we've been waiting for you! good to see you!" when saint peter came by, the woman said to him, "this is such a wonderful place! how do i get in? "you have to spell a word", saint peter told her. "which word?" the woman asked. "love." the woman correctly spelled love and saint peter welcomed her into heaven. about three years later, saint peter came to the woman and asked her to watch the gates of heaven for him that day. while the woman was guarding the gates of heaven, her husband arrived. "i'm surprised to see you," the woman said. "how have you been?" "oh, i've been doing pretty well since you died," her husband told her. "i married the beautiful young nurse who took care of you while you were ill. and then i won the lottery. i sold the little house you and i lived in and bought a big mansion. and my wife and i traveled all around the world. we were on vacation and i went water skiing today. i fell, the ski hit my head, and here i am. how do i get in?"

two hunters are walking through the woods when they stumble upon a large hole in the ground. the first hunter says to the other, "that looks really deep.  i can't even see the bottom.  i wonder how far it goes."    to find out how deep it really is, the hunters toss some nearby pebbles into the hole and try to listen for when the pebbles hit the bottom.  none of the pebbles make a sound so the second hunter suggests that they try dropping something heavier into the hole.  the hunters find an old, rusty anvil, carry it over, and drop it into the hole.  there's still no sound.  suddenly a goat comes running through the woods toward the hunters at an incredible speed.  terrified and amazed, the hunters run away and seek safety.  they come across a farm where they're approached by a farmer who asks, "say there, you guys didn't happen to see my goat around here, did you?"  "it's funny that you should ask about a goat," replies the first hunter.  "we saw one charging at us a few minutes ago in the woods.  it was going really fast.  could it have been yours?"  "impossible," says the farmer.  "i chained my goat to an anvil."	1

a hunting tale there’s a fly flying above a stream and there’s a fish watching the fly and it’s thinking “if that fly drops 6 inches i’m gonna have a great meal.” meanwhile, there’s a bear on the bank watching the fish thinking, “if that fly drops 6 inches that fish is gonna get the fly and i’m gonna have a great meal.” behind the bear is a hunter in a bush, and that hunter is thinking, “if that fly drops 6 inches that fish is gonna get it, the bear’s gonna get the fish, and i’m gonna shoot the bear and have myself a great meal.” behind the hunter is a mouse on a log watching the whole thing and it’s thinking, “if that fly drops 6 inches the fish is gonna get it, the bear is gonna eat the fish, the hunter is gonna shoot the bear, and a sandwich will fall out of the hunters back pocket and i’m gonna have a great meal.” behind the mouse there’s a cat watching everybody thinking, “if that fly drops 6 inches the fish is gonna get it, the bear is gonna eat the fish, the hunter will shoot the bear, the mouse will get the sandwich, and i’m gonna pounce on the mouse and have a great meal.” then all of a sudden the fly dropped 6 inches, the fish ate the fly, the bear ate the fish, the hunter shot the bear, the mouse got the hunter’s sandwich and the cat completely jumped over the mouse and into the stream. this just goes to show that when a fly drops 6 inches a pussy’s gonna get wet.	1

a male gorilla at the zoo had been separated from his mate for several months and was really horney.  one night after the zoo had closed and all the animal keepers had left, he decided he was going to tear the bars apart and screw the first thing he could find. as he left his cage and ran through the zoo he came upon a lion sleeping in the grass. he really wasn't thrilled with his find but since he had promised himself he would take the first thing he could get, he grabbed the lion and screwed it.   just as the gorilla finished, the lion awoke and was really pissed. the lion started chasing the gorilla through the zoo and was beginning to gain on him. the gorilla turned a corner and saw a park bench with a newspaper on it. thinking quickly, the gorilla sat down on the bench and held the newspaper in front of him like he was reading it. when the lion turned the corner he stopped at the park bench. not knowing what was behind the newspaper he asked the reader if he had seen a gorilla run by.   from behind the paper, the gorilla said, 'you mean the one that screwed the lion?' the lion shook his head and shouted, 'oh no! it's already in the papers!'	1

this guy got really drunk. so drunk that his friends had to carry him. this guy got really drunk. so drunk that his friends had to carry him.   next morning he wakes up in his own bed, clean, in his pijamas, his wife gone.   groggy as hell, he gets up and starts looking around. in the kitchen he finds an immaculate breakfast, eggs, bacon, coffee and 50 bucks. he finds a note from his wife:   "dearest beloved husband. i hope that my note finds you well. i have prepared this loving breakfast for you and i've left you 50 bucks to go and have a drink with your mates later. lots of love."  stunned, the guy runs back upstairs and shakes his son awake.  "what happened, boy? what's all this?"     "well dad, you came home absolutely pissed and mum was furious. we carried you up to your bedroom and when she started undressing your smelly clothes you began to push her and yell: leave me alone you scank! i'm a married man!"	1

a dog named sex    everybody who has a dog calls him "rover" or "boy." i call mine "sex." he's a great pal, but he has caused me a great deal of embarrassment.  when i went to city hall to renew his dog license, i told the clerk i would like a license for sex. he said, "i'd like one too!"  then, i said, "but this is a dog." he said he didn't care what she looked like. then, i said, "you don't understand, i've had sex since i was 9 years old." he winked and said, "you must have been quite a kid."  when i got married and went on my honeymoon, i took the dog with me. i told the motel clerk that i wanted a room for my wife and me and a special room for sex.  he said, "you don't need a special room. as long as you pay your bill, we don't care what you do." i said, "look, you don't seem to understand. sex keeps me awake at night." the clerk said, "funny -- i have the same problem."  one day, i entered sex in a contest, but before the competition began, the dog ran away. another contestant asked me why i was just standing there, looking disappointed. i told him i had planned to have sex in the contest. he told me i should have sold my own tickets. "but you don't understand," i said, "i had hoped to have sex on tv." he said, "now that cable is all over the place, it's no big deal anymore."  when my wife and i separated, we went to court to fight for custody of the dog. i said, "your honor, i had sex before i was married." the judge said, "the courtroom isn't a confessional. stick to the case, please."  then, i told him that after i was married, sex left me. he said, "me too."  last night, sex ran off again. i spent hours looking all over town for him. a cop came over to me and asked, "what are you doing in this alley at 4 o'clock in the morning?" i told him that i was looking for sex. my case comes up friday.  disclaimer: this isn't my joke, but one i saw from over a decade earlier.  i just love it though.  it's among the funniest jokes i've ever heard and i wanted to share it here.	1
three gentlemen were discussing about the oldest job in the world... a doctor, an electrical engineer and a lawyer were talking about who had the most ancient profession.  the doctor said: "well, god was the first doctor, for he created life itself, so my profession is the oldest!"  the electrical engineer replied: "but wait, before that, god said  'may there be light!'  so he clearly was an electrical engineer! because, before that, there was only chaos!"  "and who the hell you think created chaos!?" replied the lawyer.	1

an irishman walks into a bar in dublin & orders three pints of guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. when he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. the bartender approaches and tells him, "you know, a pint goes flat after i draw it, and it would taste better if you bought one at a time." the irishman replies, well, you see, i have two brothers. one is in america, the other is in australia, and i'm in dublin. when we all left home, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days we drank together. so i drink one for each o'me brothers and one for me self." the bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. the irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way: he orders three pints and drinks them in turn. one day, he comes in and orders two pints. all the other regulars take notice and fall silent. when he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, "i don't want to intrude on your grief, but i wanted to offer my condolences on your loss." the irishman looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns and he laughs. "oh, no, everybody's just fine," he explains, "it's just that me wife had us join that baptist church and i had to quit drinking. but it hasn't affected me brothers though."	1

a priest hooks a huge fish a priest hooks a huge fish  helping him reel it in, a sailor says “whoa, look at the size of that fucker!”.  “hey, mind your language!” says the priest.  embarrassed, the sailor thinks quickly and blurts out, “sorry father, but that’s what this fish is called, it’s a fucker fish”.  accepting the explanation, the priest forgives the sailor and takes the fish back to church.  “look at this huge fucker” says the priest, spotting the bishop.  “language, please! this is god’s house,” replies the bishop.  “no, no that’s what this fish is called, “says the priest.  “oh,” says the bishop, scratching his chin “i could clean that fucker and we could have it for dinner”.  so the bishop takes the fish, cleans it, and brings it to the mother superior.  “could you cook this fucker for dinner tonight?” he asks her.  “my, what language!” she exclaims, clearly shocked.  “no, sister that’s what the fish is called - a fucker”, says the bishop.  satisfied with the explanation, the mother superior says, “wonderful, i’ll cook that fucker tonight, the pope is coming for dinner!”  the fish tastes just great and the pope asks where they got it.  “well, i caught the fucker!” says the priest.  “and i cleaned the fucker!” says the bishop.  “and i cooked the fucker!” says the mother superior.  the pope stares at them for a minute with a steely glaze, leans back on his chair, takes off his cap, puts his feet up on the table, pours himself a whiskey and says:“ you know what?, you cunts are alright.”	1

a woman tries getting on a bus but realizes her skirt is too tight. as the bus stopped and it was her turn to get on, she became aware that her skirt was too tight to allow her leg to come up to the height of the first step of the bus.     slightly embarrassed and with a quick smile to the driver, she reached behind to unzip her skirt a little, thinking this would give her enough slack to raise her leg.   she tries to take the step, but only to discover that she could not.     with a little smile to the driver, she again reaches behind to unzip a little more and again was unable to take the step.     after becoming quite frustrated and embarrassed, she once again attempted to unzip her skirt more in order to allow more legroom to get on the first step of the bus.     about this time, a large texan who was standing behind her, picked her up easily by the waist and placed her gently on the step of the bus.     she went ballistic and turned to the would-be samaritan and yelled, "how dare you touch my body! ! i don't even know who you are!"     the texan smiled and drawled, "well ma'am, normally i would agree with you but after you unzipped my fly three times i kinda figured we were friends."	1

control your woody trevor has a dance coming up and he wants to ask out sally. he would do anything to go with her and he knows she doesn't have a date. the only problem is that whenever he sees her he gets an extremely large boner. before he asks her, he practices not getting a boner but nothing works. so he decides to just call her so he doesn't risk a boner. so he calls her and stutters through the words, but she thinks it is cute so she accepts. at this point he realizes he didn't find a solution to the problem he just put it off. but then he has a great idea! he ties his penis to his leg to conceal the boner. on the day of the dance he heads over to her house and knocks on the door. she answers the door and he kicks her in the face.	1

"of course, my son," jesus said, and when he touched the man's back, he felt relief for the first time in years.  the second man, who wore very thick glasses and had a hard time reading and driving, asked if jesus could do anything about his eyesight.  jesus smiled, removed the man's glasses and tossed them in the lake. when they hit the water, the man's eyes cleared, and he could see everything distinctly.  when jesus turned to heal the union worker, the guy put his hands up and cried, defensively, "don't touch me!  i’m on full term disability!!!	1

hell explained by a chemistry student most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using boyle's law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant. one student, however, wrote the following:  first, we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time. so we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into hell and the rate at which they are leaving . i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. therefore, no souls are leaving. as for how many souls are entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to hell. with birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because boyle's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same! , the volume of hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.  this gives two possibilities:  1. if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose.  2. if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over.  so which is it? if we accept the postulate given to me by teresa during my freshman year that, "it will be a cold day in hell before i sleep with you," and take into account the fact that i slept with her last night, then number two must be true, and thus i am sure that hell is exothermic and has already frozen over. the corollary of this theory is that since hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore, extinct......leaving only heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being which explains why, last night, teresa kept shouting "oh my god."	1

a conductor is getting an orchestra together for a performance but having trouble finding a clarinet player. finally, he calls a contractor who tells him "well, the only guy i've got available at this moment is this jazz clarinetist.”   the conductor replies "i can't stand working with jazz musicians! they dress lousy, they're always late, and they all have an attitude problem.”   “well" replies the contractor "that's all i've got.”   “all right," says the conductor, "i'm getting pretty desperate, so i guess i'll have to take him.”  the first rehearsal is a week later. the conductor arrives early and notices the new clarinetist, wearing a suit and tie, with a pencil on his stand, sitting on stage practicing his part.  during the rehearsal, the clarinetist plays his part quite well, and is responsive to all the conductor's requests. at the second rehearsal, a week later, the same thing happens. this time, the clarinetist turns in a nearly perfect performance.  one week later, at the final dress rehearsal, this occurs again, with the clarinetist now playing his part flawlessly.  at the break in the rehearsal, the conductor says to the orchestra "i've got an apology to make. i was really dreading having to work with a jazz musician, but i must say that our clarinet player has certainly proved me wrong. he is always neatly dressed, he was always here early for the rehearsals, working on the part, and he has really learned the music.”  then, to the clarinet player he says "i just wanted to tell you that i truly appreciate your effort and dedication.”   to which the clarinetist replies "hey man, it's the least i can do, considering i can't make it to the show.”	1

"hormones influence many different areas of your life, and they can be responsible for shifts in mood. starting tonight, i want you to look for how they might affect you."  the next day, the students were all asked how hormones might have played a role in situations they'd seen.  "my older brother spent all night talking to his girlfriend," susie reported. "it was because of the hormones!"  the teacher nodded. "very good! how about you, billy?"  "my pregnant sister started sobbing when she learned that geese could be gay!" declared billy.  the teacher nodded again. "there's a reference that most people won't get!" then, steeling herself, she turned to johnny. "and what about you, johnny?"  "my mother got mad at a hotel room," johnny answered.  several seconds of silence passed.  "i think you need to explain, johnny," said the teacher.  "well," johnny replied, "she found out that my dad was at a hotel instead of at work. when she went to find him, she could hear the hormones."	1

help for men - words & phrases used by women and what they really mean **“fine”**: this is the word she uses to end an argument when she is right and you need to shut up.  **“5 minutes”**: if she’s getting dressed, this means 30 minutes. it only means 5 minutes if you have been given just 5 more minutes to stay on the computer before helping her with the housework.  **“nothing”**: this is the calm before the storm. it means "something". so be on your guard because arguments that begin with “nothing” usually end in "fine".  **“go ahead”**: this is a dare, not a permission to do it. so don't do it.  **“loud sigh”**: although not actually a word, the loud sigh is often misunderstood by men. it means she thinks you are stupid and wonders why she’s wasting her time standing here and arguing with you over "nothing".  **“that's ok”**: one of the most dangerous statements that she can make to a man. it means that she wants to think long and hard before deciding how and when you will pay for your mistake.  **“thanks”**: this is the least used word in her vocabulary. if she’s thanking you, don’t question it. just say "you're welcome" and back out of the room slowly.	1

"on our wedding day we were riding a carriage from the church back to our house and on the way a tree fell down and frightened the horse but your dad managed to get a hold of him. then your dad leaned over to horse and gently said "one!". we continued down the road and a dog ran onto the road and started barking also startling the horse. your dad again managed to calm him down. he leaned to the horse and said "two!". when we arrived at the house a bunch of people ran out yelling and singing to greet us and horse got scared again. your father got hold of the horse for the 3rd time, leaned to him and said "three!". after he said that he grabbed his shotgun and shot the horse dead. i was shocked and started yelling at him "why the hell did you do that?" and your father turned to me and said "one!".	1

there's a little-known legend about attila the hun... the story goes that attila used to collect exotic animals that he found during his conquests. he particularly liked dangerous or fearsome animals, and his favourite was a giant snake. he was so fond of it, it was said that he brought it with him on every campaign.  but his snake lost its appetite, and soon stopped eating altogether; perhaps due to the stress of frequent travel and an irregular diet.  wishing to save his prized pet, attila sought help from the local chirurgeons and witch doctors. none of them could do anything for him, until a wizened sage suggested feeding the serpent only young female virgins.  attila was pleased with this idea, and was delighted to find that a city he had raided just happened to have a christian convent with a convenient supply of the recommended food for his pet.  but the snake refused to eat, or even touch any of the consecrated virgins from the convent. enraged, attila sent for the soothsayer who advised him to have him executed.  standing before attila, the old man calmly said, "before thou killest me, may thee first bring the snake and one of the women to me."  curious, attila did as he asked.  then the old man took some bread and gave it to attila.  "now hold these in both hands," he instructed.  attila did so, and as soon as he did, the snake let out a terrifying hiss, and swallowed the virgin whole.  to an amazed attila, the old man simply said,  "thy anaconda don't want nun unless you've got buns, hun."	1

april and june were dating... the couple had been together many years, and, as far as one could tell from the outside were very happy together. but june had always felt as though there was something between them, something holding them back- something that april was keeping a secret.  as time went by, june got the impression that april was drifting away, and becoming colder. with every day, it felt as though the gap between them grew wider and wider. june had a suspicion as to what the cause might be- a little hussy by the name of may, who lived on the way from april's home to june's. june had seen the way may always made eyes at april when they walked past... she always looked smug, as though she knew something june didn't.  one day, the paranoia became simply too much for june. with nowhere else to turn, june enlisted the help of august, a private investigator, to track april's movements, and find out if there really were some grounds to june's fears.  august, a diligent detective, set about the task immediately, watching april night and day. no single action, no matter how trivial, escaped august's notice. each detail was meticulously recorded in a journal.  one day, about a week later, there was a knock at june's door. nervous to the point of shaking, june opened the door to find august, journal in hand, and with a solemn expression.  "i have bad news, june..."  "what? what is it?" june panicked, grabbing august by the collar. "tell me!"  "i... don't know how to say this, june... i'm sorry. read the last entry..."  with a grimace, august handed june the notebook, already open to the most recent page. june's eyes scanned down the rows of neat notes, to the very last ones, listed as occuring just 20 minutes prior:  april showers.  brings may flowers.	1

a long time ago i read this joke i found so good i wrote it down. i found this note today disclaimer: this joke involves gender-based humour and don't actually reflect the my viewpoint about either gender.  &#x200b;  so there was this billionare, very sucessful enterpreneur, that decided to invest a large chunk of his funds in a new business: the husband shop  the husband shop is a 6-floor building, each containing an assortment of husbands bearing more or less the same characteristics, however the next floor has a costier but better selection.  so, this lady goes to visit the shop and she sees this at the first floor: "at the husband shop we strive to present to you the very best in man. this floor has 100% loyal men".  quite pleased with what she sees, she goes to the next one and it says: "this floor 100% loyal men and they are very handsome!".  she investigates further, and on the third floor she sees: "this floor has 100% loyal men, and they are handsome and romantic!"  on the fourth floor she finds: "this floor has 100% loyal men, which are also very handsome, romantic and great with kids!"  the fifth floor had the following: "this floor has 100% loyal men, all of them are very handsome, romantic, great with kids and they'll rock your world in the bed every time!"  she was absolutely amazed by what they had put together, and she knew they had the best for last, so she found this:  &#x200b;  "congratulations! you are the 4,986,221st visitor this year! sorry, there are no husbands in this floor. we regret to inform we abandoned "the husband shop" development as we realized women were nearly impossible to please".  \\---------------------------------------------------  bonus joke  &#x200b;  in order to appeal to both genders (and alleviate the uproar of sexism accusations), the billionare made "the wife shop", and they put a lot more effort this time around.  since the other business became so famous because of the unusual service, a reporter did some digging, and he came back with this:  "upon arriving 'the wife shop', or tws, the costumer is immediatly greeted by an employee that will explain the concept of the business and will acompany him or her through the floors, in the same method they used on the husband shop.  the first floor says: welcome to the wife shop! we keep our promise to strive for excellency, but this time it's all about finding you your perfect wife! this floor has the most gourgeous women you'll ever find.  the second floor says: "this floor has absolutely gorgeous women and they are all incredible in the bedroom.  the 4 remaining floors are yet to be visited".	1

in ancient times, an mighty warrior of the germanic tribes cut a swathe through the roman legions. his name was dolf, but he was more commonly called by another name, whispered by mothers to their children as a warning - "the red", owing to the spatters of roman blood that covered his wolfskin armour after battles.  it was a week before christmas night that dolf strode into a small inn, owned by an old ex-centurion and his family. he demanded an ale, and when the barkeeper querulously asked for payment of three copper pieces, dolf glowered at him and said: "do you see my wolfskin armour, old man? do you see the blood spatters on the fur? do you not know who i am," and glancing at the old roman armour and sword handing above the fireplace, spat out, "you filthy old centurion?"  the barkeeper's wife, who'd been listening with one ear, looked over at dolf and said, "you, braggart, are rude, filthy and german. and your 'blood spatters' are just dark patches where the rain has soaked in."  "it's not rain, it's blood, you roman witch!" screamed dolf, pulling out his sword. he then proceeded to slaughter everyone in the inn, the surrounding villages, and nearby farms. he climbed trees to stab the birds, set cruel traps to maul the animals, and spent three days sifting through the dirt around the inn to find all the insects burrowed there, and squash them with his mighty knuckle.  finally, when his spate of death was complete, it was christmas night. he walked over to the now flayed innkeepers wife, who was trussed above the fire. sticking his bloody face into hers, he said, "rude dolf the red *knows* rain, dear."	1

a girl and her sniper rifle  i had a friend named sierra once. she was a pretty chill girl. really only had two defining characteristics about her though, her love of lemon-lime sodas and her innate marksmanship. she was a damn good crackshot.     her dad was a bit of a gun nut. owned lots of rifles including a classic, old-time sniper from back in the wwii era. beautiful old thing. she learned to fire it at age 12, could hit targets at 100 meters by age 15. she ended up entering some sharpshooting competition around the area.     this one competition was particularly important to her because it was sponsored by a soda company. the prize was a year's supply of any soda the winner wanted. of course, my friend entered for that delicious lemon-lime goodness. so she hefted her trusty old sniper over to the field.     there were 16 contestants so the competition was a single-elimination bracket. the rules were simple. stand behind the line, aim and fire. if you hit it, the target got pushed back a few meters. if you miss and the other guy hits it, you're out.     well my friend easily blew most of the competitors out of the water. punks couldn't hit the broad side of a barn. she completely cleared out her side of the bracket with almost no competition.     it came down to the final round. she was up against jackson.     at 6 foot 6, this guy was an intimidating foe. even with those catcher's glove-sized hands he still wielded his rifle with the grace of a ballerina. completely wiped out his side of the bracket. it was getting tense.     he fired off first. 50 meters. easy.   her next. 50 meters. easy.   and then him. 100 meters. easy.   her. 100 meters. easy.   150. harder.   200. harder.   300. barely made it.     but it came down to the wire. two bottles, 400 meters down the field. jackson stepped up first, sweat dripping down his face. he fired.     bang.     crack.     the bullet nicked the side, shattering the target. but you could see the jackson's nervousness. it was clear that he would not be able to hit the next target. it was up to sierra now.     she was sweating buckets. it all came down to this. if she could tap that glass even slightly, she'd be looking at a year's supply of her favorite soft drink.     she lined up her shot. stared down the sights. the audience looked on in anticipation. her lemon-lime drinks were on the line. this was all she needed.     bang.     .     .     .     nothing. her soda was gone.     sierra missed.	1

dave is a well known, respected hunter, known to be the best in the state. one night, he is sitting in a bar with some friends, and an out of state hunter stops in the bar.  he overhears dave’s friends talking about how he’s the best and says, “there is no way he is the best hunter in the state!”  so dave bets him that he can not look and guess what an animal was an how it died by its fur. for every one he gets right, the hunter will buy him a beer.  thinking he can’t possibly do this, the hunter agrees. he gives dave a skin, and after a pause, he says “black bear, killed by a .308 rifle.” he was right, and got a beer. another bar patron went and got a pelt from his car trunk and gives it to dave. after a few minutes of feeling the fur, dave says “elk, killed by a 7mm rifle.”  he was right again, and swigged another pint.  this went on long through the night, with the hunter and other patrons bringing dave pelts and furs, giving him beer after beer, until he stumbled home drunk of his ass. he woke up the next morning with one hell of a shiner, and asked his wife “i know i was drunk last night, but not drunk enough to get in a fight and not remember it! what happened?”  “you didn’t get in a fight, i gave that to you.”  “you? but you’re my wife. why would you hit me?”  “because last night when you came home, you came into bed next to em, put your hand down my panties and loudly declared ‘skunk! killed by an axe!’”	1

trump is visiting a class in an elementary school where they are talking about words and meanings the teacher asks trump if he would like to lead the class in a discussion of the word “tragedy”.  so he asks the class for an example of a tragedy. one little boy stands up and offers, “if my best friend who lives on a farm is playing in a field and a runaway tractor comes along and knocks him dead, that’d be a tragedy.”  “not quite”, says mr. trump, “that would be an accident.”  a little girl raises her hand: “if a school bus carrying 50 children drove over a cliff, killing everyone inside, that would be a tragedy.”  “i’m afraid not,” explained the president. “that’s what we would call a great loss.”  the room goes silent. trump searches the room. “isn’t there someone here who can give me an example of a tragedy? “  finally at the back of the room, little johnny raises his hand. in a quiet voice he says, “if air force one, carrying you was struck by a missile and blown to smithereens; that would be a tragedy.”  “fantastic!” exclaimed mr. trump. “that’s right. and can you tell me why that would be a tragedy?”  “well’, said little johnny, “because it sure as hell wouldn’t be a great loss and probably wouldn’t be an accident either.”	1

"excuse me ma'am, can you spare a moment to take a look at some alarming literature and help support our cause?" he half-shouted at her.  the mother held up her hand and tried to pass, but the protester blocked her and continued. "it is *imperative* that we evacuate the colony! did you know that the dirt in which we live, in which we *raise our children*, contains magnesium *and* aluminum? and god knows what else!"  again, she politely but firmly shook her head, pulling her daughter along as the man shouted after her, "you owe it to your little girl to evacuate *now!!"*  after they gained some distance, the young ant looked up worriedly at her mother. "was that man right, mommy? are we in danger?"  the mother smiled. "no sweetheart, don't worry. just because they use big words to try to scare us doesn't mean the ant evacs movement has any idea what it's talking about."	1

"bring them along," the lawyer replied. turning to the other poor man he stated, "you come with us also." the second man, in a pitiful voice, then said, "but sir, i also have a wife and six children with me!" "bring them all, as well," the lawyer answered. they all entered the car, which was no easy task, even for a car as large as the limousine was. once underway, one of the poor fellows turned to the lawyer and said, "sir, you are too kind. thank you for taking all of us with you." the lawyer replied, "glad to do it.  you'll really love my place. the grass is almost a foot high."	1

bull testicles (this isn't necessarily nsfw but it's not for people who get grossed out easily so you've been warned) my dad told me this a few years back  a tourist in spain is in a restaurant near a bullfighting arena right after a bullfight. there's a table nearby where a guy is eating a dish with two big balls in it and all around the table people are making merry. the tourist got curious and asked the manager to explain what was going on.   the manager said," well you see, in spain we have these bullfights and after the bull loses, it's killed and the balls are cooked into a dish as tradition. it's said to increase bravery and masculinity of the eater."  the tourist was interested.  "will i be able to buy that dish?"  "well it's not common as we require the prized bull and a bullfight, not to mention it's expensive and you'll have to preorder it."  "it's alright i'll wait don't worry about the money or anything i'll pay but i want that dish."  and the deal was done.  a few days later he had the dish and he loved it. in fact he loved it so much he asked to see the chef  he said to the chef," i really loved the dish it was delicious thank you very much. although i have 1 question. that day when i saw the dish the balls were really big but today not so much, why is that?"  and the chef replied," well unfortunately sometimes the bull wins."    note: if you're spanish pls don't b offended i also did some research and they do not eat human testicles. tho the bull testicles is true. dish is called criadillas if anyone's interested.	1

parrot it's a woman and it's her birthday, so she decides to go out and buy herself a parrot. she goes to a lot of stores, but she can't find one. disappointed, she decides to go home. finally, she sees a pet store where she hasn't been yet so she goes to see if she can find a parrot there. she goes to see the salesman and asks him if he has a parrot.   "no, sorry, i don't."  "but i see one at the back of your shop, it's got a bit of a strange face but well..."  "it's not for sale, it'll get you in trouble."  "i don't care, it's my birthday, i absolutely want one!"  "well, ok, but he grew up in a brothel, so he's a bit vulgar."  so she buys the parrot and goes home. then she gets ready to go out to celebrate her birthday with some friends and when she gets to the front door, the parrot starts talking.  "hey bitch! you're gonna get fucked tonight, aren't you? bitch..."  she doesn't pay attention to him and leaves. she comes home at 4am and the parrot says to her.  "so bitch? did you get fucked good?"  she's tired, so she's going to bed. she wakes up the next day and goes to breakfast. there the parrot talks to her again.  "hey bitch! you're walking funny today, you got fucked really good last night, didn't you? fucking slut..."  she finally gets mad and goes back to the store where she bought the parrot. she asks the clerk if he has a solution to calm the parrot down.  "i might have something that could work. it's a special black paint, it'll shut him up."  so she goes home and as usual the parrot greets her.  "hey bitch!"  she takes the paint and paints it black. then he says nothing more. after a week without him saying anything she goes to him and says.  "well, asshole? you don't talk now, do you?"  "when i'm in a tuxedo, i don't talk to bitches."	1

probably a blonde! a woman decides to have a face lift for her 50th birthday. she spends $15,000 and looks sensational.  on her way home, she stops at a news stand to buy a newspaper. before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘i hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think i am?”.  ‘about 32,’ is the reply.’  ‘nope! i’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.  a little while later she goes into mcdonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.  the girl replies, ‘i’d guess about 29.’ the woman replies with a big smile, ‘nope, i’m 50.’  now she’s feeling really good about herself. she stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.  she goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.  the clerk responds, ‘oh, i’d say 30.’  again she proudly responds, ‘i’m 50, but thank you!’  while waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.  he replies, ‘lady, i’m 78 and my eyesight is going. although, when i was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. it sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra then, and only then i can tell you exactly how old you are.’  they wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. she finally blurts out, ‘what the hell, go ahead.’  he slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. he bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. he pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.  after a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘okay, okay.....how old am i?’  he completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘madam, you are 50.’  stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘that was incredible, how could you tell?’  ‘i was behind you at mcdonalds’.	1

dylan was practicing his golf swing in his front yard when he swung a little too hard and sent the ball through his neighbors window. dylan ran over and rang the doorbell three times. after no one answered for a few minutes, he opened the door to see broken glass everywhere, a lamp lying on the ground, and a huge fat arabian man wearing a turban sitting on the couch.   dylan asked, "who are you?"   the fat man replied, "i am a genie you have freed from that lamp."   dylan questioned, "oh man, do i get three wishes?"   the genie replied, "since you freed me by accident you only get two and i get one."   dylan thought about it and realized what he wanted, "i want to be the best golfer ever."   the surprised genie said, "you sure? most people wish for money, but okay. now your wife gets one wish."   dylan brought over his wife who wished right away, "i want a million dollars every week of my life."   the genie said, "granted. and now for my wish, i have been cramped up in that lamp for many years so its been a while since i've been with a woman. i want one day of wild, crazy sex with your wife, dylan."   dylan said, "no way!"   the genie replied, "not even for a million dollars a week?"   dylan turned to his wife, who said, "i guess for all that, i should. well, not until dylan leaves."   dylan said, "okay, have fun, i guess," and left.   dylan's wife then proceeded to have wild sex for the rest of the day with the genie. when they were finished, the genie asked how old her husband was.   she said, "forty-five."   the genie laughed and said, "isn't he a little old to be believing in genies?"	1

the leprechaun thief i met a leprechaun once, in a pub in ireland. he was just minding his own business when i sat down on the stool next to him and ordered my drink.  "your favourite stout, please.", i said to the bartender. the leprechaun turned his head and sized me up.  "you're a proper lad", he quipped.  "thank you...", i responded hesitantly. i didn't want to be rude, so we struck up conversation and after a few pints i felt ready to ask him what i had wondered since i first saw him.  "so ... friend, what's a leprechaun doing here in a pub anyway? what's your story?"  "oh, you see lad, i'm just out of prison and i thought i'd just celebrate with a couple of drinks before i head home."  "prison, you say? what were you in for?"  "theft. i used to be quite an unscrupulous man when i was younger. i was damn good at it too. never caught once."  "but how did you end up in prison if you never got caught?"  "i'll get to that. so anyway, i started out by stealing iron from the mines of the trolls. there was this ventilation duct in the mine where someone of my stature had no problem getting both in and out with it. this worked out for a while, until..."  he paused and took a swig of his drink.  "i got greedy. so i moved on to a higher value target. i started stealing copper from the hobgoblins. but it was stressful. the bastards have a good sense of smell, so i had to smear myself with cow-dung before every heist. it's not a pretty sight, and the smell lasts for days."  "it didn't really take long before i took it even further, and started stealing the silver that the fairies were digging up to use for their fairy dust. it was easier and more lucrative than the previous job. but at this point my conscience had started to wear on me. i'm not a god fearing man by any means, but i could feel as if i was being judged."  "so what happened then?", i inquired.  "well, i thought it was just going to be one more gig. one last job to make bank. so this time, i targeted the most high value mining operation in the land, but i couldn't go through with it. i had a mental breakdown and turned myself in on the spot."  "why?"  "i don't know lad. i just felt that i couldn't take gnome ore..."	1

"is it a peach?" billy asks. "no, i'm afraid it's a potato. but i like the way you think" the teacher replies. "here's another: it's long, yellow, and fairly hard."  by now johnny is about to explode as he waves his hand frantically. the teacher skips him again and calls on sally. "a banana," she says. "no," the teacher replies, "it's a squash, but i like the way you think."  johnny has had enough, so he speaks up loudly. "hey, i've got one for you teacher; let me put my hand down my pants. okay, i've got it: it's round, hard, and it's got a head on it."  "johnny!" she cries. "that's disgusting!"  "nope," answers johnny, "it's a quarter... *but i like the way you think!!!*"	1

lawyers should never ask a virginia grandma a question if they aren't prepared for the answer in a trial, a small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. he approached her and asked, 'mrs. jones, do you know me?' she responded, 'why, yes, i do know you, mr. williams. i've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. you lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. you think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. yes, i know you.' the lawyer was stunned. not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'mrs. jones, do you know the defense attorney?' she again replied, 'why yes, i do. i've known mr. bradley since he was a youngster, too. he's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. he can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. one of them was your wife. yes, i know him.' the defense attorney nearly died. the judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said, 'if either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, i'll send you both to the electric chair.	1

"no problem," the tired travelers assured him. "i'll take it." the next morning dave came down to breakfast bright-eyed and bushy tailed. "how'd you sleep?" asked the manager.

"he was already in bed, snoring away, when i came in the room," dave explained. "i went over, gave him a kiss on the cheek, said, 'goodnight, beautiful,' and he sat up all night watching me."	1

the night the eiffel tower’s lights went out one fateful night, the lights on the eiffel tower went out. it was, of course, a national tragedy for all of france and quite a problem, not the least of which being the fact that airplanes could very easily fly right into the thing.   the french government called every last engineer or electrician they could think of, and each one tried to fix the lights with no success. it was a baffling, befuddling problem that it seemed nobody could solve.   then, out of nowhere, a man with the smallest hands anyone had ever seen came to the french officials and said, “i’ll do it. i’ll fix lights.”  the officials asked him what qualifications he had.   “none.”  they asked him his plan.  “none.”  the officials laughed, but they were out of options. so they sent the man up to the top of the tower with no hope that he could succeed.   but he did.   within minutes, the lights on the eiffel tower shined brighter than they ever had. the officials were stunned, but elated. as the small-handed man came back down from the tower, they regaled him and hailed him as a national hero.   one question remained, however.  “how’d you do it? how’d you fix it?”  the man’s speech was poor, and he said few words, but he did say this:  “mini hands make light work.”	1

a joke from my joke calender a man has to leave for a few days and wants to find a temporary home for his parrot.  because he knows the priest also has a parrot, he decides to ask him if he can watch his.  'absolutely not.' the priest says. 'all your parrot knows is how to curse. that's not good for my parrot, as all mine does is pray.'  'but your parrot will be able to teach mine some manners.' the man points out.   after doing some thinking the man agrees and says he'll watch the parrot. he takes him to his house and puts him next to his own parrot.  'i want sex, i want sex.' the parrot says.  'hallelujah.' the other one says. 'my prayers have been answered!'   edit: i hope this translates right! originally dutch.	1

a man walks into a bank he's accompanied by a broker. the man asks to speak to someone about making a large deposit, so the banker sends him straight to the boss.  "good morning," says the man, "i'm here to deposit $40,000.  "well now," says the banker, "how did you acquire such funds? we like to keep a clean note system here."  "not to worry," the man spoke assuredly, " the money i make is essentially winnings. see, i'm a gambler of sorts."   "oh really?" the banker, who is also a gambler, inquires. "how so?"  "let's have a wager shall we? i'll bet you a grand i can lick my eyeball."   the banker thought surely this was the quickest grand he would ever make, and shakes the man's hand. to his surprise, the man popped out his left eyeball, a fake, and licked it, and out it back into his socket.   "well i'll be..." the banker exclaimed, mildly furious he fell for that.   "but wait, i'll bet you another 5 grand i can bite my ear."   without hesitation the banker agreed, and to his distraught the man pulled  out his dentures and clamped them to his ear, and put them back into his mouth.   "you slimy weasel, i should've seen that coming." the banker exclaimed, now turning red in the face.  "i've got one more wager, how about......" he paused for a moment. "i bet 10k that i can stand in that corner of the room, and piss into the mug on your desk, and not get a single drop anywhere."  "bet."  the man proceeded to the corner, unzipped his pants, and proceeded to piss literally everywhere in the bankers office, including the banker himself. the only place he didn't was in the cup.  "ha!" the banker yelled with excitement, that was the easiest 10 grand i've ever made!"  "indeed," said the man, "i bet my broker here 50,000 that i could piss all over you and you would love it."	1

a burglar broke into a house one night.... a burglar broke into a house one night. he shined his flashlight around, looking for valuables when a voice in the dark said, 'jesus knows you're here.'     he nearly jumped out of his skin, clicked his flashlight off, and froze. when he heard nothing more, he shook his head and continued.     just as he pulled the stereo out so he could disconnect the wires, clear as a bell he heard 'jesus is watching you.'     startled, he shined his light around frantically, looking for the source of the voice. finally, in the corner of the room, his flashlight beam came to rest on a parrot.     'did you say that?' he hissed at the parrot.     'yes', the parrot confessed, then squawked, 'i'm just trying to warn you that he's watching you.'     the burglar relaxed. 'warn me, huh? who in the world are you?'     'moses,' replied the bird.     'moses?' the burglar laughed. 'what kind of people would name a bird moses?'     'the kind of people who would name a rottweiler jesus.'	1

once there was a man who went to the bar often. he would always come home drunk, and his girlfriend had enough of it. one night, after the man had come home (drunk, of course), his girlfriend said "if you come home drunk *one more time*, i'm leaving you and taking the kids."  the next night, the man goes to the bar, and after a few hours of drinking, he throws up on himself. before he leaves the bar, he turns to a random man and says "buddy, you gotta help. my girlfriend said that if i came home drunk again, she'd break up with me."  the stranger thinks for a moment, and takes out a 20-dollar bill and hands it to the man. the stranger says "put this in your jacket pocket. when you get home, tell your girlfriend that somebody else puked on you, and he gave you money for the dry-cleaning."  the man gets home, and his girlfriend is on the couch. she immediately asks "what's with the vomit? did you get drunk again?" the man pulls out the money and says "i did go to the bar, but i didn't get drunk; this is from another guy, and he gave me twenty bucks to get it cleaned."  his girlfriend asks, "then why are you holding two twenty-dollar bills?" the man thinks and answers, "that's from the guy who shit in my pants."	1

in a trial, a southern small-town prosecuting attorney called his first witness, a grandmotherly, elderly woman to the stand. he approached her and asked… 'mrs. jones, do you know me?'   she responded, 'why, yes, i do know you, mr. williams. i've known you since you were a boy, and frankly, you've been a big disappointment to me. you lie, you cheat on your wife, and you manipulate people and talk about them behind their backs. you think you're a big shot when you haven't the brains to realize you'll never amount to anything more than a two-bit paper pusher. yes, i know you.'  the lawyer was stunned. not knowing what else to do, he pointed across the room and asked, 'mrs. jones, do you know the defense attorney?'  she again replied, 'why yes, i do. i've known mr. bradley since he was a youngster, too. he's lazy, bigoted, and he has a drinking problem. he can't build a normal relationship with anyone, and his law practice is one of the worst in the entire state. not to mention he cheated on his wife with three different women. one of them was your wife. yes, i know him.'  the defense attorney nearly died.  the judge asked both counselors to approach the bench and, in a very quiet voice, said,  'if either of you idiots asks her if she knows me, i'll send you both to the electric chair.	1

a rabbit, a fox and a bear have to enroll in the army. neither of the 3 are very happy about it and the only chance they have to avoid it is by being rejected during the medical exam. as they are waiting in line at the doctors office their desperation builds up untill right before it's the rabbits turn.     the rabbit turns to the fox: "fox i might have a plan, bite off my ear, trust me on this one!!". the fox does so and the rabbit enters the office. a few moments later, he gets out yelling "i was rejected guys!!"    "because of your ear?" they ask. "yes, because without it i can't detect the enemy as well" says rabbit. "good thinking" . and with that in mind the fox turns to the bear "rip my tail off!!". the bear doesn't even hesitate  and does so. then the fox takes his turn in the office. after a while he comes back yelling "i am rejected too!. without my tail, they said,  i can't be as sneaky and agile as i need to be".    now it was the bears turn to ask; "quickly guys knock out all of my teeth, 'cuz a bear without teeth isn't scary at all!" the rabbit and the fox start beating the muzzle of the bear, completly breaking his face untill  there is no tooth is left in his mouth. he then proceeds to go inside the doctors office. not long after he gets out he shouts "rejecwew!!.   "nice" they say. "because of your teeth, right?" "nwo" says the bear "too fat"	1

"ahhh i see" says the priest "this must have been the point where you swore"  "nope not yet.  the bird flew over the green the ball fell from its mouth and landed two feet from the hole"  the priest pauses for a few seconds "you missed the fucking putt didn't you?"	1

angry cowboy a cowboy rode into town and stopped at a saloon for a drink.  unfortunately, the locals always had a habit of picking on strangers, which he was. when he finished his drink, he found his horse had been stolen. he went back into the bar, handily flipped his gun into the air, caught it above his head without even looking and fired a shot into the ceiling.  "which one of you sidewinders stole my horse?!" he yelled with surprising forcefulness. no one answered.  "alright, i'm gonna have another beer, and if my horse ain't back outside by the time i finish, i'm gonna do what i dun in texas! and i don't like to have to do what i dun in texas!" some of the locals shifted restlessly.  the man, true to his word, had another beer, walked outside, and his horse has been returned to the post.  he saddled up and started to ride out of town. the bartender wandered out of the bar and asked, "say partner, before you go... what happened in texas?" the cowboy turned back and said, "i had to walk home."	1

an irishman walks into a bar in dublin, orders three pints of guinness and sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn. when he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more. the bartender approaches and tells him, "you know, a pint goes flat after i draw it. "it would taste better if you bought one at a time." the irishman replies, "well, you see, i have two brothers. one is in america, the other is in australia, and i’m in dublin. when we all left home, we promised that we’d drink this way to remember the days we drank together. so i drink one for each o'me brothers and one for me self." the bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there. the irishman becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way: he orders three pints and drinks them in turn.  one day, he comes in and orders two pints. all the other regulars take notice and fall silent. when he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, "i don’t want to intrude on your grief, but i wanted to offer my condolences on your loss." the irishman looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns and he laughs. "oh, no, everybody's just fine!"  he explains, "it's just that my wife had us join that baptist church and i had to quit drinking. but it hasn't affected me brothers though."	1

"yes i have," says the man.  "and has she helped you make a decision?"  "yes," says the man.  "what is your decision?" asks the doctor.  "we're getting granite counter tops."	1

boudreaux the baptist boudreaux was a cajun highlander from rapides parish in central louisiana who was born and raised a baptist . each friday night after work, he would fire up his outdoor grill and cook a venison steak.  now, as a point of interest, all of boudreaux's neighbors were catholic and as such were forbidden to eat meat on fridays.  the delicious aroma from the grilled venison steaks was causing such a problem for the catholic faithful that they finally talked to their priest. the priest came to visit boudreaux and suggested that boudreaux convert to catholicism. boudreaux agreed. after several classes and much study, boudreaux attended mass to be confirmed. as the priest sprinkled holy water over boudreaux he said, "you were born a baptist and raised a baptist, but now you are a catholic."  boudreaux's neighbors were greatly relieved until the next friday night arrived and the wonderful aroma of grilled venison again filled the air. the priest was called by some of his angry parishioners and told of boudreaux'’s actions . the priest assured the callers that he would be there immediately. when he got there he rushed into boudreaux's yard clutching a rosary. he was prepared to scold boudreaux for what he was doing but what he saw and heard made him stop in amazement. there at the grill stood boudreaux. he was clutching a small bottle of water, which he carefully sprinkled over the sizzling meat as he chanted: "you wuz born a deer, and you wuz raised a deer, but now you are a catfish."	1

"what happened to the dogs? !!!" he growled.  the minister then said, "i served the dogs for only 10 days and they didn't forget my service. i served you for 10 years and you forgot all at the first mistake!"  the king realised his mistake and replaced the dogs with crocodiles!	1

jack, a renown atheist, dies and to his utter surprise ends up in hell where he's greeted by satan himself. completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: "welp, i've been wrong all my life and i guess i'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith". satan laughs and replies: awh it's not so bad. he then proceeds to escort jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other "damned" live. as they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, a request that's always granted by the two. every time they stop at a house satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person. at sunset the devil sees that jack is very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity in.  as they walk to jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and jack asks: "what's behind there?" satan: "oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind". despite his curiosity jack thought better not to bother satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day. that night however jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he was in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day. after a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that satan couldn’t even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was. once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall. jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be. on the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help. jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.  the following morning satan showed up once again and told jack to come with him. jack pleaded: "please! please! don't take me to hell, i'll do anything, just let me stay here; i don't wanna burn for all eternity!" satan: "what are you talking about??? i'm just gonna show you the recreational center like i told you yesterday". jack: "don’t lie to me, i saw what was going on behind the giant wall!" satan: "ooooh, you saw that! don't worry, that's not for you, that's the christian hell". jack: "the christian hell? why would the christian hell be like that?" satan: "i don’t know either man, they just want it that way".	1

i recall my first time with a condom, i must have been 16. recall my first time with a condom, i must have been 16. i went in to buy a packet of condoms at the pharmacy. there was this beautiful assistant behind the counter, and she could see that i was new at it. she handed me the package and asked if i knew how to wear one. i honestly answered, "no, this is my first time." so she unwrapped the package, took one out and slipped it over her thumb. she cautioned me to make sure it was on tight and secure. i apparently still looked confused. so she looked all around the store to see if it was empty. it was empty. "just a minute." she said, and walked to the door, and locked it. taking my hand, she led me into the back room, unbuttoned her blouse and removed it. she unhooked her bra and laid it aside. "do these excite you?" she asked. well, i was so dumb-struck that all i could do was shake my head. she then said it was time to slip the condom on. as i was slipping it on, she dropped her skirt, removed her knickers and sat down at a desk. "well, come on," she said, "we don't have much time." so i climbed on her. it was so wonderful, that unfortunately, i could no longer hold back and kapow. i was done within a few minutes. she looked at me with a bit of a frown, "did you put that condom on?" she asked. i said, "i sure did." and held up my thumb to show her.	1

so, as everyone knows, two different species (flavors) of cheerios cannot mate, right? that is, if one is honey-nut and another is blueberry, they cannot mate. anyway, there is this one normal cheerio that is in love with a blueberry cheerio. unfortunately, he cannot mate with her. he can't even communicate with her because they are of different species. so, he invents a machine that changes all of his cna (cheerio dna) into whichever type of cheerio that he wants. however, this machine performs a process that is extraordinarily painful, because that sort of thing would hurt. anyway. he does it, and the normal flavored cheerio becomes a blueberry cheerio. unfortunately, this girl cheerio hates him so much that she invents an identical machine and does the process on herself in order to become a cinnamon-apple cheerio, just so she can avoid this creeper. so, she does it. the boy cheerio is starting to get upset at this because he really wants her. so he tells himself that he will go through the pain for her, and becomes a cinnamon-apple cheerio. she then changes to a honey-nut cheerio! he decides that this is the last time that he will change cheerio type. he does it, and she changes one more time, into a normal cheerio - the kind he originally was. so he says out loud, "okay, this is really the last time. if she changes again, i will just stay back with my family." so he becomes a normal cheerio again, and she doesn't change fast enough for him to put his moves on her. so, they start dating, and he finally asks her to the formal bowl (ahaha, get it, bowl instead of ball). anyway, they get there and dance intensely for a few hours. finally, they get tired and she sends the boy cheerio to the milk bowl (you know, since it's a cereal dance, they have that and punch). he gets there and stands in line for ten minutes. finally fed up at the really long line, he looks over at the bowl of punch and sees that there is no punch line.	1
a father finds a letter written by his son  a father passing by his son's bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up. then, he saw an envelope, propped up prominently on the pillow. it was addressed, 'dad'. with the worst premonition, he opened the envelope and read the letter, with trembling hands.     dear, dad. it is with great regret and sorrow that i'm writing you. i had to elope with my new girlfriend, because i wanted to avoid a scene with mum and you.     i've been finding real passion with stacy. she is so nice, but i knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than i am.     but it's not only the passion, dad. she's pregnant. stacy said that we will be very happy. she owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. we share a dream of having many more children.     stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. we'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.     in the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for aids so that stacy can get better. she sure deserves it!     don't worry dad, i'm 15, and i know how to take care of myself. someday, i'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.     love, your son, joshua.     p.s . dad, none of the above is true. i'm over at jason's house. i just wanted to remind you that there are worse things in life than the school report that's on the kitchen table. call when it is safe for me to come home!	1

why their are angels on top of the xmas tree have you ever wondered how the tradition of putting an angel on the tree started? it may not be as magical as you might think,   when four of santa's elves got sick, the trainee elves did not produce toys as fast as the regular ones, and santa began to feel the pre-christmas pressure.  then mrs. claus told santa that her mother was coming to visit, which stressed santa even more. when he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where.  then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered.  frustrated, santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. when he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.  in his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor.  he went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom. just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big christmas tree.  the angel said very cheerfully, "merry christmas, santa. isn't this a lovely day? i have a beautiful tree for you. where would you like me to stick it?"  and thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the christmas tree.

preacher  a young preacher was asked by the local funeral director to hold a grave-side burial service at a small local cemetery for someone with no family or friends.   the preacher headed out early but quickly got himself lost, making several wrong turns. eventually, a half- hour late, he saw the backhoe and its crew, but the hearse was nowhere in sight, and the workmen were eating lunch.   the diligent young pastor went to the open grave and found the vault lid already in place. taking out his  book, he read the service. feeling guilty because of his tardiness, he preached an impassioned and l lengthy service, sending the deceased to the great beyond in style.   as he was returning to his car, he overheard one of the workmen say, "i've been putting in septic tanks for twenty years and i ain't never seen anything like that."	1

two guys decide that they'd go out drinking on the night before their exam. wasted on the night before, the two arrive at the university well after the exam ended. they went straight to the professor, saying that they couldn't take the test because one of the car's tires had gone flat. surprisingly, the professor allows them and promptly tells them to come back tomorrow.  the two take this chance to cram as much as they can, and they return to the professor, ready for the test. the prof takes them into separate rooms and hands over their test papers. flipping it over, they howl in laughter, seeing these simple questions like "what subatomic particles make up an atom?". this is too easy, they thought.   once they've reached the final question, the two guys' jaw hung loose as they read "for 90 points, specify which tire went flat yesterday."	1

the lion’s birthday is coming up and he wants entertainment. so he tells the zebra to find the funniest animal in the whole kingdom. in order to do this the zebra decides to hold a competition in which animals will have to compete in front of a judge. whoever the first one to makemake the judge laugh wins and will perform for the lion.  so the first thing the zebra does is look for the most serious animal. he walks up to a tortoise and asks, “hey tortoise, i’m holding a competition and all you have to do is sit there and laugh if you find an animal to be funny. will you do it?”  the tortoise responds, “...yes.”  the day of the competition arrives and all the animals have gathered to compete. since this is for the lion, the zebra decides to raise the stakes to ensure every animal delivers their full potential. he says, “animals, your goal is to make the tortoise laugh. if you are able to do so, you win and get to perform for the lion. if you fail to make the tortoise laugh, then you will be killed and become the lion’s meal.”  the competition begins and up first is the monkey. he jumps from tree to tree, does flips, and makes funny noises. the zebra becomes pleased and looks at the tortoise and asks what he thinks, to which the tortoise says, “...” since there is no reaction from the judge, the monkey is killed.  up next is the ostrich. he runs around in circles and is moving his long neck. he jumps and does funny moves. the zebra is once again pleased and turns to see the reaction of the tortoise, which once again is, “...” so there’s nothing the zebra can do and they have the ostrich killed.  this pattern goes on with many of the funniest animals and the zebra becomes worried that they won’t have someone for the lion’s party. all of a sudden the next animal approaches, the hippopotamus. the zebra knows that he won’t be able to perform any fun tricks and just as he’s about to have him killed, he hears a chuckle from the tortoise. that chuckle turns into full blown roars of laughter. the zebra is bewildered and asks the tortoise, “hey what’s so funny? he hasn’t done anything! he is literally just standing there!”   the tortoise responds, “haha, wow that monkey was hilarious!”	1

a student never turns in his homework because his dog keeps eating it. after moving to online classes, the teacher thought he finally wouldn’t have an excuse. because of the global pandemic, the teacher had to move the assignments online. thinking of this student, she thought that he surely wouldn’t have an excuse anymore and would finally have to turn an assignment in.   but after the assignment was due and the teacher was done grading, she noticed that the student still hadn’t turned in the assignment. she emailed him to find out why he still wasn’t doing his homework, to which she received the usual reply that his dog ate his homework.   the teacher thought she had finally caught him in the act! she was curious as to why he would tell such an obvious lie, so she responded back and asked how that could still be, as the assignment was completely online.   the student responded, “i’m sorry this keeps happening, but i can still turn in the first few problems if you want. i managed to stop my dog after the first few bytes.”	1

a tourist in ireland goes into a local pub and orders a pint... while sitting at the bar he gets into conversation with the barman and learns that it's a really close community who often meet and enjoy time together at the pub. as they talk, a local stands up and the bar goes silent. "twenty four!" he calls out, before sitting back down, to which the establishment reacts with laughing and smirking. bewildered, but accepting hes foreign to the culture the tourist contiues with his drink, when he realises that another regular has stood up, again to silence. "fourty one!" the pub again was filled with the laughter and giggling of those who understood what was going on. even more confused, the tourist called over the bartender and asked what on earth was going on. "oh, that." the bartender responded. "the locals her are all so familiar with each other that when they say jokes  they don't need to repeat the whole thing. each joke has a number and they just say that."  "really?" the tourist was impressed. "do you think i could try?" "of course, you've seen how it's done." nervous, the tourist got to his feet, unsure of what to say. silence exaggerated his anxiety. "ninety three!" he called out, to which the pub exploded with laughter. people were rolling on the floor and choking on their drinks with laughter. the tourist hadn't expected such a great response, he leaned over the bar amidst the noise and said to the barman: "why was the reaction so crazy?" the barman replied: "it's been a while since the folk here have been told a joke they haven't heard before!"	1

a world war ii spitfire pilot is speaking in a church and reminiscing about his war experiences... "in 1942, the situation was really tough. the germans had a very strong air force. i remember one day, i was protecting the bombers and suddenly, out of the clouds, these fokkers appeared!"  there were a few gasps from the parishioners and several of the children began to giggle.  "i looked up and realized that two of the fokkers were directly above me! i aimed at the first one and shot him down. by then, though, the other fokker was right on my tail!"  at this point, several of the elderly ladies of the church were blushing with embarrassment, the girls were all giggling and the boys laughing loudly.  the pastor finally stands up and says, "i think i should point out that, 'fokker' was the name of a german-dutch aircraft company, who made many of the planes used by the germans during the war."  "yes, that's true." says the old pilot. "but these fokkers were flying messerschmitts!"	1

a father is listening to his daughter say her prayers before bed. the daughter says “god bless mummy and god bless daddy and god bless grandma and good bye grandad.” the father says, “good bye grandad? why is that?” the daughter says, “just because i felt like it.” the next day, grandad drops dead. the father can’t believe the coincidence, but decided not to question it. that night, he listens to the daughter’s prayers again. she says, “god bless mummy and god bless daddy and goodbye grandma.” the father is shocked again and asks his daughter why, but she says again, “just because i felt like it.” the next day, the grandma drops dead and now the father is getting worried but doesn’t know what to do, so he tries to forget about it. that night, he listens to his daughter again and she says, “god bless mummy and goodbye daddy.” the father is now terrified and goes to work the next day sweating, cancels all of his meetings, and hides in his office for the whole day. he doesn’t go home and stays there until midnight. he’s very surprised. ‘i’ve cheated death!’ he thinks to himself, then rushes home. his wife asks, “where have you been?!” and the husband says, “oh don’t ask me any questions, today’s been miserable.” the wife replies, “your days been miserable? well, listen to my day! firstly, the milk man drops dead on the porch…”	1

a man dies he died tragically and unexpectedly in a botched robbery. devastated, his wife cindy mourned four several months, leaving the house only to pick up groceries that her doting mother leaves on her doorstep.  the only comfort to her grief was his cat, who is similarly distraught. after several months of grieving, she realized she couldn't go on like this. she organized a funeral for her husband.  the funeral was somber, her husband, mac, was a well-liked guy, and it was a close-knit community.  the funeral finished with a long, passionate, and emotional speech by mac's wife.  &#x200b;  it truly moved everyone to tears. after she was done, she stepped aside, then asked, "does anyone have a word or two they'd like to say?"  a man she'd never seen before stands up, his face shadowed by his cowboy hat. slowly, solemnly, and with a strong southern accent, he said "plethora", tipped his hat, then sat back down.  cindy choked back tears, and let out a sob.  tears rolled from her eyes like the boulder after indiana jones.  "thank you, so much, stranger. that means a lot"	1

"what happened?!" she asked, running to him.  he waved her closer, and whispered, "shot through the heart, and you're to blame. darling, you gave love a bad name."	1

there was once a musician in north korea one day, kim jong un himself calls the musician and asks him to direct a concert for his entertainment. not daring to say no to the supreme leader, he agreed.  so the man assembled the best orchestra in all of korea to play the piece he composed for the leader. however when it was time to perform, the orchestra was horrible, everything was off pitch and no one seemed to have any rhythm.  displeased, kim ordered for the man to be executed. when asked what his final meal was to be, the man replied "i want a curry so spicy my eyes will melt." the man ate the curry and began tearing up at how spicy it was, and it was time for him to be executed.  he was sat down in the chair and the switch was pulled. sparks flew and smoke quickly filled the room, but the man appeared to be completely unharmed!  surprised by this miracle, the supreme leader says "alright, i'll give you another chance to entertain me" and the man quickly went to work composing another masterpiece.  again he assembled the best orchestra in all of korea and went before the leader to perform, but this time the orchestra performed even worse, by far the worst music to ever hit the leader's ears.  so kim jong un again orders for the man to be executed and again he was asked for what his final meal was to be. "i want the spiciest curry in all of korea" and the guards complied and gave the man the spiciest curry he'd ever eaten, even spicier than the last.  the man was then sat down in the chair and the switch was pulled. again sparks flew and smoke filled the room, but again the man was completely fine!  "alright," says the supreme leader, "i will give you 1 last chance to impress me" and the man went back to work. for a third time he assembled the best orchestra in all of korea and went to perform in front of the leader.  but once again it was horrible, so bad in fact that kim had to cover his ears to block it out. so once again the man was ordered to be put to death.  "very well," said the man, "for my final meal i wish for the spiciest curry in the entire world."  "no," said the supreme leader, "i have had it with your magical curry, you will be put straight to death." and so the man was strapped into the chair and this time the switch was pulled by none other than the supreme leader himself.  sparks flew and smoke filled the room but the man still remained untouched! "what?!?!" exclaimed the leader. "but how, you didn't eat any curry."  "oh no no no sir, it was never about the curry," said the man,  "i'm just a poor conductor."	1

"well, peter, it looks like heaven is getting full today. only let in people who have really good stories about how they died."  used to this, peter nodded.  the first soul approached the gates, and peter stopped him, saying "unfortunately, heaven is a little full today. you'll have to tell me the story of how you died, and if it's not good enough, you'll have to wait until there is more space."  the man nodded, saying "well, i had been thinking my wife was cheating on me for awhile. so i got home from work early, to try and catch her in the act. she was home, and seemed shocked to see me. i stormed through the apartment, searching for anyone she might have been with. i heard a man's voice calling from the balcony, and went to investigate. a man was hanging from the railing of my 49th floor apartment. in a rage, i began beating on his hands. he did not let go, so i went to get a baseball bat. he finally let go, and i watched him fall and land on some bushes, surviving. even more angered, i went inside, grabbed the fridge, carried it to the balcony, threw it over and crushed the man to death. all that work and anger caused me to have a heart attack, and now i'm here."  st. peter looked at the man and nodded. "that's a good story, you're welcome to enter heaven."  the next man walked up, and st. peter gave him the same spiel. the shook him head, sadly. "i was doing yoga on the balcony of my 50th floor apartment, when i slipped on my water bottle and fell over the railing of my balcony. i managed to grab hold of the railing below me, and called for help for what seemed like hours. eventually a man came out and started beating on my hands. i screamed at him to stop, but he just went inside and came back with a bat. i couldn't hold on, and fell. i landed on some bushes, and as i was thanking god for letting me survive, i opened my eyes just as a fridge fell out of the sky, killing me. and now i'm here."  st. peter nodded appreciatively. "your story is quite good, my child. you may enter heaven."  the next man approached peter, and received the spiel. the man looks to his left, then to his right, then back to peter, with a smile.  "so get this, i'm hiding inside a refridgerator..."	1

"drill 7 holes on the seat."  the devil did just that.  the idiot then sat on the chair and let out a very loud fart.  standing up, he asked, "which hole did my fart come out from ?"  the devil inspected the seat and said, "the third hole from the right."

a man walks into a bar he's never visited before, and settles down to order a drink.  before long, he notices someone sitting in the corner - a man who appears normal in every regard except that his head is a gigantic orange. curious, the newcomer asks the bartender "what's up with the guy in the corner? the one with the-" but the bartender interrupts and says "honestly, your best bet is just to buy him a drink and ask him yourself."  so the newcomer buys two drinks and wanders over to the table in the corner. the man with a gigantic orange for a head looks up, sighs, and says "let me guess. you're here to ask about my head being a gigantic orange, aren't you?" the newcomer replies "i'm sorry but i was just so curious", and he hands over the drink.  the man with a gigantic orange for a head shrugs and begins his story: "when i was a younger man, desperate for money, i would spend my days wandering the beach with a metal detector trying to find coins or scrap to sell. one day i found a strange object - an old oil lamp. i scooped the sand away and dusted the lamp off as best i could, and the lamp started to glow with an unearthly light. before i could blink, a genie stood before me, majestic and bold!"  the newcomer looks skeptical. "a genie?" he says, "yeah right!"  the man with a gigantic head for an orange just holds a hand up and continues with the story: "the genie promised me three wishes - anything i could desire! i thought long and hard, because i had read the tales of tricksy genies who would twist your words to change your wish into a dreadful curse. after pondering for an hour, i made my first wish - i wished to be so wealthy that i could live lavishly for my entire life without working another day, and the wealth must be my own wealth, obtained through both legal and ethical means. the genie simply nodded and when i checked my bank balance on my phone, it showed a balance of billions of dollars! i was instantly one of the wealthiest people in the world, and as far as i know the genie hadn't twisted my wish."  "very clever," says the newcomer, "but that doesn't explain why your head is a gigantic orange! that's the part that i'm really interested in!"  "i'm getting to it," replies the man with a gigantic orange for a head. he orders another drink, and once the next round arrives he continues his story: "for my second wish, i still needed to make sure the genie couldn't twist my words against me. i worked for *two* hours to get the phrasing just right! having found the right words, so careful that the genie couldn't find a loophole, i made my second wish - i wished to be loved by, and to love in return, the most perfect woman i could ever meet - suited to me physically, mentally, and emotionally. the genie simply nodded, and suddenly a beautiful woman came running down the beach toward me. she instantly declared her love for me, and we started dating - in fact, we're still happily married today, and she's just as beautiful and kind and passionate as the day i met her. as far as i know, the genie hadn't twisted my wish."  "wow, that's a lovely part of the story," says the newcomer. "i'm glad it worked out well for you, but again i really must insist - please can you get to the part that explains why your head is a gigantic orange?!"  "don't rush me," says the man with a gigantic orange for a head. starting to slur a little, he calls for another drink. once the bartender drops the drink at the table, the man with a gigantic orange for a head continues: "you've been asking about why my head is a gigantic orange, and here's where you get your answer. as you've heard, for my other wishes i was so careful, i spent *hours* thinking of the right thing to say, and those wishes brought me more happiness than you could ever know, but for my third wish... well, the third wish is where i made a foolish mistake. i'll regret it until the day i die, i can't *believe* i did something so stupid! you see, for the third wish, i wished my head was a gigantic orange."	1

the saga of max mallory and mark kensington were two star struck lovers who had been married for 12 years. mallory was a commercial airline pilot and mark was the captain of a nuclear submarine. they were both very responsible with their money, lived simply, had no children, and no vices. the only exception to their frugality was their dog max whom they doted on at every possible occasion.   unfortunately for max, fate had terrible plans in store for him. one dark august day, mallory and mark were both at their respective jobs and in a cruel twist of fate suffered major mechanical failures at the same time. in a million to one oddity, they both perished in the astonishing first-of-its-kind airplane/submarine accident.  the funeral was a simple affair, but it was the reading of the will that shocked the attendees; everything they owned had been left to max. the kensington family was understandably upset about this, and within a few months time, the lawyers had finagled their way through to screwing max over with little thought to his feelings. shortly thereafter, unloved, unwanted, and alone… max had been cast out onto the streets of new york penniless. as you can imagine, this was a real hardship for max.  max, destitute, wandered for weeks before he finally settled down on the corner of 5th and main. he found a “comfortable” cardboard box to live in, and his friend hobo jones was relatively sane. now for max, this whole new life was a real hardship, and difficult to adjust to but… he persevered. a few months later, while talking to hobo jones, he learned that there was a dog show in town. while an unattended dog at a show may be slightly unusual, max thought it just might be possible for him to improve his lot in life… there was a cash prize!  at the dog show, max was suitably impressive. he had bathed in the local gutter with hobo jones’ help, and positively glowed with a hint of the radiance that he once had under the care of the kensingtons. the judges muttered among themselves every time they saw him and to a man they decided to award max first place.   ecstatic, max approached the judges’ panel. unfortunately, dog show judges aren’t the most scrupulous of people, and they kept the money, only giving max his trophy. what dog can complain about being cheated? faced with yet another hardship, max lugged his trophy home, whilst the judges had a wild night on the town with the cash that was supposed to go to the winner.  hobo jones comforted max when he got back. “max, it’s ok. i know you got screwed, but hey you got this really neat trophy and at least you’re qualified for the city-wide dog show! maybe the judges will be better there, and you can really move up.”  max considered this good advice, and while his hardships seemed overwhelming at times, hobo jones had made a fair point. for the next month, max trained himself like never before. he exercised regularly, worked his fur into a grand sheen, and all around just persevered. the day of the city-wide show came around and he was excited. he trotted down to the performance hall, and quickly impressed everyone in attendance. by time the second round of judging had occurred, he was considered a favorite to win, and by the final round of judging, he was the clear victor. ecstatic, he rushed to claim his prize.  i don’t wish to dishearten you or cast a pallor on the integrity of dog show judges everywhere but… max was just cursed by hardships. the judges at this particular show were, if anything, more corrupt than the previous judges. max received his trophy, and accolades rang from all but the cash was sadly lacking. these judges liked vegas more than they liked dogs, and the prize money that no human could claim would get them there in style. max, heartbroken, trudged home through the pouring rain dragging his (rather large) trophy behind him.  to the rescue came hobo jones. max’s distressed demeanor was lightened by his antics and encouragement. after all, it was true that he had qualified for the state championships. besides, max was practically creating a name for himself in the dog show world… two overwhelming victories with no owner? almost preposterous! so, that night, max curled up around his two trophies and considered that maybe his hardships were coming to an end. he wagged his tail a bit before he fell asleep.  this same sorry state of affairs continued for max through state, regional and even the national dog show. when max had just won the national dog show, he should have been living the good life, the $10,000 prize would have bought him quite a bit of comfort. unfortunately, plagued by hardships and corrupt judges, max had nothing but his five trophies to keep him warm at night. with a frustrated shake of his head, max decided to simply focus on how he would get to the international dog show in paris at the end of the year. he decided to see if he could get passage on a ship.  after spending an entire day begging every captain he met on the pier to take him along, max was beginning to despair. nobody seemed to want a dog underfoot, regardless of how useful he may be. luckily though, he decided to try one last ship. it was an old thing, and looked like it had come straight out of a story book. it was a ship that had clearly seen better days, and was in fact astonishing for it’s incongruity amongst other more modern ships… it even had sails! max trotted up to the grizzled old sea captain and bade him good afternoon. astonishingly, max’s luck seemed to take a turn right away for the captain immediately lit up and started chatting like they had been old friends his whole life. within an hour, max had secured passage to paris (provided he work during transit) and had found a new friend.  the following morning, max took his leave of hobo jones and boarded the ship. for many months they sailed and had many grand adventures, but this story is not about those. suffice it to say that the captain and max grew very fond of one another, and they shared many stories of hardships that each at faced. when they finally reached paris, the captain promised to wait for max, and wished him good luck at the show. this was it! the international dog show that max had been preparing for for so many months. he strutted in confidently and was greeted with uproarious applause… he was practically famous now! the dog with no owner, the champion extraordinaire. round after round of judging, dog after dog was eliminated. finally, it came down to just two dogs, max and another yorkshire named augustus winthrop the third.   the judges whispered amongst themselves for an eternity. as you well know, the prize for the international dog show is nothing to sneeze at. it well exceeds thousands of pounds, and could set all of max’s hardships aside for the duration of his life. unfortunately, human greed being what it is and max’s lack of human company being what it was… he never had a chance. with yet another cruel laugh from the fates, the judges awarded max the title of champion dog, the trophy, the accolades, and… not the money. max faced with yet another hardship, lugged the huge trophy back to the ship, and sadly went to his bunk. tired out, and depressed, he promptly fell asleep. the captain, knowing what had occurred the moment he saw max arrive, decided to leave immediately and cursed the judges heartily as they sailed out of port.  several hours later, a freak storm blew up. sailors were cursing, the captain was wide-eyed with stress, and max was awoken by the noise. he scampered to deck just in time to notice a sailor caught in the rigging trying to bring down one of the sails. without pausing a moment to think, max bounded up the rigging and immediately helped the sailor free, chewing through the ropes that had ensnared him. he let the sailor down first and was about to follow suit when a sudden wave rocked the ship violently and the worst happened. max lost his grip.  max fell.  max hit the deck.  max didn’t move.  in one of those weird little moments of life, the sudden fury of the world paused. the sailors all gasped, shocked. the captain turned his eyes towards max. nobody moved. nothing moved. they all prayed silently for the poor dog, hoping against hope that he would rise once more. the spell was broken by the first mate who took a step forward, then another, another… tears were appearing in his eyes. then, miracle of miracles… max got up. he was fine! the sailors all cheered, shouting for joy.   the first mate, astonished, turned to the captain and said, “captain, how could max survive a fall like that?”  “don’t you know?” said the captain, unsurprised in the least, “he was used to hard ships.”	1

bubba joe is a down to earth farm boy from east texas and falls in love with a girl after some time, they decide to get married, but before that can happen his fiance tells him that he must become christian. now bubba joe was never really religious but he really loves this girl and heads off to the local catholic church and asks the priest if he can become a parishioner. the priest welcomes him but says in order to join the church he must tell him where jesus was born. now bubba joe had never really travelled much and had never even gotten outside of texas. after thinking a bit, he replies "was it dallas?", at which the priest is aghast but gathers himself and says, "bubba joe i'm sorry but our parishioners must be knowledgeable about jesus' life, why don't you try the methodist church down the street?" determined not to let his fiance down, bubba joe goes there and the priest there asks him the same question. bubba joe recalled jesus being from a small town and replies," father, was it tyler?" the methodist priest is also taken aback but composes himself and says, "i'm sorry bubba joe but why don't you try the baptist church, they take everyone in as long you believe in god." feeling defeated a little, but glad that he now has a solution, he heads to the baptist church where the pastor there asks him, "bubba joe do you believe in god?" to which he responds, "yes father, i do," and the pastor responds with, "well then you will be attain salvation by the grace of god!"   glad that he has now fulfilled his fiance's request but still confused as to where jesus was from, bubba joe asks the pastor the question to which he responds, "oh that's easy, jesus was born in palestine." bubba joe slaps his knee and says "i knew jesus was born in east texas!"	1

the bee story    i hadn't put my own picture up on my dating profile, just a picture of my pickup. but that's okay, because she'd just put a picture of her dog. i sent her a message, something almost-clever like "your dog can ride in my pickup any time," and she responded.  we clicked pretty quickly, and started chatting regularly. every day, sometimes throughout the day. slowly we learned more about each other. her dog's name was daisy. my truck's name was dodge ram (i apologized for my lack of creativity). she was a cpa. i was a beekeeper.  and at this, she stumbled. "if we ever meet in real-life, i want you to know that i could never date a beekeeper." but we were still far away from that point, so it was moot.  but time went on, and we gradually became closer to that point. more personal information. what firm she worked for. where my farm was. names of relatives. names of high schools. all the things that just come up in conversation eventually if you talk to someone long enough.  but, oddly, after all this time, neither of us had thought to send any pictures. until one day i got a message from her: "i never thought i'd say this, but i really do want to meet you in person. i think we have a rare connection, and i don't want to squander it. i want to send you my picture, and i want you to send me yours, but i'm telling you, i can never date a beekeeper."  i couldn't imagine a life without my bees. but i also couldn't imagine a life without her. tentatively, reluctantly, i clicked on the image attached to her message.  then i saw her face. now i'm a bee leaver.	1

a man sees an ad, which promises the client to loose either 5, 10 or 20 pounds in one day but doesn't mention any kind of method. so, since he is curious to how the company wants to achieve that, he calls them and purchases the first and cheapest offer, which states that he will loose 5 pounds in a day. the next day a pretty lady shows up. she is wearing nothing but sport shoes and a sign that says : “catch me and you can do wathever you want to me“. without thinking twice, he runs after her, but since she is quite athletic that takes some time. finally after an hour, he catches her and they fuck. the next day he weighs himself and is pleased to see that he really lost 5 pounds.  a few days after he deceides to call again and purchase the more expensive offer that states that you will loose 10 pounds in a day. long story short, the next day a even more charming lady shows up, wearing nothing but shoes and the sign, but she is also more athletic than the first one and so he chases her for 3 hours, catches her and they fuck. again, as promised he looses the 10 pounds.  fast forward a few days more, and he deceides to purchase the most expensive offer, in hopes for a even more gorgeous lady. the next day, as expected, his bell rings again. he already is dressed in his sport clothes and cannot wait to chase the last lady. as he opens the door though, much to his suprise, there isn't a barely covered lady, but a barely covered, 6'4“ tall, buff man, who is also quite well hung. he as well wears sport shoes and a sign, which says: “i'm gay and if i catch you, i can do to you whatever i want. you get a headstart of 10 seconds“	1

two boys were misbehaving... ...so their mother went to the local priest to look for advice. the priest thought it would be best if the boys learned integrity, by way of understanding that "god is everywhere, and he sees everything you do so you shouldn't misbehave."  the mother and the priest thought it best that the priest talked to the boys, so the mother agreed to take the boys in one at a time to talk to the priest.     she brought the first boy (ray) to the church and left the second boy (jim) at home. she took ray into the priest's office and stayed outside while the priest and ray talked.     "where is god?" the priest calmly asked expecting to make the point that "god is everywhere". ray, petrified, said nothing. so the priest asked again slightly louder, "where is god?!". ray still said nothing. so the priest stood up and slammed his hands on the desk yelling, "where is god?!?!". ray stood up and ran out of the office, past his mother, and ran all the way home.     he came screaming in the front door and ran straight to jim's room. he opened the door and said, "god is missing and they think we took him!".	1

a rather attractive woman goes up to the bar in a quiet rural pub. she gestures alluringly to the barman who comes over immediately. when he arrives, she gently steps with her high heels on the bar stool and plops herself on the bar top, crosses her legs, and seductively signals that he should bring his face close to hers. when he does so, she begins to gently caress his beard which is full and bushy.  are you the manager?" she asks, softly stroking his face with both hands. "actually, no" he replies. "can you get him for me - i need to speak to him?" she asks, running her hands up beyond his beard and into his hair. "i'm afraid i can't" breathes the barman - clearly aroused. "is there anything i can do?" "yes there is. i need you to give him a message" she continues huskily, popping a couple of fingers into his mouth and allowing him to suck them gently.  "tell him that there is no toilet paper in the ladies room."	1

2 slabs of concrete walk into a bar.. they sit down and start discussing how tough they are, until the barman asks what they want.  concrete 1: i'll have a pint, and a shot of tequila, because i'm hard! i'm tough and can handle anything!  so the barman gets his drinks and asks the second.  concrete 2: me? i'll have 2 pints, and 2 shots of tequila! because i'm even harder!   the barman complies and makes the drinks.  a few more moments pass with the barman listening to the 2 discussing who's the most tough, when suddenly the door opens and a tiny piece of tarmac walks through the door.  both slabs of concrete quickly jump behind the bar and cower, shaking, and hide.  the tarmac walks up to the bar, and softly orders a small orange juice, drinks it then leaves, and the 2 slabs of concrete come back out from behind the bar.  the barman notices all this and says " hold on, i thought you 2 were the toughest around? yet, terrified of that tiny piece of tarmac??"  concrete 1 replies " we may be tough yes, but the tarmac....that guys a cycle path!"	1

one time there was a man with no money. he got a job as a train conductor. one day he walked up to a man on the train and shot him point-blank and stole his money.  well, when everyone got off the train he was immediately arrested. he got sentenced to death by the judge and went to be executed by electric chair.  the executioner gave him his last meal, put him in the chair, and connected the wires. he pulled the switch, and nothing happened!  the law said the conductor was dead, so they had to release him.  well, he went back to work, and got a job as conductor again! this time, he shot two men on the train and robbed them.   he was sentenced to death again, and the jail technicians were brought in to make sure the chair worked this time. the executioner gave him his last meal, and he pulled the switch.   once again, nothing happened! they released him as the law required.  this time, he got a job as a conductor once again. he robbed and killed three men this time!   the judge sentenced him to death, they checked the chair even better this time, and they gave him his last meal. the executioner pulled the switch one more time.   it failed again! not so much as a hair moved on his body. before they released him, the executioner asked why he killed the men.   "well, i don't have any money!", he replied.  "and why won't you die when we electrocute you?", the executioner asked.  "i told you, sir. i'm just a poor conductor!"	1

a teacher and his students are in the anatomy class. it's the first class of the semester, and everyone is eager to learn.   the professor starts "the first thing one has to do to become a good doctor is to be a good observant. the second one is to never, ever feel disgusted by anything."  after this observation, the teacher leads the students to the autopsy room, where there is a dead dog on a table.  "let's do our first test. everybody must do exactly what i'll do. did i make myself clear? exactly the same thing."  that being said, the teacher sticks his finger in the dog's butthole, licking it soon after. the students are disgusted by the scene but have to follow the teacher's instructions. each of them sticks their fingers in the dog's butthole and then lick their fingers. obviously, everyone's pretty pissed and disgusted.  "i want to congratulate you for your effort. that's essential to become a good doctor."  "however, you need to improve your observation skills. i stuck one finger in the butthole and licked another one."	1

a man comes home to his apartment to find his wife in bed, naked now, he's already suspected her of cheating for some time, and coming home to see his wife naked in her bed set him off like a bull.  "where is that fucker!!!!" he shouts at her, wildly scrambling around the room, looking in every hiding spot his mind can think of.  he suddenly runs out to his balcony, ten floors above-ground, he sees a pair of hands hanging from the edge of his porch- it's him. the guy who fucked his wife. immediately he kicks the hands off of the balcony, as the man falls, though landed on a bush so he's still alive.  enraged, the husband grabbed his fridge and chucked it over- crushing the man by the bush with a sickly thud. the husband then jumped off and killed himself.  there were three spirits that went up to the gates of heaven. an angel looks at the three and turns to the first- "hello, spirits! welcome to heaven! how did you die?"  "well," the first spirit responds, "i came home from work early to find my wife in bed naked. she was cheating on me with some fucking idiot, who i found hanging off my balcony, and threw a fridge down at him, killing myself after."  "interesting," the angel notes, turning to the second spirit. "so, how did you die?"  "you're not gonna believe this but," the second spirit says, a little jittery. "i was sunbathing on my apartment balcony around midday- when suddenly i dropped my phone! as i went to grab it i slipped and fell! i would've died if i didn't manage to grab on to the balcony directly below. i started trying to climb up and heard footsteps, someone was coming to help me! then i just went flying into a bush as he kicked me off! luckily i survived. i was about to try and get up when i saw a giant fridge skyrocketing towards me, and i ended up here."  "wow, that's fascinating!" the angel says, turning to the third spirit. "so, how did you die?"  "heh," the third spirit laughs. "i was fucking this really hot girl and then heard the door open- so i ran to a fridge and hid. the next thing i know it's fucking flying!"	1

4 men at a bar discuss the most difficult sport to play. the first man, wide as a dishwasher and having huge muscles all over, says “i’m a football player, it’s the hardest sport in the world to play! you’ve gotta be in top physical condition and have excellent situational awareness.”  the second man, an older gentleman wearing a collared shirt, says “sorry champ, but the actual hardest sport to play is golf. every swing of the club is a calculated symphony of body mechanics; the mental fortitude you need is unreal!”  the third man, adorned in a gray peacoat, says “gentleman, i have played in chess tournaments across 3 continents, and i can assure you that chess is the most difficult sport of all. you need to memorize and recall 30,000 moves before you can even face a college team!”  they all drink and then turn their attention to the fourth man who had baggy eyes and calloused fingers.  the football player says “what do you do?”  the man replies, “well i’m a cricket player.”  “i’m sure you think cricket is the hardest thing to play then?”  man says, “you bet your ass it is, you know how hard it is to get those things to chirp on key?”	1

long : an elderly man on a moped, looking about 100 years old, pulls up next to a doctor at a street light. &#x200b;  looking at the shiny car ,the old man asks the doctor "what ya driving there sonny?  the doctor replies, “1500+hp porsche.  it cost half a million dollars!       'why does it cost so much?' says the old man.     'because this car can do up to 320 miles an hour!' states the doctor proudly.     the moped driver asks, 'mind if i take a look inside?'     'no problem,' replies the doctor.     so the old man pokes his head in the window and looks around.      'that's a pretty nice car, all right... but i'll stick with my moped!' said the old man.     just then the light changes, and the doctor decides to show the old man just what his car can do.     he floors it, and within 30 seconds    the speedometer reads 160 mph.     suddenly, he notices a dot in his rear view mirror. it seems to be getting closer!     he slows down to see what it could be and suddenly whoossshhh !     the old man whips by him going much faster!     how the hell is he going faster than my porsche?' the doctor asks himself.     amazed that the moped could pass his porsche, he gives it more gas    and passes the moped at 275 mph    and he looks in his mirror and sees the old man gaining on him again and whoosssh! the old man passes him.  astounded by the speed of this old guy,   he floors the gas pedal and takes the sports-car all the way up to 320 mph.     not ten seconds later, he sees the moped bearing down on him again!   the porsche is flat out, and there's nothing he can do!     suddenly, the moped plows into the back of his porsche, demolishing the rear end.     the doctor stops and jumps out and unbelievably the old man is still alive.     he runs up to the banged-up old guy and says, 'i'm a doctor.... is there anything i can do for you?'     the old man whispers,     'unhook my suspenders from your side view mirror!'.	1

nine medical tests you can do yourself wander into the back garden and piss on your neighbour’s fence (again).   if it dries quickly, you have high sodium (salt) levels and pending heart problems.  if it attracts ants your sugar level is too high and you might be diabetic.  if your piss is dark and of limited quantity, you are dehydrated.  if your stream didn’t reach the fence, you have a prostrate problem.   if it is bright pink you have kidney problems.   if you forgot to get your knob out and you pissed your pants, you have alzheimer’s.   if you missed the fence you have parkinson’s.   if your stream smells meaty, your cholesterol level is far too high.   if you can’t smell your urine, you have coronavirus.    have a good day.	1

(nsfw) so two men are standing in front of an elevator waiting for it to arrive. one man is a very skinny fellow standing at barely 5 foot 5 and maybe on a good day could manage to come to 90 pounds soaking wet. the other man is a colossus of a human being that looks like he runs out of weights to put on at the gym and that he could tear entire phone books in half. the large man notices the scrawny one staring at him to which he turns to him and says “6 foot 3, 270 pounds, 40 pound right testicle, 40 point left testicle, 15 inch unit, turner brown.” after hearing this the scrawny man instantly faints. as he slowly wakes he sees the large man helping him and asks him “what happened, why did you faint? all i did was tell you what i tell everyone else when they see me and that’s that i’m 6 foot 3, 270 pounds with a 40 point right testicle and a 40 pound left testicle along with a 15 inch unit and that my name is turner brown.” after hearing this the skinny man looks relieved and says “oh thank god, i got the first part but at the end i thought you said turn around.”	1

a man wakes up a man wakes up in a dimly lit room with three doors. on each door, there is a picture of a different type of food. the first door has a picture of eggs, second has a picture of cereal and the third has a picture of beans.   the man decides to try the first door, so he opens it. behind it is a beautiful woman with three eggs for breasts. she says, “egg tits? you can have as much as you like!” of course, the man accepts. the woman could make her chest transform into any kind of dish as long as it was only eggs. omelets, deviled, poached, scrambled, of the man could name it, it would be there. however, the food was never seasoned, so it always tasted a bit dull.   he eats nothing but eggs for a solid month and has great sex with the triple breasted woman almost every six hours, but soon, he gets bored of the same meal and same woman. so, he decides to open the second door.   behind the second door, there lies an even more beautiful woman, but this time she has two literal jugs on her chest filled with cereal. “jug tits?” the new woman asked. she had hardly finished her sentence before the man was on top of her, eating. the man has never been happier in his life, not that he could remember anything before he got to the mysterious room. the woman, like the last one, could create any type of cereal he wanted. lucky charms, trix, honey bunches of oats, even certain types of granola were manageable.   the next two and a half months, the man eats eggs and cereal while he searches for a way out, never deciding to open the third door as to not add a new food to his palate so he doesn’t get bored. however, the room seems impenetrable.   the morning of the fourth week, the man wakes up and the eggs and cereal are tasteless. the man wished that there could be some milk to go with the cereal or some bacon for the eggs, but alas the women could only conjure up their specific item. after a while, the women grew unhappy with him and begged him to open the third door. they said that maybe there would be a way out.   the man sighed, despaired, and knew he had waited long enough, so finally, he threw open the third and final door, labeled beans. the woman inside had one can of beans for a breast and she smiled at the man. the man screamed, “oh my god! not another one of you! i can’t handle any more of this! can this get any worse?”  the woman replied, grinning, “can tit?”	1

and then the fight started . . . my wife sat down on the couch next to me as i was flipping channels.  she asked, 'what's on tv?'  i said, 'dust.'     and then the fight started...   ----------  my wife and i are watching "who wants to be a millionaire" while we were in bed.  i turned to her and said, "do you want to have sex?"  "no," she answered.  i then said, "is that your final answer?"  she didn't even look at me this time, simply saying, "yes."  so i said, "then i'd like to phone a friend."  and then the fight started...  ----------  saturday morning i got up early, quietly dressed, made my lunch, grabbed the dog, and slipped quietly into the garage. i hooked up the boat up to the truck, and proceeded to back out into a torrential downpour. the wind was blowing 50 mph, so i pulled back into the garage, turned on the radio, and discovered that the weather would be bad all day.  i went back into the house, quietly undressed, and slipped back into bed. i cuddled up to my wife's back, now with a different anticipation, and whispered, "the weather out there is terrible."  my loving wife of 10 years replied, "can you believe my stupid husband is out fishing in that?"  and then the fight started...  ----------  i rear-ended a car this morning. so, there we were alongside the road and slowly the other driver got out of his car. you know how sometimes you just get soooo stressed and little things just seem funny? yeah, well i couldn't believe it.... he was a dwarf!!!  he stormed over to my car, looked up at me, and shouted, "i am not happy !!!"  so, i looked down at him and said, "well, then which one are you?"  and then the fight started...  ----------  my wife was hinting about what she wanted for our upcoming anniversary.  she said, 'i want something shiny that goes from 0 to 150 in about 3 seconds.'  i bought her a bathroom scale.  and then the fight started...   ----------  when i got home last night, my wife demanded that i take her someplace expensive.  so, i took her to a gas station.  and then the fight started...   ----------  after retiring, i went to the social security office to apply for social security. the woman behind the counter asked me for my driver's license to verify my age. i looked in my pockets and realized i had left my wallet at home. i told the woman that i was very sorry, but i would have to go home and come back later.  the woman said, 'unbutton your shirt'. so i opened my shirt revealing my curly silver hair. she said, 'that silver hair on your chest is proof enough for me' and she processed my social security application.  when i got home, i excitedly told my wife about my experience at the social security office.   she said, 'you should have dropped your pants. you might have gotten disability, too.'   and then the fight started...  ----------  my wife and i were sitting at a table at my high school reunion, and i kept staring at a drunken lady swigging her drink as she sat alone at a nearby table.   my wife asked, 'do you know her?'   'yes,' i sighed, 'she's my old girlfriend. i understand she took to drinking right after we split up those many years ago, and i hear she hasn't been sober since.'   'my god!' says my wife, 'who would think a person could go on celebrating that long?'   and then the fight started...  ----------  i took my wife to a restaurant. the waiter, for some reason, took my order first.     "i'll have the strip steak, medium rare, please."  he said, "aren't you worried about the mad cow?"  "nah, she can order for herself."   and then the fight started...   ----------  a woman is standing nude, looking in the bedroom mirror.  she is not happy with what she sees and says to her husband, 'i feel horrible; i look old, fat and ugly.  i really need you to pay me a compliment.'   the husband replies, 'your eyesight's damn near perfect.'   and then the fight started...	1

the horse and the chicken a horse and a chicken are playing in a meadow. the horse falls into a mud hole and is sinking. he calls to the chicken to go and get the farmer to help pull him out to safety. the chicken runs to the farm but the farmer can't be found. so he drives the farmer's bmw back to the mud hole and ties some rope around the bumper. he then throws the other end of the rope to his friend, the horse, and drives the car forward saving him from sinking! a few days later, the chicken and horse were playing in the meadow again and the chicken falls into the mud hole. the chicken yelled to the horse to go and get some help from the farmer. the horse said, "i think i can stand over the hole!" so he stretched over the width of the hole and said, "grab my penis and pull yourself up." so the chicken did and pulled himself to safety. moral of the story: if you're hung like a horse, you don't need a bmw to pick up chicks.	1

i was driving in the desert in my 1989 jeep wrangler. i was going for a drive in the vast, dry deserts of nevada. i had just gotten in a fight with my wife, and yes, i might have had a little too much to drink and a little too poor a sense of direction to be doing what i was doing. cacti and tumbleweeds blurred past me as i tried my best to ignore the clunking sound coming out from under the old wrangler's hood. one stretch of road blended into the next. as the road got bumpier, i realized i wasn't even on a road after all, but rather wandering the desert on an uncharted course.  *slortch!* a sickening crunch sent me and my battered mount spiraling and screeching over the coarse, sandy dunes. sand got everywhere. the jeep rammed into a dune with a *thud* and i blacked out.  *"fool of a crook!"* i heard in a thunderous voice. i looked around, panicked. my legs were caught under some jeep guts that had spilled all over me. i couldn't move. *"are all you humans this stupid, or are you an extra rare shiny specimen?"*  "what?! who's there? what's going on?" was all i could spew from my confused mouth.  *"i am na'thwhqangq'yi, though those of your kind often call me nathaniel. do you not know what you nearly crashed into?"*  still looking around, i shrugged. "a wedding party?" i offered. out of the corner of my eye, a slimy silver snake slithered silently into view.   "ahem. do you see any extravagant mate pairings in the vicinity? you're hardly doing anyone any favors."  staring into his beady little eyes, i was shocked to realize that the voice was coming from the snake! it seemed to be some kind of telepathic ability. not only that, he had lowered his voice now that he was closer.  "well, *nate the snake,*" i quipped, "it's not like you've exactly been handing out favors either! what are you, anyway? some kind of area 51 experiment?"  despite the stupidity of my remarks, i heard something like a muffled chuckle. "nate the snake... i like that. what i am is very old, and beyond your mortal understanding. but i have been imprisoned within this serpentine body for the purpose of guarding the terminus obelisk. it is one spoke of a wheel that, when turned, will ignite ancient flames within this planet that will destroy everything on it. and above it. and outside it, in dimensions you cannot imagine."  "huh... and what are the other spokes of this wheel? what does that metaphor even mean?" i asked.  nate the snake scoffed. "it's literally a wheel, pal. see that stick over there? in the mud?"  i looked over at some kind of branch-looking thing protruding from a mud pit nearby. a stick in the mud.   "i'm not your pal, guy! the name's jesse. so... you're telling me if i had hit that switch over there, the entire universe and beyond would have ended?"  nate nodded sagely. "a stick. a switch. an on/off button for existence, if you will, but more of a lever than a button."  i snapped "i'm not will, i'm jesse! pay attention, geez."  again, that stupid sexy chuckle. "well i'm not geez, either! nate the snake, remember?"  "right. by the way, help a pal out and get my legs free, please? i'm not a badass snake like you. i really need to pee."  the car parts holding me down dimly glowed and were lifted from my legs. i thanked nate heartily and tried to get the jeep started. no luck.  finding i was stuck here, in the middle of the desert, i did what any sane man would do: make conversation with nate the snake. i found out he'd been guarding this obelisk thing for centuries. it really didn't look like an "obelisk" to me, though, so i just started calling it the lever of doom, and it stuck.   when i got thirsty, nate was kind enough to lead me to a nearby spring hidden just under a dune that i would have completely missed otherwise. as i drank greedily from the spring, i talked to nate about my life and my problems.  despite coming off as a bit of a jerk at first blush, nate was actually pretty interested in my life. turns out women in lakes handing out swords is no basis for government, but ancient spirits in snakes handing out advice is an excellent basis for turning your life around. we talked for hours and hours about my wife, jamie, how all the little times i pissed her off had added up, how she rearranged my things only because she loved me and wanted to clean up the place.  days passed as i tried to fix the jeep and failed. no cell reception. i had no idea where the nearest town was. nate the snake took pity on me and helped guide me to some wild berries that kept me fed near that mysterious hidden spring. we talked more - about how i felt i was at a dead end at my job, about the career i wanted to pursue and how my manager seemed so much more selfish than other managers in my division. we talked about his abilities, and he showed me some more of the mystical secrets of the desert. he gave me a killer flan recipe. it was all information that i would later take to improve my life immeasurably.  eventually, i found out what was stopping the wrangler from starting. with a few zaps from nate, the engine roared to life.  "i'm going to miss you, nate the snake. i feel like we really connected these past few weeks."  "and i you," nate replied. "but this needn't be goodbye forever. return to this desert, take a left, then a right, and repeat. when you are wandering, when you are lost, you can find me and we can chat once more. however, you must promise ne that you will never tell anyone about the lever of doom."   i took his blessing and warning to heart. can't believe i even got the old coot to call it the lever of doom, too.  and return to him i did. over the years, as he said, whenever i felt lost in life, i would return to the desert, play the left-right game, and find warm-blooded counsel from nate. he helped me find solace after my first divorce; he held me stable when the market crashed and i felt totally responsible for it; i bought some guns and helped him defend the lever of doom from void-faced legions from hell. nate became my dearest friend in life.  one last day, in my hairs of gray, i took one last drive in the deserts of nevada. i drove my 1989 jeep wrangler, repaired multiple times over the years, like i had many times before. as always, i played the left-right game.  i was glad to see nate's figure in the distance as my jeep approached. old friend, one final visit from me.  *clunk!*   uh oh.  that was not a sound my jeep should have made.  i slammed on the brakes, but nothing happened. the engine roared faster and faster. i was directly on a collision course with the terminus obelisk! that stupid little stick in the mud that could destroy the universe. sweating, i knew i had to make a split second decision... but i knew nathaniel would never forgive me if i didn't do it.  at the last minute, i swerved into my dearest friend, killing him instantly, and yelled,  *better nate than lever!*	1

an honest man a cowboy, who just moved to montana from texas, walks into a bar and orders three mugs of bud.   he sits in the back of the room, drinking a sip out of each one in turn.   when he finishes them, he comes back to the bar and orders three more.  the bartender approaches and tells the cowboy,  "you know, a mug goes flat after i draw it.   it would taste better if you bought one at a time."  the cowboy replies, "well, you see, i have two brothers. one is in arizona , the other is in colorado.   when we all left our home in texas, we promised that we'd drink this way to remember the days when we drank together.   so i'm drinking one beer for each of my brothers and one for myself."  the bartender admits that this is a nice custom, and leaves it there.  the cowboy becomes a regular in the bar, and always drinks the same way.  he orders three mugs and drinks them in turn.  one day, he comes in and only orders two mugs.  all the regulars take notice and fall silent.   when he comes back to the bar for the second round, the bartender says, "i don't want to intrude on your grief, but i wanted to offer my  condolences on your loss."  the cowboy looks quite puzzled for a moment, then a light dawns in his eyes and he laughs.  "oh, no, everybody's just fine," he explains.  "it's just that my wife and i joined the baptist church and i had to quit drinking."  “it hasn't affected my brothers though."	1

a programmer and an engineer  a programmer and an engineer are sitting next to each other on a very long flight from la to ny. the programmer leans over to the engineer and asks if he would like to play a fun game. the engineer just wants to take a nap, so he politely declines and rolls over to the window to catch a few winks. the programmer persists and explains that the game is really easy, and a lot of fun! he explains "i ask you a question, and if you don't know the answer, you pay me $5." again ,the engineer politely declines and tries to get some sleep.  the programmer, now somewhat agitated, says, "ok, if you don't know the answer you pay me $5, and if i don't know the answer, i will pay you $50!!!!!" this catches the engineer's complete attention, and he sees no end to this torment unless he plays, so he agrees to the game.  the programmer asks the first question. "what is the distance from the earth to the moon?" the engineer doesn't say a word, reaches in to his wallet, pulls out a $5 and hands it to the programmer.  now, it is the engineer's turn. he asks the programmer: "what goes up a hill with three legs, and comes down with four?"  the programmer looks at him with a puzzled look. he takes out his laptop computer and searches all his references. he taps into the airphone with his modem and searches the net and the library of congress. frustrated, he sends e-mail to all his co-workers and friends he knows. all to no avail. after an hour, he wakes the engineer and hands him $50.  the engineer politely takes the $50, and turns away to go back to sleep. the programmer, more than a little miffed, shakes the engineer and asks, "well, so what is the answer?"  without a word, the engineer reaches into his wallet, hands the programmer $5 and goes back to sleep	1

texas chili cook-off  notes from an inexperienced chili tester named frank, who was visiting texas from the east coast: *"recently, i was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. the original person called in sick at the last moment and i happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon, when the call came. i was assured by the other two judges (native texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy,*  *and besides, they told me i could have free beer during the tasting - so i accepted."*  here are the scorecards from the event:  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  chili # 1 - mike's maniac mobster monster chili  judge one: a little too heavy on tomato. amusing kick.  judge two: nice, smooth tomato flavor. very mild.  frank: holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? you could remove dried paint from your driveway. took me two beers to put the flames out. i hope that's the worst one. these texans are crazy.  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  chili # 2 - arthur's afterburner chili  judge one: smoky, with a hint of pork. slight jalapeno tang.  judge two: exciting bbq flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.  frank: keep this out of the reach of children. i'm not sure what i am supposed to taste besides pain. i had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the heimlich maneuver. they had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  chili # 3 - fred's famous burn down the barn chili  judge one: excellent firehouse chili! great kick. needs more beans.  judge two: a beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.  frank: call the epa, i've located a uranium spill. my nose feels like i have been snorting drano. everyone knows the routine by now get me more beer before i ignite. barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. i'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  chili # 4 - bubba's black magic  judge one: black bean chili with almost no spice. disappointing.  judge two: hint of lime in the black beans. good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.  frank: i felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. is it possible to burnout taste buds? sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look hot just like this nuclear waste i'm eating. is chili an aphrodisiac?  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  chili # 5 - linda's legal lip remover  judge one: meaty, strong chili. cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. very impressive!  judge two: chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.  frank: my ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and i can no longer focus my eyes. i farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. the contestant seemed offended when i told her that her chili had given me brain damage; sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. i wonder if i'm burning my lips off? it really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. screw those rednecks!  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  chili # 6 - vera's very vegetarian variety  judge one: thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. good balance of spice and peppers.  judge two: the best yet. aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. superb!  frank: my intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. i shit on myself when i farted and i'm worried it will eat through the chair. no one seems inclined to stand behind me except that sally. she must be kinkier than i thought. can't feel my lips anymore. i need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  chili # 7 - susan's screaming sensation chili  judge one: a mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.  judge two: ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. i should take note that i am worried about judge number 3, he appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.  frank: you could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and i wouldn't feel a damn thing. i've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. my shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. my pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. at least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. i've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. screw it, i'm not getting any oxygen anyway. if i need air, i'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.  \\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  chili # 8 - helen's mount saint chili  judge one: a perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare it's existence.  judge two: this final entry is a good, balanced chili. neither mild nor hot. sorry to see that most of it was lost when judge number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. not sure if he's going to make it. poor yank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili?  frank: (not available for comment.)	1

crap a young man went to a house to pick up his blind date. the girl wasn't quite ready, so her father  invited the lad to sit on the couch and wait. dad sat in his easy chair and proceeded to read his newspaper, while the family dog, rover, jumped onto the couch and sniffed out the stranger.     suddenly, the young man felt the urge to fart and didn't know what to do, however, since the dog was nearby, he decided to squeak it out and feign innocence.     "brrroough," went the fart! dad peered over his newspaper and said, "rover! get off that couch!"     the young man was relieved. obviously, dad thought rover had done the deed. soon, another fart rumbled in the young man's guts, and he let it rip, assured that rover would once again be blamed.     sure enough, dad peered over his newspaper and said more sharply, "rover! i said get off the couch!"     happily, the young man decided that he could fart whenever the urge arose and he let yet another one fly.     finally, dad threw down his newspaper in disgust and bellowed, "rover! for god's sake, get off that couch before he craps on you!!!"	1

the mafia was looking for a new man to make weekly collections from all the private businesses that they were "protecting."  feeling the heat from the police force, they decide to use a deaf and dumb person for this job. if he were to get caught, he wouldn't be able to communicate to the police what he was doing.  in his first week, the collector picks up over $40,000. he gets greedy, decides to keep the money, and stashes it in a safe place. the mafia soon realizes that their collection is late, and sends some of their hoods after the deaf and dumb collector.  the hoods find the collector and ask him where the money is. the deaf and dumb collector can't communicate with them, so the mafia drags the guy to an interpreter.  the mafia hood says to the interpreter, "ask him where da money is."  the interpreter signs, "where's the money?"  the dumb man signs back, "i don't know what you're talking about."  the interpreter tells the hood, "he says he doesn't know what you're talking about."  the hood pulls out a .38 and places it in the ear of the dumb collector. "now ask him where the money is!"  the interpreter signs, "where is the money?  the deaf man signs back, "the $40,000 is in a tree stump in central park."  the interpreter says to the hood, "he says he still doesn't know what you're talking about and doesn't think you have the balls to pull the trigger."	1

a gorilla walks into a bar...   a gorilla goes into a bar and orders a martini. this totally amazes the bartender, but he thinks, "what the heck, i guess i might as well make the drink." so he mixes the martini.  he then walks back over to the give it to the gorilla, and the animal is holding out a twenty-dollar bill. well, now the bartender is just at a loss for words. he can't believe that a gorilla walked into his bar, ordered a martini, and then actually had a twenty-dollar bill to pay for it.   so, in amazement, he takes the twenty and walks to the cash register to make the change. while he's standing in front of the cash register he stops for a second and thinks to himself, "let me try something here and see if the gorilla notices anything."   so he walks back over to the gorilla and hands him a dollar change. the gorilla doesn't say anything, he just sits there sipping the martini. after a few minutes the bartender just can't take it anymore. -  "you know," he says to the gorilla, "we don't get too many gorillas in here."   and the gorilla says, "at nineteen dollars a drink i'm not surprised."	1

ole and lena were married for 40 years when they first got married ole said, "i am putting a box under da bed. you must promise never ta look in it." in all their 40 years of marriage lena never looked. however, on the afternoon of their 40th anniversary curiosity got the best of her and she lifted the lid and peeked inside. in the box were 3 empty beer cans and $1934.87 in cash. she closed the box and put it back under the bed. now that she knew what was in the box, she was doubly curious as to why. that evening they were out for a special dinner. after dinner lena could no longer contain her curiosity and she confessed, saying, "i am so sorry ole. for all dese years i kept my promise and never looked inta da box under our bed. however today da temptation vas too much and i gave in. but now i need ta know vy do you keep da cans in da box?" ole thought for a while and said, "i guess after all dese years you deserve ta know da truth. whenever i vas unfaithful ta you i put an empty beer can in da box under da bed to remind myself not to do it again." lena was shocked, but said, "i am very disappointed and saddened but i guess after all dose years away from home on the road, temptation does happen and i guess dat 3 times is not dat bad considering da years." they hugged and made their peace. a little while later lena asked, "ole, vy do you have all dat money in da box?" ole answered, "oh, whenever da box filled with empties, i cashed em in."	1

seven lessons of life **lesson 1:**  a man is getting into the shower just as his wife is finishing up her shower when the doorbell rings. the wife quickly wraps herself in a towel and runs downstairs. when she opens the door, there stands bob, the next door neighbour. before she says a word, bob says, “i’ll give you $800 to drop that towel.” after thinking for a moment, the woman drops her towel and stands naked in front of bob.  after a few seconds, bob hands her $800 dollars and leaves. the woman wraps back up in the towel and goes back upstairs. when she gets to the bathroom, her husband asks,…  “who was that?” “it was bob the next door neighbour,” she replies. “great!” the husband says, “did he say anything about the $800 he owes me?”  *moral of the story:*  if you share critical information pertaining to credit and risk with your shareholders in time, you may be in a position to prevent avoidable exposure.  **lesson 2:**  a sales rep, an administration clerk, and the manager are walking to lunch when they find an antique oil lamp. they rub it and a genie comes out. the genie says, “i’ll give each of you just one wish” “me first! me first!” says the administration clerk. “i want to be in the bahamas, driving a speedboat, without a care in the world.” poof! she’s gone. “me next! me next!” says the sales rep. “i want to be in hawaii, relaxing on the beach with my personal masseuse, an endless supply of pina coladas and the love of my life.” poof! he’s gone. “ok, you’re up,” the genie says to the manager. the manager says, “i want those two back in the office after lunch.”  *moral of the story:*  always let your boss have the first say  **lesson 3:**  a priest offered a lift to a nun. she got in and crossed her legs, forcing her gown to reveal a leg. the priest nearly had an accident. after controlling the car, he stealthily slid his hand up her leg. the nun said,”father, remember psalm 129?” the priest removed his hand. but, changing gears, he let his hand slide up her leg again. the nun once again said, “father, remember psalm 129?” the priest apologized “sorry sister but the flesh is weak.” arriving at the convent, the nun went on her way. on his arrival at the church, the priest rushed to look up psalm 129. it said, “go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory.”  *moral of the story:*  if you are not well informed in your job, you might miss a great opportunity  **lesson 4:**  a crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day. a rabbit asked him, ”can i also sit like you and do nothing all day long?” the crow answered: “sure, why not.” so, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.  a fox jumped on the rabbit and ate it.  *moral of the story:*  to be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very high up  **lesson 5:**  power of charisma  a turkey was chatting with a bull “i would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,” sighed the turkey, but i haven’t got the energy.” “well, why don’t you nibble on my droppings?” replied the bull. “they’re packed with nutrients.” the turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it gave him enough strength to reach the lowest branch of the tree. the next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch. finally after a fourth night, there he was proudly perched at the top of the tree. soon he was spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the tree.  *moral of the story:*  bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there  **lesson 6:**  a little bird was flying south for the winter. it was so cold the bird froze and fell to the ground into a large field. while he was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on him. as the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung, he began to realize how warm he was. the dung was actually thawing him out! he lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy. a passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate. following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung, and promptly dug him out and ate him.  *moral of the story:*  1. not everyone who shits on you is your enemy 2. not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend 3. and when you’re in deep shit, it’s best to keep your mouth shut!  **lesson 7:**  the psalm 129 and it doesn't contain the words "go forth and seek, further up, you will find glory."  *moral of the story:*  don't believe everything posted on reddit, dummy	1
an atheist in hell an athiest in hell    an atheist dies and goes to hell  the devil welcomes him and says:"let me show you around a little bit." they walk through a nice park with green trees and the devil shows him a huge palace. "this is your house now, here are your keys." the man is happy and thanks the devil. the devil says:"no need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in when they come down here!"  they continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars. "these are your cars now!" and hands the man all the car keys. again, the atheist tries to thank the devil, but he only says "everyone down here gets some cool cars! how would you drive around without having cars?".  they walk on and the area gets even nicer. there are birds chirping, squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. they arrive at a fountain, where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a bench. she looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other. the man couldn´t be any happier. the devil says "everyone gets to have their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!"  as they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. he peeks to the other side and is totally shocked. there are people in pools of lava, screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with their tridents. other devils are skinning people alive, heads are spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. a stench of sulfur is in the air.  terrified, the man stumbles backwards, and asks the devil "what is going on there?" the devil just shrugs and says: "those are the christians, i don´t know why, but they prefer it that way".	1

dear tech support, last year i upgraded from girlfriend 7.0 to wife 1.0 and noticed that the new program began unexpected child processing that took up a lot of new space and valuable resources. no mention of this phenomenon was included in the product brochure.  in addition, wife 1.0 installs itself into all other programs and launches during system initialization, where it monitors all other system activity. applications such as poker night 10.3, drunken boys night 2.5 and saturday football 5.0 no longer run, crashing the system whenever selected.  i cannot seem to keep wife 1.0 in the background while attempting to run some of my other favorite applications. i am thinking about going back to girlfriend 7.0, but the uninstall does not work on this program.  can you please help me !!!???  thanks, a troubled user  ------------------------------------------------------------  dear troubled user,  this is a very common complaint, but is mostly due to a primary misconception. many people upgrade from girlfriend 7.0 to wife 1.0 with the idea that wife 1.0 is merely a utilities & entertainment program. wife 1.0 is an operating system and designed by it's creator to run everything.  it is unlikely you would be able to purge wife 1.0 and still convert back to girlfriend 7.0. hidden operating files within your system would cause girlfriend 7.0 to emulate wife 1.0 so nothing is gained. it is impossible to uninstall, delete, or purge the program files from the system once installed. you cannot go back to girlfriend 7.0 because wife 1.0 is not designed to do this.  some have tried to install girlfriend 8.0 or wife 2.0 but end up with more problems than the original system. look in your manual under "warnings- alimony/child support". i recommend you keep wife 1.0 and deal with the situation.  i suggest installing background application program c:yes dear to alleviate software augmentation. having installed wife 1.0 myself, i might also suggest you read the entire section regarding general partnership faults (gpfs). you must assume all responsibility for faults and problems that might occur, regardless of their cause. the best course of action will be to enter the command c:apologize. in any case avoid excessive use of c:yes dear because ultimately you may have to give the apologize command before the operating system will return to normal. the system will run smoothly as long as you take the blame for all the gpfs.  wife 1.0 is a great program, but very high-maintenance. consider buying additional software to improve the performance of wife 1.0. i recommend flowers 3.1 and diamonds 2k. do not, under any circumstances install secretary with short skirt 3.3. this is not a supported application for wife 1.0 and is likely to cause irreversible damage to the operating system.  best of luck, tech support	1
a man walks down the streets of new york dragging a dead horse. a passer by sees the scene and intrigued goes and asks "what are you doing dragging a dead horse in the middle of the city streets?"  man says "help me cross it the street and i'll tell you."  passer by helps him out "now will you tell me?"  man says "help me get it up to the 5th floor of this building and i'll tell you."  so the guy helps him. they get to the 5th floor, "how about now? dying to know"  "help me get it into apartment 55 and i'll tell you"  they proceed in carrying the dead carcass into the apartment. "come on man tell me, i've helped you!"  "one final thing, help me carry it into the bathtub and after that i promice i'll tell you everything"  they carry it into the bathtub. both exhausted collapse on the couch.  the man goes:  "ok my new found friend, here it is. couple nights ago i was sitting relaxed watching the game, having a beer when the door bell rings. i go and open the door, lo and behold, it's the devil. he says to me that he wants to come in and play a game of chess".  "and?!?!"  "and we started playing. i move my rook he says "i knew you would move the rook". i don't say anything, he's the devil so i continue playing. i take his queen, he says "i knew you would take my queen. i checkmate him he goes "i knew you would checkmate me." that's where i snapped and punched him in the face. he gets up from his chair, goes to the bathroom, washes his face, bids me good night and leaves."  "wow man, crazy story but what's the horse got to do with it?"  "just wait man i'm not finished. last night, same story. knock on the door, i open it, it's the devil. wants to play chess again. identical game. i move my rook he says "i knew you would move the rook". i don't say anything, he's the devil so i continue playing. i take his queen, he says "i knew you would take my queen. i checkmate him he goes "i knew you would checkmate me." that's where i snapped and punched him in the face. he gets up from his chair, goes to the bathroom, washes his face, bids me good night and leaves."  "ok man i get you, never heard a story like this, but what does the horse have to do with it?!"  "listen up friend. here's what it has to do with it. i betcha the a-hole will come knocking on my door tonight too, and i betcha he'll want to play chess again. and i'll betcha he'll do his same old routine again, and of course i'll snap and punch the living bejezus out of him, and he'll go again to the bathroom to wash his face, but when he comes out he'll say "you have a dead horse in your bathtub", and i'll say "i knew you'd say i had a dead horse in my bathtub you twit!!!"  &#x200b;  edit: typos	1

"sir, i know it's bad form to look, but i noticed your tattoo. i have the same one. what are the odds two guys with 'wendy' tattoos would be standing next to each other?"  the rastafarian gives bill a funny look, then glances down.

several churches started having problems with squirrels damaging their buildings. the presbyterian church called a meeting to decide what to do about their squirrel infestation.  after much prayer and consideration, they concluded that the squirrels were predestined to be there, and they should not interfere with god’s divine will.  at the baptist church, the squirrels had taken an interest in the baptistry.  the deacons met and decided to put a water-slide on the baptistry and let the squirrels drown themselves.  the squirrels liked the slide and, unfortunately, knew instinctively how to swim, so twice as many squirrels showed up the following week.  the lutheran church decided that they were not in a position to harm any of god’s creatures.  so, they humanely trapped their squirrels and set them free near the baptist church.  two weeks later, the squirrels were back when the baptists took down the water-slide.  the episcopalians tried a much more unique path by setting out pans of whiskey around their church in an effort to kill the squirrels with alcohol poisoning.  they sadly learned how much damage a band of drunk squirrels can do.  but the catholic church came up with a more creative strategy!  they baptized all the squirrels and made them members of the church.  now they only see them at christmas and easter.  not much was heard from the jewish synagogue.  they took the first squirrel and circumcised him.  they haven’t seen a squirrel since.	1

no sex tonight! i've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.  and i never have figured out the whole venus and mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.  for example… one evening last week, my wife and i were getting into bed.  well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said "i don't feel like it, i just want you to hold me."  i said "what??!! what was that?!"  so she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear..."you're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man."  she responded to my puzzled look by saying, "can't you just love me for who i am and not what i do for you in the bedroom?"  realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, i went to sleep.  the very next day, i opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. we went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. i walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. she couldn't decide which one to take so i told her we'd just buy them all. she wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so i said lets get a pair for each outfit. we went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.  let me tell you...she was so excited. she must have thought i was one wave short of a tsunami. i started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. but, i think i threw her for a loop when i said, "that's fine, honey."  she appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, "i think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier."  i could hardly contain myself when i blurted out, "no honey, i don't feel like it."  her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, "what?"  i then said "honey, i just want you to hold this stuff for a while.  you're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman."  and just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, i added, "why can't you just love me for who i am and not for the things i buy you?"  apparently, no sex tonight either!	1

golf hooker  a man became an avid golfer. so much so that he'd never gotten to know a female well enough to even think about marriage.  as the years went by, he realized he'd probably never get married, since he sure wasn't giving up golf.    as it so happens, he finally did meet a wonderful woman, and in short order they grew very fond of each other. he kept asking himself: “is this the one?”   one evening at a restaurant, he opened up to her. “as you have probably figured out, i've grown very fond of you, and have started to think about a future together”   she interrupted to say “i have been feeling the same was about us.”      he smiled at her and continued:  "i have a confession to make that i should have made before, but i was concerned that it might affect our relationship.”   "what is it?"     "i'm a golf fanatic," he said. "i think about golf constantly. i'll be out on the golf course just about every day, every holiday, just every chance i get. i try to play 36 holes each day, but if the weather is good, i'll try to pay even more.”   he finished with: “i thought you should know before we go any further.”   she pondered this for a moment and said, "i thank you for your honesty. now in the same spirit of honesty, i should tell you that i've concealed something about my own past that you should know about. the truth is, "i'm a hooker."   there is a long pause, and her heart was sinking with every second of protracted silence.    she watched him fidget with his hands, and still there is silence.  she began to despair.  finally, he picks his head and looks right at her: "that's not really a problem.  just widen your stance a little, and overlap your grip, and that should clear it right up."	1

an atheist is hiking in the woods... so an atheist is hiking in the woods when he stumbles across a huge hungry grizzly bear. the bear rears up to full height and gives a roar as it leans in toward the man. the atheist screams in terror "oh god, help me!!!"  suddenly, everything--> the bear, the trees, the birds, everything but the man--freezes. the man sees the clouds part as a deep heavenly voice reaches his ears. "so all your life, you deny my existence, yet now you call for my aid now that death is upon you? i am sorry, my son, but it is too late."  the atheist thinks quickly. "well, god, if it is too late for me to become a christian, how about you just convert the bear?"  time begins moving again, and the bear immediately stops its roaring, kneels quietly and respectfully, and begins speaking. "o lord, bless this meal in which i am about to partake..."  &nbsp;  edit: thanks for the awards. please contribute to /r/doctorswithoutborders  [link](https://donate.doctorswithoutborders.org/onetime.cfm) i will do same.	1

"it's in the parking lot."  the loan officer approved her for the loan and offered the bank shuttle to take her to the airport. "don't worry about your car, we'll put it in our employee parking garage."   two weeks later, the same woman walked into the bank, and paid off the loan in full, plus $20 interest. the loan officer had her car brought up from the garage, and gave her the title and keys.  "ma'am, i'm interested in why you took this loan. i looked at your accounts, you certainly didn't need the cash flow. all you did was pay us $20 for the pleasure of holding your car for two weeks."  the woman smiled. "where else can i get secure covered parking for two weeks and a shuttle service for $20?"	1

the lions birthday is coming up and he wants entertainment. the lion’s birthday is coming up and he wants entertainment.  so he tells the zebra to find the funniest animal in the whole kingdom. in order to do this the zebra decides to hold a competition in which animals will have to compete in front of a judge. whoever the first one to makemake the judge laugh wins and will perform for the lion.  so the first thing the zebra does is look for the most serious animal. he walks up to a tortoise and asks, “hey tortoise, i’m holding a competition and all you have to do is sit there and laugh if you find an animal to be funny. will you do it?”  the tortoise responds, “...yes.”  the day of the competition arrives and all the animals have gathered to compete. since this is for the lion, the zebra decides to raise the stakes to ensure every animal delivers their full potential. he says, “animals, your goal is to make the tortoise laugh. if you are able to do so, you win and get to perform for the lion. if you fail to make the tortoise laugh, then you will be killed and become the lion’s meal.”  the competition begins and up first is the monkey. he jumps from tree to tree, does flips, and makes funny noises. the zebra becomes pleased and looks at the tortoise and asks what he thinks, to which the tortoise says, “...” since there is no reaction from the judge, the monkey is killed.  up next is the ostrich. he runs around in circles and is moving his long neck. he jumps and does funny moves. the zebra is once again pleased and turns to see the reaction of the tortoise, which once again is, “...” so there’s nothing the zebra can do and they have the ostrich killed.  this pattern goes on with many of the funniest animals and the zebra becomes worried that they won’t have someone for the lion’s party. all of a sudden the next animal approaches, the hippopotamus. the zebra knows that he won’t be able to perform any fun tricks and just as he’s about to have him killed, he hears a chuckle from the tortoise. that chuckle turns into full blown roars of laughter. the zebra is bewildered and asks the tortoise, “hey what’s so funny? he hasn’t done anything! he is literally just standing there!”   the tortoise responds, “haha, wow that monkey was hilarious!”	1

are my testicles black? a male patient is lying in bed in the hospital, wearing an oxygen   mask over his mouth and nose. a young student nurse appears and   gives him a partial sponge bath.   "nurse,"' he mumbles from behind the mask, "are my testicles black?"   embarrassed, the young nurse replies, "i don't know, sir. i'm only   here to wash your upper body and feet."   he struggles to ask again, "nurse, please check for me. are my   testicles black?"   concerned that he might elevate his blood pressure and heart rate   from worrying about his testicles, she overcomes her embarrassment   and pulls back the covers.   she raises his gown, holds his manhood in one hand and his testicles   gently in the other.   she looks very closely and says, "there's nothing wrong with them,   sir. they look fine."   the man slowly pulls off his oxygen mask, smiles at her, and says   very slowly, "thank you very much. that was wonderful. now listen   very, very closely:   are - my - test - results - back?"	1

seven dwarfs and the midget nun the seven dwarfs were in a catholic church. they were sitting near the rear and as the priest was speaking, they whispered and giggled amongst themselves, causing quite a disturbance. all of a sudden, dopey stands up and says, "father, are there any midget nuns in the church ?" "no," said the priest, "there are no midget nuns in the church." a little time passed and the dwarfs were again whispering and giggling amongst themselves causing quite a disturbance and noticeably angering the priest. soon, dopey stands up again and asks, "father, are there any midget nuns in the city?" "no, my son, there are no midget nuns in the city or in the church." says the priest. again the dwarfs resume their annoying giggling to the dismay of the priest. once again, dopey stands up and asks "father, are there any midget nuns in the state?" "no, my son, there are no midget nuns in the state, in the city, and no midget nuns in the church." exclaimed the priest, obviously upset. the dwarfs continue their interference. dopey stands up and asks, "father, are there any midget nuns in the country?" the priest, totally angered, exclaims "no, my son, there are no midget nuns in the church, in the city, in the state, no midget nuns in the country, there are no midget nuns in the whole world!!! now sit down!!!!!" soon afterwards, a chant can be heard from the rear of the church, "dopey fucked a penguin. dopey fucked a penguin. dopey fucked a penguin."	1

grandma is eighty-eight years old and still drives her own car. she writes: dear grand-daughter,   the other day i went up to our local christian book store and saw a "honk" if you love jesus' bumper sticker. i was feeling particularly sassy that day because i had just come from a thrilling choir performance, followed by a thunderous prayer meeting. so, i bought the sticker and put it on my bumper.  boy, am i glad i did; what an uplifting experience that followed.  i was stopped at a red light at a busy intersection, just lost in thought about the lord and how good he is, and i didn't notice that the light had changed.   it is a good thing someone else loves jesus because if he hadn't honked, i'd never have noticed. i found that lots of people love jesus! while i was sitting there, the guy behind started honking like crazy, and then he leaned out of his window and screamed, 'for the love of god!' 'go! go! go! jesus christ, go!'   what an exuberant cheerleader he was for jesus! everyone started honking! i just leaned out my window and started waving and smiling at all those loving people. i even honked my horn a few times to share in the love! ; there must have been a man from florida back there because i heard him yelling something about a sunny beach.   i saw another guy waving in a funny way with only his middle finger stuck up in the air. i asked my young teenage grandson in the back seat what that meant. he said it was probably a hawaiian good luck sign or something. well, i have never met anyone from hawaii , so i leaned out the window and gave him the good luck sign right back.   my grandson burst out laughing. why even he was enjoying this religious experience!! a couple of the people were so caught up in the joy of the moment that they got out of their cars and started walking towards me. i bet they wanted to pray or ask what church i attended, but this is when i noticed the light had changed. so, grinning, i waved at all my brothers and sisters, and drove on through the intersection.   i noticed that i was the only car that got through the intersection before the light changed again and felt kind of sad that i had to leave them after all the love we had shared. so, i slowed the car down, leaned out the window and gave them all the hawaiian good luck sign one last time as i drove away. praise the lord for such wonderful folks!!   will write again soon,   love, grandma	1

"good morning. pastor," he replied, still focused on the plaque. "pastor, what is this?"  the pastor replied, "well, son, it's a memorial to all the young men and women who died in the service." soberly, they just stood together, staring at the large plaque.  finally, little ronny's voice, barely audible and trembling with fear asked,"which service, the 8:00 or the 10:30?"	1

"i was due for an appointment with the gynecologist later in the week. early one morning, i received a call from the doctor's office to tell me that i had been rescheduled for that morning at 9:30 am. i had only just packed everyone off to work and school, and it was already around 8:45 am. the trip to his office took about 35 minutes, so i didn't have any time to spare.  as most women do, i like to take a little extra effort over hygiene when making such visits, but this time i wasn't going to be able to make the full effort. so, i rushed upstairs, threw off my pajamas, wet the washcloth that was sitting next to the sink, and gave myself a quick wash in that area to make sure i was at least presentable. i threw the washcloth in the clothes basket, donned some clothes, hopped in the car and raced to my appointment. i was in the waiting room for only a few minutes when i was called in. knowing the procedure, as i'm sure you do, i hopped up on the table, looked over at the other side of the room and pretended that i was in paris or some other place a million miles away. i was a little surprised when the doctor said, "my, we have made an extra effort this morning, haven't we?" i didn't respond. after the appointment, i heaved a sigh of relief and went home. the rest of the day was normal. some shopping, cleaning, cooking. after school when my 6 year old daughter was playing, she called out from the bathroom, "mommy, where's my washcloth?" i told her to get another one from the cupboard. she replied  “no, i need the one that was here by the sink, it had all my glitter and sparkles saved inside it."	1

as a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: "5 lamb chops, please." as a butcher is shooing a dog from his shop,he sees a $10 and a note in his mouth, reading: "5 lamb chops, please." amazed, he takes the money, puts a bag of chops in the dog's mouth,and quickly closes the shop. he follows the dog and watches him wait for a green light, look both ways, and trot across the road to a bus-stop. the dog checks the timetable and sits on the bench. when a bus arrives, he walks around to the front and looks at the number, then boards the bus. the butcher follows, dumbstruck. as the bus travels out into the suburbs, the dog takes in the scenery. after awhile he stands on his back paws to push the "stop" bell, then the butcher follows him off. the dog runs up to a house and drops his bag on the step. he goes back down the path, takes a big run, and throws himself -whap!- against the door. he does this again and again. no answer. so he jumps on a wall, walks around the garden, beats his head against a window, jumps off, and waits at the front door. a big guy opens it and starts cursing and shouting at the dog. the butcher runs up and screams at the guy: "what the hell are you doing? this dog's a genius!" the owner responds, "genius, my ass......... it's the second time this week he's forgotten his keys!"	1

an american soldier, serving in world war ii, had just returned from several weeks of intense action on the german front lines. he had finally been granted r&r and was on a train bound for london. the train was very crowded, so the soldier walked the length of the train, looking for an empty seat. the only unoccupied seat was directly adjacent to a well dressed middle aged lady and was being used by her little dog.  the war weary soldier asked, "please, ma'am, may i sit in that seat?" the english woman looked down her nose at the soldier, sniffed and said, "you americans. you are such a rude class of people. can't you see my little fifi is using that seat?" the soldier walked away, determined to find a place to rest, but after another trip down to the end of the train, found himself again facing the woman with the dog.  again he asked, "please, lady. may i sit there? i'm very tired." the english woman wrinkled her nose and snorted, "you americans! not only are you rude, you are also arrogant."  the soldier didn"t say anything else; he leaned over, picked up the little dog, tossed it out the window of the train and sat down in the empty seat.  the woman shrieked and railed, and demanded that someone defend her and chastise the soldier.  an english gentleman sitting across the aisle spoke up, "you know, sir, you americans do seem to have a penchant for doing the wrong thing. you eat holding the fork in the wrong hand. you drive your automobiles on the wrong side of the road. and now, sir, you've thrown the wrong bitch out the window."	1

"when white man found this land, indians were running it."   "no taxes."   "no debt."     "plenty buffalo."   "plenty beaver."     "women did all the work."   "medicine man free."     "indian man spent all day hunting and fishing."   "all night having sex."     then chief leaned back and smiled, "only white man dumb enough to think   he could improve system like that."	1

a man walks into a bar with the head a size of an orange the man is dressed in an  expensive suit, has a beautiful supermodel hanging off each arm, and has  a limo parked outside. but the man has head the size of an orange.  the  customer sits down at the bar and orders everyone a drink. he pays for it from a roll of hundreds and manages to get the attention of every  woman in the joint, despite having an orange-sized head.  the bartender is not a man to pry, but he feels compelled to ask about this man's life.  "excuse  me," says the bartender, "i can't help but notice that you're obviously fabulously wealthy and irresistible to women, but you have an orange-sized head. how are you so successful?"  so the man told his story.  "a  while back, when i was penniless, i was walking along the beach and saw  an old lamp, half buried in the sand. i picked it up and gave it a  clean, and poof! out popped a beautiful genie. the genie explained that she had been trapped in that lamp for two hundred years, and that he was so  grateful to me for freeing him that she would give me any three wishes.  "for my first wish i asked for an unlimited fortune. the genie said 'it is done!' and from then on, whenever i needed money, it was there.  "for  my second wish i asked for the attention of all the most beautiful  women in the world. the genie said it was done, and since then i have  been able to get any woman i wanted.  "for my third wish -- and, i think this is where i fucked up -- i asked for a head the size of an orange."	1
another one translated to english, this time from czech :) a farmer went to the mall to do some shopping. he bought an anvil and a bucket in the hardware store.   in the animal store he bought a pair of chickens and a goose. but how to carry it all now?   the shopkeeper advised him: "put the anvil in the bucket and carry that in one hand, put the goose in your other hand and carry each chicken under one of your arms." the farmer did that, thanked him and exited the store.   on his way home, a beautiful, well-endowed girl stopped him, said she got lost and that she needs to get to a certain address.   "what a coincidence! i'm going to visit my brother, who lives not far from there. come with me and i'll take you there. we can cross the park this way so it's a shorter walk."   "the park? but how can i trust you that you're not going to push me against the fence, roll up my skirt, take off my panties and ...?"   "look at me. i'm carrying a bucket, an anvil, a goose and two chickens. like this, how could i push you against the fence and do what you're afraid of?"   "well, with a bit of creativity you could put the goose on the ground, cover it with the bucket, weight it down with the anvil - and i can hold on to the chickens."	1

a man buys a motorbike and is riding it home when it occurs to him that he's somewhat lacking control, as the wind is getting into his coat and buffeting him quite badly. he pulls over, deciding to put his coat on back-to-front so the openings between the buttons are at the back.   much improved he confidently accelerates away, but within five minutes of riding like this he reaches a sharp bend in the road, where he discovers his arms are rather too restricted in their movement owing to his coat being on backwards and he duly crashes.  many people rush over to his aid. "are you ok?" asks one, a \\[insert member of despised group notorious for having a low-intellect- an 'unfair, ill-deserved and completely unfounded reputation' of your choice here\\].

"there's more, after i tied her left leg up, she started kicking the bucket the right leg, so i had to tie that to a post as well. "understandable" says the bartender. "yes, that's all good, but next my cow kept hitting my face with it's tail. it was annoying so went to get some rope to hold the tail up, but i was out of rope, so i used the next available thing - my belt. so i held the tail up with my belt, and just then my wife walked in and my pants fell down and."

an american spy goes to russia in soviet russia, an american spy tries to blend in...  george keats had trained 20 years for this moment. he had mastered the russian language in its native accent. he learned all of russia's customs and social graces. he memorized moscow streetmaps and knew every back-alley there was. he swore that he could even think like a russian.  the big day finally came, and he was parachuted to the outskirts of moscow at night. he emerged by daybreak, and hopped onto a bus going to the city center.  "comrade. how much for a ticket to red square?", he asked the conductor in authentic russian.  "5 rubles, comrade american", came the reply.  keats was stunned. perhaps the conductor was just being a smart-ass. he hopped off the bus and asked a passerby for directions to the closest bar.  "it's just around the block, comrade american."  keats' doubts grew immensely. not knowing what to do, he went inside the bar and ordered a glass of vodka.  "want some borscht to go with it, comrade american?", the bartender asked.  keats threw a fit. "what's the matter with you people? i dress just like you, i speak just like you, i even think just like you! why does everyone keep calling me american?"  "well comrade, it's because you're black."﻿	1

little red riding hood strolls into a dark forest, delivering her goodies as usual. “la la la la la, la la la la la,” she caroled.  all of the sudden she encounters a vicious wolf that appears to be behind a tree. she becomes fearful for her life, but the wolf notices her presence and runs off into the darkness.  red, confused, shrugs and goes about her stroll.  “la la la la la, la la la la la”  once again she encounters the wolf, but this time behind a rock. instead of being fearful, now she’s skeptical. the wolf notices her presence again and runs off into the darkness.  confused again, but red shrugged it off once more and strolled again.  “la la la la la, la la la la la”  once more, she encounters the wolf, this time behind a bush. having enough, she plops down her basket and asks, “what’s the big deal, why do you keep following me?”  the wolf is taken aback, startled from her presence, “ugh! why can’t i take a shit in peace!?”	1

be careful what you ask for... there was a guy who was born deformed, he didn't have a body, he was just a head.  he had family and a loyal group of friends that would include him and they would usually just carry him under their arm from place to place.  one day he went with friends to a local bar where they sat him on top of the bar like usual.  the bartender, used to seeing him, brought him his drink with a bendable straw that he stocked just for him.  they were drinking, laughing, and enjoying themselves when a drunk patron approached the group.  "i don't like him.  he shouldn't be here!"  stammered the drunk.  "well, he's with us and it's none of your business."  replied one of his friends.  from there a not-so-civil discussion began with each comment ramping up the heat a bit.  finally, the drunk grabbed the head and rolled him out the door, across the sidewalk and into the street.  as you can imagine, a full on bar fight ensued with everyone inside participating and no one paying attention to their friend out in the street.  just then a genie appeared to the guy in the street and offered him one wish.   the guy responded, "all of my life i have had to rely on others for everything, even the simplest of things, because i don't have a body.  i want a body.  i want to walk.  i want to run.  i want to be like everybody else, i want a body!"   the genie complied and in an instant the man was standing looking down at his new body.  suddenly, everything went black and he felt immense pain as a beer truck plowed into him.  his friends hearing what would soon be a fatal accident rushed out to see what had happened.  they see a person laying still in the street and rush over to check on him.  they roll him faceup and to their amazement it is their friend.  with his last breath he looks at them and says, "i should have stopped while i was a head"	1

an elderly couple was having dinner at the diner where they had their first date. the husband said, "it's so nice to be back here after all these years."

"how could i forget?" answered the husband, "you took me behind that building there across the street and let me put you up against the fence where you gave me the best sex of my life!"  a policeman, who had been overhearing the conversation, nearly spit out his coffee.  "what do you say we do it again?" suggested the wife.  "oh, you naughty devil!" replied the elderly man. he quickly asked the waitress for the cheque and took his wife by the hand, leading her across the street.   the police officer decided to follow them. he thought it was so sweet that a couple of their age could still be so attracted to one another and spontaneous.  he didn't want to ruin their moment but also wanted to make sure nothing bad happened to them, so he decided to keep half an eye on them from a distance.  but the officer could not have prepared himself for what he was about to see. the elderly man dropped his khakis as his wife lifted her dress and propped herself up against the chain link fence. the twisting, the turning, the acrobatics! they elderly couple were as spry and agile as any young couple in their 20's.  when the pair of old lovers were finally finished, lying on the ground catching their breath, the officer couldn't resist. he walked over and said,   "beg your pardon. i couldn't help overhearing your conversation in the diner and wanted to make sure you were ok ... but please tell me your secret! i've never seen anyone make love with that much passion and enthusiasm, let alone a couple who has been married for as long as you have. please, after 50 years of marriage, what is your secret?"  "there's no secret," answered the husband, "but 50 years ago that fence wasn't electric."	1

a scotsman, an englishman and a frenchman are walking through the jungle... they’re very tired, and they decide to take a shortcut across a nearby river to quickly reach  their camp.   as they cross the river, a tribe of savages charge out of the trees and surround them. the tribe chief steps forward and says  “this river sacred ground... you trespass on sacred ground! now, as punishment, you die.”  the chief goes on to explain that after they kill them, the tribe will use their skin to make canoes. they will then sail these canoes on the river as a warning to future trespassers.   however, (as he is a kind leader) the chief decides that although the three men  must die, they may choose how they die and even do it themselves if they wish. the three men agree, and the englishman goes first  “i would like a gun, please”  the chief hands him a gun. the englishman thanks him, shouts “god save the queen!” and blows his own brains out. the tribe drag his corpse away to turn into a canoe. the frenchman goes next  “i would like some poison, si vous plait”  the chief hands him some poison. the frenchman thanks him, shouts “viva la france!” and drinks it. he instantly dies, and the tribe drag his corpse away to turn into a canoe. finally, it’s the scotsman’s turn   “i want a fork”  the chief is very confused, but nevertheless hands him a fork. the scotsman thanks the chief, before beginning to frantically stab himself all over his body. his arms, legs, face, chest, back, anywhere he can reach. after a good thirty seconds, he finally drops the fork, blood now gushing from the hundreds of tiny holes across his body.  “there goes yer canoe ya fat c*nt”	1

a young jackaroo from outback queensland goes off to university, but halfway through the semester he foolishly has squandered all of his money.  he calls home. 'dad,' he says, 'you won't believe what modern education is developing. they actually have a program here in brisbane that will teach our dog ol' blue how to talk.'   'that's amazing!' his dad says. 'how do i get ol' blue in that program?'   'just send him down here with $2,000,' the young jackaroo says, 'i'll get him in the course.'   so ... his father sends the dog and $2,000.   about two-thirds through the semester, the money again runs out. the boy calls home. 'so how's ol' blue doing, son?' his father wants to know.   'awesome! dad, he's talking up a storm. but you just won't believe this. they've had such good results with talking, they've begun to teach the animals how to read.'   'read?' exclaims his father. 'no kidding! how do we get ol' blue in that program?'

an old rish woman visited her physician to ask his advice on reviving her husband's libido. "what about trying viagra," asked the doctor. "not a chance," she said, "he won't even take an aspirin." "not a problem," replied the doctor. "give him an irish viagra." "what is irish viagra?" she asked. "it's when you drop the viagra tablet into his coffee. he won't even taste it. give it a try and let's talk in a week." a week later the doctor called the woman to check on the results. the poor dear exclaimed, "oh, faith, bejaysus and begorrah! t'was horrid! just terrible, doctor!" "oh my, really? what happened?" asked the doctor.  "well, i did as you advised and slipped it in his coffee and the effect was almost immediate. he jumped straight up, with a smile on his face, a twinkle in his eye and with his pants a-bulging fiercely! with one swoop of his arms, he sent me biscuits, gravy, cups and saucers flying, ripped me clothes to tatters and took me then and there passionately on the tabletop! t'was a nightmare, i tell you, an absolute nightmare!"  "why so terrible?" asked the doctor, "do you mean the sex your husband provided wasn't good?" freaking jaysus, it was the best sex i've had in 25 years! but sure as i'm sitting here, i'll never be able to show me face at that restaurant again.	1

"probably it's a celebration day and they are preparing something for the old monks", he thought.  at that moment he looks straight forward and finds a monk who looks to be in charge. he goes to that monk and asks "what are all these young monks doing here? is this this some kind of celebration?"  the monk laughs and tells him "no, this isn't any celebration at all. these monks are only doing everything they can to better their souls". the man got confused about it. "how can cooking help to better a soul?" he asked.  the monk with a big smile on his face replies "well, young generations found out that having cake is the best way to gain karma"	1
