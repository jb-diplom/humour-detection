Let's clean this shit up.\n\nA lot of you posting in here don't seem to understand what sarcasm is. Sarcasm can be entangled in a joke, but a joke is not sarcasm by default. Knock knock jokes are not sarcasm. Everything off of /r/jokes is not sarcasm.\n\nSarcasm can be complicated and it can be simple, but it is *NOT* just a joke. From this point on I'm cracking down on content that can't figure out what the hell sarcasm is. I don't care if this subreddit dies for a month because of this, it will have some fucking sarcasm in it.\n\nIf you are going to post jokes with no sarcasm in them, go to /r/jokes. We don't want it here, it has nothing to do with us. Just **STOP.**\n\nIf you know what sarcasm actually is, you can safely skip everything below this point.\n\n# Learn what Sarcasm is if you don't know...\n\nCredits to [YourDictionary](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-sarcasm.html) for virtually everything below this point... saved me a lot of time.\n\nSarcasm is an ironic or [satirical remark](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/satire-examples.html) tempered by humor. Mainly, people use it to say the opposite of what's true to make someone look or feel foolish.\n\nSarcasm can also be used for [comedic relief](https://examples.yourdictionary.com/examples-of-humor.html). For example, \"I walked into my hotel room and wondered if the interior  decorators thought orange was the new black\". The main gist of sarcasm is that the words are not meant to be taken literally. Let's walk through some examples of sarcasm for a better understanding.\n\n|Situation:|Sarcastic Remark:|\n|:-|:-|\n|When someone puts on too much perfume:|Nice perfume. How long did you marinate in it?|\n|When something bad happens:|That's just what I needed today!|\n|When a husband comes home after a long day at work:|I work 40 hours a week for us to be this poor.|\n|When you expected something to happen, especially after warning someone about it:|Well, what a surprise.|\n|When someone says something that is very obvious:|Really, Sherlock? No! You are clever.|\n|When someone does something wrong:|Very good; well done!|\n\n[**Lastly, an example of a sarcastic meme**](https://www.reddit.com/r/sarcasm/comments/3td6r0/arrows/)**,** because I'm sick of seeing memes that have nothing to do with sarcasm on a SARCASM subreddit.", "title": "READ BEFORE POSTING! - /r/sarcasm", "downs": 0, "ups": 18, "score": 18, "name": "t3_ddhn0c", "created_utc": 1570244142.0}

Everyone's abuzz about the latest Star Wars movie coming out and probably can't wait to see it. We all know how much people love spoilers, so go ahead and blurt out a major spoiler in a really obnoxious tone.\n2. **Insist on discussing the impeachment inquiry.** Christmas is one of the few times we get to escape politics, and we all know how sad a day without political argument is. As you're passing the gravy, bring up Gordon Sondland. Everyone will thank you for it!\n3. **Buy your nephew a Frozen toy.** This is especially good if your nephew is between the ages of 8-10. We all know how much boys love Frozen, so go ahead and buy your nephew a Frozen toy (bonus points if it plays Let it Go). It'll be his favorite present!\n4. **Buy the teen the wrong phone case**. Do you have an iPhone-obsessed teen in your family? If so, she probably would like another phone case. However, get her a case for an older phone, or better yet, an Android phone case. She'll have the same look of joy you had when you got Mega Bloks instead of Lego!\n5. **Buy DVDs from the Walmart discount bin**. DVDs are slowly facing their extinction, especially with all the new streaming services. We all know how much people love obsolete technology and obscure movies.

I mean, I have WiFi two rooms over, but ITS NOT ENOUGH. And she\u2019s already short on time these days with never exercising and sending me dozens of snapchats a day on how she\u2019s never going to get a degree.\n\nSo, I\u2019m begging, if her school could reopen ASAP, our state could rollback shelter in place orders and risk another harsher wave, or if everyone could stop dying horrifying suffocating deaths at an exponential rate while thousands lose their jobs, lose their loved ones without a goodbye, and be stuck in abusive households, she would be grateful.

Like it could be summer in July in Ny, and someone could ask \"is it hot outside?\" I would clearly reply  \"yeah no it's definitely chilly out you should put on a jacket\". Isnt it clear that its hot outside? Nyc weather fluctuates but not like that. \n    One personal example I have would be  the one person in the world ive ever met that i have to literally say \" oh lmao i was just tryna be funny\". One day she tells me someone rang her doorbell and left a box on her porch. She tells me no one ever comes to her apartment at this time of night and she is  confused. She looks around and boxes are on everyone else's porch too, so she wont open it and is \"scared it may a bomb\" and is deadly serious. So I say \"lol what type of enemies do you have that they would leave a bomb on your doorstep in nyc? ISIS??\". Then suddenly it turns serious and she says \" well I dont have any enemies, and you act like people just dont hurt other innocent people for no reason\". Yes clearly I understand that there are homegrown terrorist who in fact terrorize people, It's almost night time, its super crazy in america right now, and the person left without saying anything , but a bomb?? Come to find out it was just a box of fruit because there are nice people out there trying to help during the pandemic. Of course after all that fussing she threw it out cause she \"dont trust like that\" (eric andre show). Now im put off and I dont  want to talk because were 21 and you sound like my grandmother. Jesus would tell my granny that there may be a bomb but if it isnt then just to throw it out anyway. \ud83d\ude44\n      Can someone please it explain to me. I know everyone's thought process is different and some people on the spectrum can only think linear but like I said ,what about the people who can tell when your sad, happy, angry, excited, disgusted, anxious, frustrated, and can laugh at an occasional stunningly obvious joke with a punchline but is stone face or literally confused regarding sarcasm?? Lmao am I really just a horrible person? Clearly I have to be right?\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude2d", "title": "how do people not get sarcasm", "downs": 0, "ups": 38, "score": 38, "name": "t3_i7n37g", "created_utc": 1597129442.0}

A prejudiced person might call some folks like this \"thugs,\" because they have had trouble with the law, but I think Citadel LLC, who is responsible for about %40 of the investment traffic on Robinhood, paid their dues to society with that fine last July, and Plotkin left his last employer, SAC Capital presumably because he did not want to be associated with the insider trading behavior that was being investigated there. If you're worried about the futures of folks like this who might be down on their luck despite their best efforts, I have a great solution: congress can grant a special incentive for new small investors who choose to hold on to their assets after an initial short gain to reinforce stability and reduce market volatility, then those investors, after they've been certain they'll all continue to be getting revenue from their collaboration and from the special treatment by the government, can take all that money and let it trickle back down to Mr. Plotkin's new manager's McDonalds or (temporarily) for-profit prison.", "title": "The people behind the money in these troubling times...", "downs": 0, "ups": 12, "score": 12, "name": "t3_l91yef", "created_utc": 1612059037.0}

As a special addition John Dean will be there to cameo his role in the coverup and the subsequent tell-all at the hearings. The next day will be especially significant since I will be meeting the current President. Well, not actually meeting him but I will be able to see him in his most comfortable chair nodding off. I'm told that Kamala will also be there with her tiara just standing by and waiting. Then there will be a walking tour of the Capitol area to see all the famous statues and monuments that have been there for all to see for many decades. I am assured that I will be able to see the Lincoln Memorial through the fence and the machine gun carrying National Guardswomen standing behind the fence. A highlight of this tour will be a face-to-face meeting with Pelosi who will stand on the inside of the fence and shout out \"HEY, YOU THERE, ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE NASTY TRUMP INSURRECTIONISTS?\" I can't quite wait for that one. I think she may even hand me one of those $1,400 checks to make sure I vote for her in the next election. All-in-all I think this will be one of my most memorable vacations.

Anyone is young compared to a certain age, right? I mean, who the heck people think they are by wanting something at that age, JUST STOP WANTING, wait for not to be young, then you can go back wanting, it is so easy. Just look at Van Gogh for example, wanting to be a respected artist at what? 40 years old? Pff kids these days. \n2. Seek help! - Well, yes, I mean, thank you captain obvious for making me realize I need help, but you should have warned me I need to drink water and eat food too. Jokes apart this is a wonderful piece of advice because it makes you look empathetic when you are actually making people worse. You see, how is anyone going to argue with that? Of course someone asking for advice needs help, scpecially when it is about mental little problems, am I right? But don't worry, maybe the person is stupid enough to notice he she needs help, or maybe... you are too intelligent...\n3. Get over it! - Isn't this what Scorpion said to Sub zero? GET OVER IIIITTTT!!! Or it was something like that, I don't remember. But if a mortal ninja says so, it is good, right? This one in particular is for you to look chaddish, cool, relaxed, good vibes and making the person to know he she is ruining your good vibes. You see, when you are adult, you just get over it. And you tell the kids to get over it. When they can't have that Fortnite skin and star crying: Get over it! When they can't do their math homework and start crying: Get over it! And then there are these kids on reddit with their kids problem like being worried on getting cheated, thinking on killing themselves or suffering for narcisistic parents. AGAIN, kids these days, pff. They seriously need to get over themselves.\n4. But you won't accept any advice!!!! - Ok, this is a tricky one. For you to use this, it means the person has a little more IQ than 60 and felt just a tiny bit uncorfortable with our (crap) advice here. But this is what you got to do, he she asked for advice right? And you gave him her the BEST advice, right? How dare this mofo not take the advice then? I mean, if you ask for an x-ray, who cares if you get cancer? It was you that wanted the x-ray, it is not toxic, it is just you with your need for validation. See how are these people? They ask for something then complain when they get our generosity of giving them the best something, unbelievable...\n5. Ad hominem - Add what? Don't come with this mexican crap here!!! Just kidding, this is just a latin fancy term that means \"to the man\". If you have done step 4 and it seems the person still has a little more than 60 of IQ, you will have to shoot ad hominem arguments. It is quite simple and every good redditor must know, it is like this: You ignore the person's problems completely, then you look for something that you could use to insult, so you will have to step out of giving advice for a moment and start saying some things. And then you ask me: Insult? Are you promoting insulting? - Nonononono, don't worry, don't worry. It is not quite an insult if it is true, right? Look, if you had to do this, the person is clearly an idiot. To not take any of our advice, must be an idiot for sure, so you will just be saying the truth nothing but the truth. Besides, it will make you feel superior, and trust me, the sensation of being superior by putting others down will prove you to be better than an orgasm.\n\nWell I gues that is it! you are now a fully trained redditor! How about us to put this knowledge in practice? To start, you may try r/relationship_advice, r/dating_advice and r/Advice. You can't go wrong with those! Be safe and remember: The world needs you.
